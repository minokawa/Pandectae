SYLLABUS

  

1. TRUSTS; LEGAL CONCEPT OF A TRUST; TRUSTEE CANNOT INVOKE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AGAINST "CESTUIS QUE TRUSTENT." — The juridical concept of a trust, which in a broad sense involves, arises from, or is the result of, a fiduciary relationship between the trustee and the cestui que trust as regards certain property — real, personal, funds or money, or choses in action — must not be confused with an action for specific performance. When the claim to the lots in the cadastral case was withdrawn by the respondents relying upon the assurance and promise made in open court by Dr. MY on behalf of JY y R., the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, a trust or a fiduciary relationship between them arose, or resulted therefrom, or was created thereby. The trustee cannot invoke the statute of limitations to bar the action and defeat the right of the cestuis que trustent.

The defendant alleged, as a special defense, that the allegations in the complaint do not constitute a cause of action and that The deadline for filing the suit has expired; and, by way of counterclaim, the plaintiffs are asked to be ordered to vacate their respective plots.

  

The defendant having died, the complaint was amended to replace him by his children, all of whom were minors, represented by their guardian Dolores Pacheco, who also filed amended answers.

  

The Court decided the matter in favor of the plaintiffs. and against the defendant, and in its decision it made the following statement of facts: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph

  

"The plaintiffs were the claimants of the lots mentioned in the complaint, all located on Zamora and Quennon Streets in the municipality of Isabela in this province, against the opposition of the defendant Jose Yulo y Regalado who also claimed them for himself; but this and the former having come to an understanding that if the names of said streets were changed from Zamora and Quennon to T. Yulo and G. Regalado, respectively, which were the names of the defendant's parents, namely: Teodoro Yulo and Gregoria Regalado; said defendant would be willing to cede said lots to their respective claimants, an agreement which was made in open court, presided over by the Honorable Judge Norberto Romualdez, having been noted by the taguigrapher Mr. Tanjuequiao, as recorded in Exhibit 'B', the plaintiffs, who were then assisted by their attorney Don Agustin P. Seva, withdrew their respective claims as well as the evidence they had already submitted. practiced before the Arbitrator Judge in support of his said claims, thus giving rise to the said lots being awarded in the name of the said defendant, the corresponding decrees and titles being later issued in his favor and the latter were for a long time in the possession of the municipal treasurer of Isabela without being collected by the said defendant.

  

"After many efforts had been made, since it was necessary to pass a law authorizing the municipalities to change the names of the streets that are within their respective jurisdictional terms, a resolution was issued by the Municipal Council of Isabela ordering the change of the names of the streets already mentioned and once said resolution was approved by the Honorable Provincial Board of Negros Occidental, the change was carried out by executive order of the President of said municipality in February 1934.

  

"The defendant for the first time partially complied with the above-mentioned agreement, granting in the months of May and June of 1928 Exhibits D, E, F, G, H and I in favor of the claimants mentioned therein, donating to them the lots that corresponded to them, and by virtue of said deeds the favored claimants obtained the transfer of the title of said lots in their favor in the Property Registry of this province. The other claimants followed the example and went to see the aforementioned defendant to request that the lots that each of them claimed also be transferred to them, and he indicated that they should order the corresponding deed to be prepared by the lawyer Don Hugo P. Rodriguez who had been representing the aforementioned defendant Jose Yulo y Regalado in life in this case, and after his death he has also been representing him and until now he is representing his heirs, but said defendant did not want to sign said deeds until he passed away, alleging that the claimants had behaved ungratefully.

  

"The plaintiffs brought the present action to compel the defendant or his heirs to respect the agreement between them and the aforementioned defendant and to grant the corresponding deeds of donation of their respective lots. "The representation of the aforementioned defendant or his heirs invokes as a

  

first defense the prescription that has not been interrupted, according to said representation, by the granting of Exhibits D to I, in addition to other defenses based on technicalities that would be tedious to enumerate, precisely because, in the opinion of the Court, it is unnecessary to make pronouncements on the issues thus raised by the defense for the purposes of this decision." cralaw virtua1aw library

  

He then made the following considerations: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph

  

"Without taking into account the merits of the allegations and evidence provided by the plaintiffs that prior to the cadastral measurement and upon inspection of the lots mentioned in the complaint, they were the owners and possessors of the same, since in fact they continue to possess them, having paid the corresponding land taxes from the beginning; and without taking into account the value of the decrees and certificates of title issued in favor of the defendant who managed to acquire them by virtue of the withdrawal of the claims of the plaintiffs, as well as the evidence produced by them by virtue of the defendant's promise to transfer or donate said lots to them as soon as the condition mentioned above was fulfilled, the court is of the opinion that the defendant has constituted himself a mere depositary of said titles awarded to him with the express obligation to transfer them to their respective owners as soon as the condition imposed by him and accepted by them is fulfilled, and when there is a deposit with a fiduciary character, there is no prescription, since we have several decisions of the Honorable Supreme Court of the Philippines in which the doctrine has been established that the right of the beneficiaries who, by trust, allowed someone as a depositary, to acquire the title of a land with the obligation to transfer it to them, never prescribes in favor of the one who thus acquires the title by virtue of the deposit with a fiduciary character.

  

"It would be highly unjust, illegal and would constitute an unprecedented dispossession if poor farmers were dispossessed of land inherited from their ancestors who acquired it by clearing, tilling or with the product of their work and the sweat of their brow, only because they had confidence in the person of the defendant who, in their opinion, was worthy of it, confidence supported by the agreement between them and the aforementioned defendant in the presence of the Court, and by virtue of which they withdrew their claims, on the understanding that the land they claimed would be transferred to them without the need for a lawsuit if the condition imposed by the defendant was fulfilled, if the defendant is now allowed, by means of technicalities, to keep the land awarded in his favor and that its current owners would be deprived, when the Court is aware that said defendants were not given the opportunity to prove their claims by means of the promise of a transfer or donation in their favor.

  

"It is true that apparently any action the plaintiffs had to claim ownership of the aforementioned lots which they continue to occupy as owners by virtue of the clear provisions of the Property Registry Law has prescribed if value were given to the defense based exclusively on technicalities that the defendant interposes in his report, but the Court believes that these defenses have no application whatsoever to the present case which falls perfectly within what in American law is called "Trust." virtual library

  

"Even assuming that the claimants had no right to be declared owners of the lots in controversy, the defendant cannot now allege this lack of right to fail to comply with the commitment made by which he has been constituted as a mere depositary of the title he acquired over said lots.

  

'An agreement entered into upon a supposition of a right or of a doubtful right though it afterwards comes out that the right was on the other side, shall be binding, and the right shall not prevail against the agreement of the parties; for the right must always be on one side or the other, and therefore the compromise or a doubtful right is a sufficient foundation for an agreement.

"Therefore, the Court renders judgment ordering the defendant or his heirs to execute in favor of each and every plaintiff a deed of assignment of the lots each of them claims, with costs to the defendant." virtual law library

"After the above-numbered lot was inspected, the following actions took place: jgc:chanrobles.com.ph

  

"Mr. Pablo Garcia de Isabela stated that he has spoken with each and every one of the councilors of Isabela, and that they have agreed to approve a resolution to name Zamora Street after Mr. Teodoro Yulo and Quennon Street after Gregoria Regalado, both streets in the center of the town of Isabela.

  

"In view of these statements by the attorney for the claimants of the forty-odd lots, more or less, located on said streets and disputed between Mr. Yulo and the occupants of said lots, Mr. Jose Yulo, represented by Dr. Mariano Yulo, agrees to donate these parcels of land to the claimants as soon as a resolution is approved by the Municipal Board of Isabela and duly approved by the Provincial Board, to name the streets above mentioned Teodoro Yulo and Gregoria Regalado; It being understood that if any subsequent Municipal Council should resolve to change the names of said streets again and this last resolution should be put into practice, then the ownership that governs each of the lots referred to herein will revert to the donor. Taking into account all these statements, the claimants' attorney waives the right to present his evidence.

  

"The opponents' attorney, in view of this arrangement, states that he withdraws all the evidence provided by their representatives before the Isabela Arbitration Judge on the lots to which said transaction refers.

  

"It should be made clear that Mr. Yulo's commitment is to make a donation of each and every one of these lots to their current occupants, not necessarily for the entire extension of the lot, but of that part that he will determine later, and that in doing so, he is obliged not to destroy buildings or crops of the occupants of these lots. It is understood that in case of reduction, this will take place not precisely in front of the lots that face Zamora Street but on the opposite side to the South.

Said evidence having been presented before the same Court that saw the Cadastre of Isabela, and before whom what is recorded in the Exhibit B, we are of the opinion that such certification was unnecessary, since the Court could take judicial notice of the content of the aforementioned document.

  

It is also alleged that since Exhibit B does not constitute a contract signed by the defendant, it cannot be presented as evidence under the statute of frauds and its content cannot be proven by oral evidence. We understand that the statute of frauds is only applicable to valid contracts and not to consummated ones, such as those partially entered into in open court and by virtue of which Jose Yulo y Regalado obtained title to the lots belonging to the plaintiffs, since they are the ones who possess them and have always possessed them. When it is a question of proving fraud, oral evidence is admissible. (Yacapin versus Neri, 40 Phil., 61.) The plaintiffs having withdrawn their opposition in the cadastral record by virtue of the promise made by the defendant in open court, the latter is now in estoppel to deny the existence of said agreement.

  

As to the statute of limitations on the plaintiffs' action, we believe that the lower court was correct in concluding that the title to the said lots had been issued to the defendant as trustee and, therefore, that he is obliged to transfer the same to the defendant at any time. This case is similar to the case of Bantigui v. Platon, RGNo. 31317. There the opponents withdrew their opposition in view, according to the court, of the evidence of the petitioner. Later, however, they filed a suit to compel the petitioner to transfer certain portions of the land decreed in their favor, the opponents' attorney having stated at the hearing that the opposition was withdrawn because of the petitioner's promise to transfer later the portions claimed by the opponents. The court granted the request in the suit, and this decision was confirmed by the Supreme Court.

  

Based on all the above, and not finding any error of fact or law in the appealed decision, we confirm it in all its parts with costs to the appellant.

  

The foregoing discloses that the respondents, the plaintiffs in civil case No. 6088 of the Court of First Instance of Occidental Negros and the appellees in CA-GR No. 5700 of the Court of Appeals, filed responses in the cadastral case No. 11, GLRO cadastral record No. 100, claiming lots as their property and began to present evidence before a referee appointed by the court in support of their respective claims. Upon the assurance and promise made in open court by Dr. Mariano Yulo, who represented the late predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners in the cadastral case, the defendant in civil case No. 6088 and the appellant in CA-GR No. 5700 , that, after the change of Zamora and Quennon Streets of the municipality of Isabela, province of Occidental Negros, into T. Yulo and G. Regalado Streets, respectively, the names of the deceased parents of the defendant Jose Yulo y Regalado, the latter would convey and assign the lots to the claimants, the herein respondents withdrew their claims, and the cadastral court confirmed the title to the lots and decreed their registration in the name of the defendant Jose Yulo y Regalado. In other words, the plaintiffs and appellees in the courts below and now respondents asserted title to each lot claimed by them and began to present evidence to prove title thereto in the cadastral case, but because of the promise referred to to be made in open court by the representative of the defendant-appellant, the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, the respondents withdrew their claims based upon such promise. That finding is of fact and cannot be reviewed by this Court. 1 It does not appear — it is not even hinted — that the admission as evidence of the copy of the transcript of the stenographic notes taken by the official stenographer, upon which that finding is predicated, was objected to by the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners. The original transcript was part of the record of the cadastral case and the trial court admitted it as evidence and based the judgment rendered in the case upon it. The fact that the copy of the transcript (Exhibit B) attached to the record of this case is not certified or authenticated by the clerk of court who is the legal keeper thereof is no reason for disregarding it as evidence, for the original transcript attached to the record of the cadastral case must have been read and taken into consideration by the judge of the trial court. At any rate, there having been no objection to the admission of the unauthenticated copy of the transcript, the question of its admissibility cannot now be raised. The uncontroverted and undisputed finding of the trial court, confirmed by the Court of Appeals, that the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners had complied with the promise by executing deeds of donation or assignment to some of the claimants, as shown in or by Exhibits D, E, F, G, H, and I,is a strong proof or corroboration of the truth or authenticity of the contents of the unauthenticated copy of the transcript of the stenographic notes referred to marked Exhibit B. In these circumstances, its probative value cannot be disregarded much less assailed.

  

Counsel asserts that a trustee does not have title to the property which is the subject of the trust, because title to such property is vested in the cestui que trust. Hence — he argued — if the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners was a trustee, he or his successors-in-interest could not and cannot be compelled in an action for specific performance to convey or assign the property — the subject of the trust — because in an action for specific performance — counsel contends — the party to be compelled to perform is the owner or has the title to the property sought to be conveyed or assigned.

  

The juridical concept of a trust, which in a broad sense involves, arises from, or is the result of, a fiduciary relationship between the trustee and the trust as regards certain property — real, personal, funds or money, or choses in action — must not be confused with an action for specific performance. When the claim to the lots in the cadastral case was withdrawn by the respondents relying upon the assurance and promise made in open court by Dr. Mariano Yulo on behalf of Jose Yulo y Regalado, the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners, a trust or a fiduciary relationship between them arose, or resulted therefrom, or was created thereby. The trustee cannot invoke the statute of limitations to bar the action and defeat the right of the cestuis que trustent. If the pretense of counsel for the petitioners that the promise above warned cannot prevail over the final decree of the cadastral court holding the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners to be the owner of the lots claimed by the respondents were to be sustained and upheld, then actions to compel a party to assign or convey the undivided share in a parcel of land registered in his name to his co-owner or co-heir could no longer be brought and could no longer succeed and prosper.

  

It is contended that lot 224 was claimed in the cadastral case by the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioners alone, and not as adjudged in this case by the trial court and confirmed by the Court of Appeals that it was also claimed by one of the respondents, one of the plaintiffs in the court below. This also is a question of fact which cannot be reviewed in these proceedings.

  

The judgment under review is affirmed, with costs against the petitioners.
