BRION, J.:

  

Pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, we review the decision1 and the resolution2 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR No. 29371 which denied the appeal of Nenita Carganillo (petitioner). The CA affirmed, with modification as to penalty, the judgment3 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 30, Cabanatuan City, convicting the petitioner of the crime of estafa, defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph l(b) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

  

THE CASE

  

On September 23, 1998, Teresita Lazaro, a rice trader in Rizal, Nueva Ecija, gave the petitioner the amount of ₱132,000.00 for the purpose of buying palay. The petitioner, who was alleged tobe an "ahente" or agent in the buy-and-sell of palay, agreed to deliver the palayto the Lazaro Palay Buying Station on or before November 28, 1998. According to the "Kasunduan" signed by the petitioner, the parties agreed that for every kilo of palaybought the petitioner shall earn a commission of twenty centavos (P0.20). But if no palayis purchased and delivered on November 28, the petitioner must return the ₱132,000.00 to Teresita within one (1) week after November 28.

  

After failing to receive any palayor the ₱132,000.00 on November 28 and one (1) week thereafter, respectively, Teresita made oral and written demands to the petitioner for the return of the ₱132,000.00 but her demands were simply ignored. She thus filed an affidavit-complaint for estafa against the petitioner before the Fiscal’s Office. Thereafter, an Information4 for the crime of estafawas filed in court.

  

The petitioner pleaded not guilty tothe crime and denied that she entered into a "principal-agent" agreement with, and received the ₱132,000.00 from, Teresita. She alleged that she owedTeresita a balance of ₱13,704.32 for the fertilizers and rice that she purchased from the latter in 1995 and 1996,5 and that, in November 1996, she was made to sign a blank "Kasunduan" that reflected no written date and amount.6 She likewise denied personally receiving any written demand letter from Teresita.7

  

In a decision dated November 19, 2004, the RTC convicted the petitioner of the crime of estafaand sentenced her to suffer, applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, imprisonment ranging from four (4) years and one (1) day of prision correccional as minimum to twenty (20) years of reclusion temporal as maximum.8 Also, the RTC ordered the petitioner to indemnify Teresita the sum of ₱132,000.00 representing the amount embezzled and to pay the costs of suit.9

  

On appeal, the CA affirmed the petitioner’s conviction.10 The CA held that the prosecution properly established the elements of the crime of estafa. In debunking petitioner’s claim that her agreement with Teresita was merely a money loan, the CA stated that:

  

In this case, the Kasunduan dated September 23, 1998, which-accusedappellant admittedly signed, is clear inits tenor and the failure to comply therewith makes out a case for estafa. Accused-appellant’s insistence that she signed the said Kasunduan in blank is belied by her admission of "the existence or authenticity of the documentary exhibits x x x" during the prosecution’s formal offer of evidence and her own testimony x x x.

  

Further, the CA ruled as immaterial the petitioner’s defense that she did not personally receive a writtenletter of demand from Teresita. The CA held that even a verbal query as tothe whereabouts of the money suspected to be misappropriated isalready tantamount to a demand, and that the petitioner failed to refute Teresita’s claim that she went to the petitioner’s house to ask for the palayand/or the return of the ₱132,000.00.11

  

The CA, however, found error inthe RTC’s computation of the penalty and imposed upon the petitioner an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years and two (2) months of prision correccional, as minimum, to eight (8) years of prision mayor, as maximum, plus one (1) year for each additional ₱10,000.00 (in excess of ₱22,000.00), equivalent to eleven (11) years, or a total of nineteen (19) years.12

  

The petitioner elevated her judgment of conviction to the Court by filing a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.

  

THE PETITION

  

In her petition, the petitioner raisesthe sole issue of whether the CA erred in affirming (with modification)the judgment of conviction against her, despite the prosecution’s failure to prove her guilt of the crime of estafa beyond reasonable doubt.

  

The petitioner maintains that she isnot engaged in the business of buying and selling palayand that the "Kasunduan" between her and Teresita does not contain their real agreement of a simple money loan. She argues that the prosecution failed to establish all the elements of estafa because she never received the ₱132,000.00 from Teresita; that an element of the crime is that "the offender receives the money, or goods or other personal property in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligations involving the duty to deliver, or to return, the same."

  

THE COURT’S RULING

  

We deny the present petition. The CA did not commit any reversible error in its decision of September 10, 2007.

  

Under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, the offense of estafacommitted with abuse of confidence requires the following elements:

  

(a) that money, goods or other personal property is received by the offender in trust or on commission, orfor administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same[;]

  

(b) that there be misappropriation or conversion of such money or property by the offender, or denial on his part of such receipt[;]

  

(c) that such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and

  

(d) there is demand by the offended party to the offender.13

  

We find that all the elements of estafa are present in this case: that the petitioner received in trust the amount of ₱132,000.00 from Teresita for the purpose of buying palayand misappropriated it when she failed to return the said amount to Teresita upon demand.

  

As the CA and the RTC did, we find worthy of credit and belief the "Kasunduan" presented in evidence by the prosecution that was admittedly signed by the petitioner and which contained the terms of agreement between her and Teresita. This document clearly stated that the petitioner received in trust the amount of ₱132,000.00 from Teresita for the purpose of buying palaywith the corresponding obligationsto (1) deliver the palay to the Lazaro Palay Buying Station on or before November 28, 1998, and (2) return the ₱132,000.00 to Teresita one week after November 28 in the event that the petitioner failed to make palay purchases.

  

It is settled that the agreement or contract between the parties is the formal expression of the parties’ rights, duties, and obligations and is the best evidence of the parties’ intention.Thus, when the terms of an agreement have been reduced into writing, it is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement.14 However, this rule, known as the Parol Evidence Rule, admits of exceptions.

  

Section 9, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court provides that a party to a written agreement may present evidence to modify, explain or add to the terms of the agreement if he puts in issue in his pleading the following:

  

(a) An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection in the written agreement;

  

(b) The failure of the written agreement to express the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto;

  

(c) The validity of the written agreement; or

  

(d) The existence of other terms agreed to by the parties or their successors in interest after the execution of the written agreement.

  

x x x x

  

In this case, the petitioner alleges that the subject "Kasunduan" failed to express the real agreement between her and Teresita; that theirs was a plain and simple loan agreement and not that of a principal-agent relationship in the buy-and-sell of palay. The documentary and testimonial evidence presented by the petitioner, however, fail to support her claims.

  

The RTC found that the receipts presented by the petitioner to prove her loan obligation with Teresitawere vague, undated and unsigned.15 Also, the RTC observed that the witnesses who testified that they saw the petitioner sign the "Kasunduan" were not even certain of the real transaction between the petitioner and Teresita.16 These findings of fact and evidence, which were affirmed by the CA, are accorded respect and finality by this Court. Where the factual findings of the trial court are affirmed in toto by the Court of Appeals, there is great reason not to disturb these findings and to regard them not reviewable by this Court.17

  

Also, we cannot sustain the petitioner’s claim that she had been the victim of a fraud becauseTeresita deceived her into signing a blank document; that she signed the "Kasunduan," even if it had no date and amount written on it, because Teresita led her to believe that the document would be used merely for show purposes with the bank.18

  

For fraud to vitiate consent, the deception employed must be the causal (dolo causante) inducement to the making of the contract,19 and must be serious in character.20 It must be sufficient to impress or lead an ordinarily prudent person into error, taking into account the circumstances of each case.21

  

In this case, we find no vitiated consent on the part of the petitioner. In her Memorandum22 to this Court, she narrated that after she signed the "Kasunduan," Teresita subsequently made her execute a deed of sale over her property, which deed she refused to sign.23 This statement negates the petitioner’s self-serving allegation that she was tricked by Teresita into signing a blank "Kasunduan," as she was fully aware of the possible implications of the act of signing a document.

  

We affirm the correctness of the penalty imposed by the CA, as it is fully in accordance with the law.1âwphi1 We explained in People v. Temporada24 that:

  

"The prescribed penalty for estafaunder Article 315, par. 2(d) of the RPC, when the amount defrauded exceeds ₱22,000.00, is prisión correccional maximum to prisión mayor minimum. The minimum term is taken from the penalty next lower or anywhere within prisión correccional minimum and medium (i.e., from 6 months and 1 day to 4 years and 2 months). xxx

  

On the other hand, the maximum term is taken from the prescribed penalty of prisión correccional maximum to prisión mayor minimum in its maximum period, adding 1 year of imprisonment for every ₱10,000.00 in excess of ₱22,000.00, provided that the total penalty shall not exceed 20 years. xxx To compute the maximum period of the prescribed penalty, prisión correccional maximum to prisión mayor minimum should be divided into three equal portions oftime each of which portion shall be deemed to form one period in accordance with Article 65 of the RPC. Following this procedure,the maximum period of prisión correccional maximum to prisión mayor minimum is from 6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years. The incremental penalty, when proper, shall thus be added to anywhere from6 years, 8 months and 21 days to 8 years, at the discretion of the court.

  

In computing the incremental penalty, the amount defrauded shall be subtracted by ₱22,000.00, and the difference shall be divided by ₱10,000.00. Any fraction of a year shall be discarded as was done starting with the case of People v. Pabalan in consonance with the settled rule that penal laws shall be construed liberally in favor of the accused. xxx"25

  

In the recent case of Lito Corpuz v. People of the Philippines,26 we recognized the "perceived injustice" brought about by the range of penalties that the courts continue to impose on crimes against property, such as estafa, committed today based on the amount of damage measured by the value of money eight years ago in 1932. This Court, however, cannot modify these range of penalties in our decisions, as such action would be an impermissible encroachment upon the power of the legislative branch of government and would constitute proscribed judicial legislation.

  

WHEREFORE, premises considered, we DENY the petition for lack of merit. We AFFIRM the decision dated September 10, 2007 and the resolution dated March 18, 2008 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR No. 29371, finding petitioner Nenita Carganillo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of estafa penalized under Article 315, paragraph l(b) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.

  

SO ORDERED.
