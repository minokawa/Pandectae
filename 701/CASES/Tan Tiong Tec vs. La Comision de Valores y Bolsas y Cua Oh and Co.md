G.R. No. L-46472 January 23, 1940

  

TAN TIONG TECK, appellant, vs. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, and CUA OH & CO., respondents.

  

Mr. Jose B. Laurel representing the appellant.

Mr. Emerito M. Ramos representing the respondents.

  

DIAZ, J.: chanrobles virtual law library

  

The issue at issue here is whether respondent Cua Oh & Co. is required to pay appellant the difference between the value of certain 10,000 shares of Gold Shares owned by it, which it had delivered to the appellant for sale, computed at the price of P0.15 each, and the actual price at which the same were sold. Respondent was then a stock broker, registered as such in the records of the Securities and Exchange Commission. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

In the administrative file No. 31 of the aforementioned Securities and Exchange Commission, which the appellant had to promote against the respondent to complain against it and to force it to pay said difference, for having refused to do so voluntarily, the latter admitted having in effect received the aforementioned shares to sell them not at a fixed price but at a price of no less than P0.15 each. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

After the appellant's complaint was received for proof, the Commission issued its decision of June 25, 1938, in which, after declaring that the appellant's claim was based on nothing more than a prima facie presumption that his shares were not sold, it dismissed the case without further proceedings, because, despite having requested reconsideration of its decision, it did not reconsider it. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

The appellant filed an appeal against the decision of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in order to have it reviewed. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

Without disregarding the provisions of section 35 of Commonwealth Act No. 83, which provide that findings of fact by the Securities and Exchange Commission in matters of the nature of this case shall be deemed conclusive on appeal, we are compelled to declare that the decision appealed from is not consistent with law for the following reasons: the Commission erred in considering the parties' pleadings; in considering the facts established at the hearing; and in interpreting the scope and meaning of Exhibits A and B which principally form the basis of its decision, considering them as absolutely certain fact. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

It should be said first of all that the following allegations are contained in the appellant's complaint in the aforementioned administrative file No. 31:

  

1. That the complainant is of legal age, married, and a resident of the City of Manila, Philippines, with mailing address at 142 Rosario, Manila;chanrobles virtual law library

  

2. That the respondent is a stock broker duly registered in the Register of Brokers of this Commission and a member of the International Stock Exchange with mailing address at 119 Crystal Arcade, Manila;chanrobles virtual law library

  

3. That on June 15, 1937, the complainant gave an order to sell 10,000 Gold Shares at a minimum price of P0.15 to the respondent thru his salesman Mr. And Eng Ho; and that said respondent delivered to him (complainant) a copy of its confirmation slip showing that 10,000 Gold Shares of the complainant have been sold at P0.15 each;chanrobles virtual law library

  

4. That said sale of said 10,000 Gold Shares at P0.15 also appeared in the Statement of Account of the complainant sent to him on or about June 30, 1937;chanrobles virtual law library

  

5. That the complainant subsequently discovered that there was no such transaction appearing in the Quotation issued by the International Stock Exchange on June 15, 1937, nor were any Gold Shares sold at P0.15 each.

  

And the following unequivocal admission is also included in the contested party's response, in a manner that leaves no room for doubt:

  

That he admits paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and the first part of paragraph 5.

  

The facts that are recorded and emerge from the aforementioned documents are something that we cannot ignore when proceeding to review the appealed decision, because it refers to said documents and they constitute by themselves the best evidence or the best account that can be given of the true facts. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

The respondent, purporting to comply with Rule No. 3 of the Provisional Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which by virtue of the provisions of section 33 of Commonwealth Act No. 83 have the force of law, sent to the appellant its report or Exhibit A, on June 15, 1937, stating therein that it had sold its 10,000 shares at a price of P0.15 per share, on the morning of said day, subject to the rules of the International Stock Exchange. It is stated, however, in Exhibit B, which is the report that the International Stock Exchange filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to show the transactions it had on the aforementioned day, June 15, 1937, in compliance with the provisions of Rule 22 of the aforementioned Regulations, that if 1,195,000 shares of Gold Shares were sold, none were sold at the price of P0.15. All sales were at the following prices: 25,000 shares at P0.16 each; 45,000 shares at P0.163 each; 420,000 shares at P0.17 each; 275,000 shares at P0.185 each; 25,000 shares at P0.19 each; and 40,000 shares at P0.195 each. The respondent's claim that it sold the 10,000 shares of the appellant at a price of P0.15 per share must therefore be rejected, because, if it had done so, such a transaction would be recorded in Exhibit B, and the truth is that none of this is recorded there. The idea that the aforementioned 10,000 shares of the appellant were sold through the intervention of another securities office must also be rejected, because the respondent being a member of the International Stock Exchange, it was there where it had to carry out the sale; furthermore, the understanding that existed between it and the appellant, according to Exhibit A, was that the sale would be made subject to the rules of the International Stock Exchange. On the other hand, there is nothing to indicate that the sale was made with the intervention of another securities office. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

If we are to accept, as we must, the figures stated in Exhibit B, we must necessarily arrive at the conclusion that on the morning of the said day there were 20 sales of Gold Shares stock and that by virtue of these 725,000 shares changed hands, at prices which fluctuated between P0.16 and P0.195, the price of P0.175 being predominant because nearly half of said sales were made at that price, followed closely by those made at P0.17 because it was at that price that 215,000 shares were sold. In the transactions of the afternoon of the same day, there were only 7 sales, and all together they were of 470,000 shares, at a price which fluctuated between P0.17 and P0.185. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

It is therefore justified to conclude that the respondent sold the appellant's shares at a price of not less than P0.16, or at least P0.175, one. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

Bearing in mind the facts admitted by the respondent in its answer, it is clear how erroneous it is to conclude that when the appellant gave the respondent the order to sell its 10,000 shares, it did so by fixing the unalterable price of P0.15 per share. This is not, as can be seen, what the parties agreed upon, but precisely what has been said. There is therefore no reason not to declare that the respondent should have made the sale at the highest price at which the shares were quoted on the date in question; in other words, having as it did the necessary authorization to sell the appellant's shares at a price higher than P0.15 each, it is only fair that it be held responsible for the difference between the price at which it admitted to having sold said shares and said higher price at which, according to the evidence, or prima facie presumption as the Securities and Exchange Commission qualified it, it sold them. And there is no reason why we should not adopt and apply in this jurisdiction the "Highest Intermediate Value" rule, adopted in the United States, which is a fair rule and is universally accepted (8 Am. Jur., Brokers, Damages in Stock Transactions, sec. 217; Galigher v. Jones, 129 U.S. 193, 9 Sup. Ct. 335, 32 Law. ed. 658; Ling v. Malcom, 77 Conn. 517, 59 A. 598; Wiggin v. Federal Stock, etc. Co., 77 Conn. 507, 59 A. 627; Shaefer v. Dickinson, 141 Ill. A. 234; Rickerts v. Crittenden, 2 Ky. Op. 499; Dancy v. Hayward, 4 LA [Orleans] 111; Mullen v. Quinlan, 195 NY 109, 87 NE 1078, 23 LRANS 511; Gruman v. Smith, 81 NY 25; Baker v. Drake, 53 NY 211, 13 Am. Rep. 507; Barber v. Ellingwood, 144 App. Div. 512, 129 NYS 414; Rosenbaum v. Stiebel, 137 App. Div. 912 mem., 122 NYS 131; Keller v. Halsey, 130 App. Div. 389, 103 NY Super. 430; Peschke v. Wright, 93 Misc. 145, 156 NYS 773; Burridge v. Anthony, 1 NY City Ct. 244; Miller v. Lyons, 113 Va. 275, 74 SE 194; Wahl v. Tracy, 139 Misc. 668, 121 NW 660; Carnegie v. Federal Bank, 5 Ont. 418), and is not in conflict with any principle or provision of law in force in our country. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

But even if we were to ignore the rule mentioned above, we would still arrive at the same conclusion because we have laws here that force us to resolve the question in that sense. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

Article 255 of the Commercial Code prescribes that a commission agent should act with the prudence and tact that are expected of a good father of a family, taking care of the business entrusted to him as if it were his own. Bearing in mind this provision of law, and with the shares of Gold Shares being quoted on the market at the time of the proceedings at much more than P0.15 per share, it was to be expected that the respondent would sell the appellant's shares at the highest possible price, and not at the price of P0.15 which, by the way, was not recorded on that occasion. It would be absurd to even suppose that the respondent would act otherwise. On the date indicated (June 15, 1937), sales of Gold Shares shares amounted to 1,195,000 shares, according to the figures shown on Exhibit B, the authenticity of which has not been denied by the parties. chanroblesvirtualawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

The aforementioned article 255 of the Commercial Code states the following:

  

In any matter not expressly provided for and prescribed by the principal, the commissioner must consult him, provided that the nature of the business allows it. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

But if he is authorized to act at his own discretion, or consultation is not possible, he will do what prudence dictates and is most in accordance with commercial usage, taking care of the business as his own. . . .

  

We have a similar rule in articles 1714 and 1715 of the Civil Code. The first of these articles states that the agent must not exceed the limits of the mandate; and the last states that the limits of the mandate are not considered to have been exceeded if it were carried out in a manner more advantageous to the principal than that indicated by the latter. What the rules prohibit is that the commission agent or agent or commercial broker sells the things that he receives from his principal at a price lower than that fixed by the latter; they do not prevent him from selling those things at a higher price, if such price can be obtained. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

To all that has been said, this other consideration must be added: if the respondent had sold the appellant's shares at a price less than P0.16, since there were then buyers for a higher price, we would have the unusual case of the respondent having worked or acted against its own interests, because having the right, by law, to charge the appellant the corresponding commission according to the result of its work, a commission that would have been higher if its sale had also been at a higher price, it has waived said right. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

The facts on which the observations and considerations made are based are not contrary to or different from those expressed and clearly derived from the decision of the Securities and Exchange Commissioner, which is the subject of review. The Commissioner having mentioned, in his decision, the petitioner's complaint, the respondent's answer and Exhibits A and B, the four must necessarily be considered not only as a complement to the aforementioned decision, as regards the facts that each of them contains and shows on its face, but also as a story or part of the story of the true facts, made by the Commissioner. Therefore, the possible objection that no more facts can be taken into account than those declared proven by the Commissioner, by virtue of the aforementioned article 35 of Law No. 83, is not justified. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

In conclusion, we modify the judgment of the Commissioner of Securities and Exchanges, ordering the respondent to pay to the appellant, in addition to the sum of P1,500 on account of the amount of the 10,000 shares of Gold Shares, owned by her, at the rate of P0.15 each share, the difference between said sum and the P1,750 total amount of the aforementioned 10,000 shares at the rate of P0.175 each, or the amount of P250. chanroblesvirtuallawlibrary chanrobles virtual law library

  

The costs shall be assessed against the respondent Cua Oh & Co. It is so ordered.
