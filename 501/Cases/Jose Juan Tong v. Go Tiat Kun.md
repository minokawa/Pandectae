#### JOSE JUAN TONG, ET AL., PETITIONERS, VS. GO TIAT KUN, ET AL., RESPONDENTS.  

**Petitioners:**
- Nine of the ten children of Spouses Juan Tong and Sy Un
**Respondents:**
- The surviving heirs of Luis Juan Tong, Sr., the deceased tenth child of Spouses Juan Tong and Sy Un.

The case involves a disagreement between the heirs of Juan Tong and the heirs of Luis Juan Tong (Juan's son), Sr. regarding who rightfully owns the land.

The dispute in this case centers around the ownership and title of a parcel of land known as Lot 998-A of the Cadastral Survey of Iloilo.  The land was originally acquired by Juan Tong, who registered it in the name of his eldest son, Luis.  And because Juan Tong, is a Chinese citizen, he is disqualified from owning land in the Philippines. 

The petitioners, who are nine of the ten children of Juan Tong, argue that Lot 998-A was held in trust by Luis Juan Tong, Sr. for the benefit of the entire Juan Tong family.  They claim that although the land was registered in Luis, Sr.'s name, it was purchased with Juan money for the family's lumber business and was intended to remain a family property.

The grandchildren (heirs of Luis) assert that the respondents  breached this implied trust by claiming exclusive ownership of after Luis' death. By subdividing and selling parts of the land without the consent of the other family members.

They seek to nullify the titles and deeds executed by the respondents, arguing that they were done surreptitiously and fraudulently, depriving them of their rightful ownership. They, argue that
    
The respondents deny the existence of any trust agreement. And that Luis, Sr. purchased the land with his own money, and therefore, the property is his and should pass to his heirs. They also argue that the petitioners' claim is barred by prescription (i.e., too much time has passed) and laches (unreasonable delay in asserting a claim), meaning the petitioners no longer have the right to contest the ownership of the land.

The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioners, finding that an implied resulting trust existed, meaning Luis, Sr. held the land in trust for the entire family. The court nullified the titles and deeds executed by the respondents and ordered the reconveyance of the land to the petitioners. 

However, the Court of Appeals reversed this decision, siding with the respondents by concluding that there was no implied trust and that the petitioners' claims were barred by prescription, estoppel, and laches.

The petitioners then elevated the case to the Supreme Court, seeking a review of the Court of Appeals' decision. 

The Supreme Court ultimately found in favor of the petitioners, ruling that an implied resulting trust was indeed created, and the respondents' actions violated this trust. The Supreme Court granted the petitioners' claim to the land, nullified the titles and deeds executed by the respondents, and ordered the reconveyance of Lot 998-A to the petitioners.

The Court's Ruling

  
The petition is impressed with merit.  
  

The circumstances surrounding the acquisition of the subject property eloquently speak of the intent that the equitable or beneficial ownership of the property should belong to the Juan Tong family.  
  
Juan Tong had the financial means to purchase the property . 

	On the other hand, heirs of Luis, failed to present a single witness to corroborate their claim. Luis was merely working for his father where he received a monthly salary of P200.00 with free board and lodging.  
	  
	Second, the property was physically possessed by Juan Tong and was used as stockyard for their lumber business before it was acquired, and even after it was acquired. 
	  
	Third, from the time it was registered in the name of Luis, Sr. in 1957, Lot 998 remained undivided and untouched by the respondents.  
	  
	Luis Sr. never sent any letter or communication to the petitioners claiming ownership of Lot 998, and (4) he and his mother have a residence at Ledesco Village, La Paz, Iloilo City while his brother and sisters also have their own residences.  
	  
The real property taxes on Lot 998 were paid not by Luis Sr. but by his father Juan Tong and the Juan Tong Lumber. While some of the tax receipts were in the name of Luis, the fact that the Heirs of Juan were in possession of the originals thereof established that the petitioners, the Juan Tong Lumber, Inc., or the late Juan Tong paid for the taxes.
  
The principle of a resulting trust is based on the equitable doctrine that valuable consideration and not legal title determines the equitable title or interest and are presumed always to have been contemplated by the parties. 

They arise from the nature or circumstances of the consideration involved in a transaction whereby one person thereby becomes invested with legal title but is obligated in equity to hold his legal title for the benefit of another. 

On the other hand, a constructive trust, unlike an express trust, does not emanate from, or generate a fiduciary relation. 

Constructive trusts are created by the construction of equity in order to satisfy the demands of justice and prevent unjust enrichment. 

They arise contrary to intention against one who, by fraud, duress or abuse of confidence, obtains or holds the legal right to property which he ought not, in equity and good conscience, to hold.
  
The Supreme Court ultimately found in favor of the petitioners, ruling that an implied resulting trust was indeed created, and the respondents' actions violated this trust. The Supreme Court granted the petitioners' claim to the land, nullified the titles and deeds executed by the respondents, and ordered the reconveyance of Lot 998-A to the petitioners.
