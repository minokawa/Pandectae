The dispute in this case revolves around the ownership and validity of sales of three parcels of land originally owned by Margarita Cabacungan. The central issues include whether the properties were lawfully transferred to her son, Roberto Laigo, Jr., and whether Roberto had the legal right to sell the properties to the respondents, Marilou Laigo, Pedro Roy Laigo, and the spouses Mario and Julia Campos.

### Key Points of the Dispute:

1. **Transfer of Ownership**: In 1968, Margarita executed an Affidavit of Transfer of Real Property, transferring the properties to her son, Roberto. Margarita contended that this transfer was intended only to support Roberto's application for a U.S. visa and that she never intended to relinquish actual ownership.
    
2. **Sales of the Properties**: Roberto later sold the properties to the respondents. Margarita claimed that these sales were conducted without her knowledge and were invalid because Roberto was not the rightful owner.
    
3. **Annulment of Sales and Recovery of Property**: Margarita, represented by her daughter Luz, filed a complaint to annul the sales, recover ownership and possession of the properties, and cancel the tax declarations in Roberto's name. She argued that the sales were fictitious, fraudulent, and done in bad faith, with grossly inadequate prices.
    
4. **Defenses by Respondents**:
    
    - **Good Faith Purchasers**: The respondents claimed they were innocent purchasers for value and acted in good faith, relying on Roberto's representation of ownership.
    - **Prescription and Laches**: The respondents argued that Margarita's claims were barred by prescription and laches, as too much time had passed without her taking action to recover the properties.
5. **Court Decisions**:
    
    - **Trial Court**: The trial court dismissed Margarita's complaint, ruling that the 1968 Affidavit of Transfer was a valid transfer of ownership, and found that Margarita was guilty of laches. It also concluded that any implied trust had been extinguished by the passage of time.
    - **Court of Appeals**: The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision, agreeing that no implied trust was proven and that Margarita's claim was barred by laches and prescription.

The essence of the dispute is whether Margarita retained ownership of the properties despite the transfer to Roberto and whether the subsequent sales by Roberto were valid. The courts ultimately ruled against Margarita, finding that the properties were lawfully transferred to Roberto and that the sales to the respondents were valid, especially considering the defenses of prescription and laches.


The Supreme Court's decision in this case reversed the Court of Appeals' ruling and the Regional Trial Court's judgment, concluding as follows:

1. **Petition Granted**: The Supreme Court granted the petition and reversed the decisions of the lower courts.
    
2. **Cancellation of Tax Declarations**: It ordered the cancellation of the tax declarations for the disputed properties that were in Roberto D. Laigo's name.
    
3. **Nullification of Deeds of Sale**: The Court nullified the deeds of sale executed by Roberto D. Laigo in favor of respondents Pedro Roy Laigo and Marilou Laigo.
    
4. **Reconveyance Ordered**: The Court directed Pedro Roy Laigo and Marilou Laigo to execute a reconveyance of the properties back to the petitioner.
    

**Key Points**:

- The Supreme Court found that the properties were held in a resulting trust for Margarita, despite the Affidavit of Transfer being in Roberto's name.
- It was established that Roberto's actions constituted a wrongful conversion of the properties.
- The Court emphasized that, despite the lapse of time, the claim for reconveyance was not barred by laches or prescription because the properties were unregistered and the petitioner had acted within the legal timeframe upon learning of the fraud.
- The decision underscores the principle that a trust, including resulting and constructive trusts, will follow the property through all changes in state and form.
