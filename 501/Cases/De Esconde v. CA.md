G.R. No. 103635, February 01, 1996 


### **Petitioners (Constancia, Benjamin, Elenita, and Catalina Buan vda. de Esconde):**

1. **Annulment of Title**: They sought to annul the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 394 for Lot No. 1700, which was issued in favor of private respondent Pedro Esconde. They argued that the deed of extrajudicial partition was unenforceable concerning Lot No. 1700, and thus the property was wrongfully allocated to Pedro.
    
2. **Partition of Property**: They requested that Pedro Esconde enter into a partition agreement to distribute Lot No. 1700 among the heirs of Eulogio Esconde, asserting that they were entitled to a share of the property.
    
3. **Damages**: They sought damages related to the wrongful allocation of Lot No. 1700 and the resulting dispute.
    

### **Private Respondent (Pedro Esconde):**

1. **Exclusive Ownership**: Pedro Esconde claimed exclusive ownership of Lot No. 1700 based on the deed of extrajudicial partition executed in 1946, which allocated the lot to him. He argued that the deed was valid and that he had full rights over the property.
    
2. **Repudiation of Claims**: He disputed the petitioners' claims, asserting that the action filed by his siblings was barred by prescription and laches. He argued that the deed and the registration of the property in his name were legally binding and that any claims against this were untimely.
    
3. **Defense of Possession**: Pedro maintained that he had exercised exclusive rights over Lot No. 1700, including improvements and legal actions such as mortgaging the property, which further reinforced his claim of ownership.
    

The petitioners sought to overturn Pedro Esconde's title and redistribute the property, while Pedro Esconde defended his sole ownership based on the deed and argued that the petitioners' claims were barred by time limitations.

DECISION:

The Supreme Court ruled in favor of affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals,  based on an implied trust was barred by prescription and laches.

1. **Prescription and Laches**: The Court found that the action to annul the title to Lot No. 1700 was barred by prescription. The title was registered in 1947, and by applying a ten-year prescriptive period from the registration date, the action filed in 1987 was deemed to be outside the allowable period. Additionally, the doctrine of laches also applied, as the petitioners delayed their claim.
    
2. **Implied Trust**: The Court acknowledged that while the deed of extrajudicial partition created an implied trust due to a mistake in the allocation of Lot No. 1700, such a trust did not prevent the running of prescription. In constructive implied trusts, the statute of limitations runs even if the trustee does not explicitly repudiate the trust relationship.
    
3. **Indemnity for Improvements**: Although the petitioners' action for reconveyance was barred, the Court ordered private respondent Pedro Esconde to indemnify petitioner Benjamin Esconde for the expenses incurred on improvements made to Lot No. 1700, recognizing that the improvements were tolerated by Pedro.
    

In summary, while the petition for reconveyance was denied due to prescription and laches, the Court modified the decision to include compensation for improvements made by Benjamin Esconde.
