- **Plaintiff-Appellant**: Alfredo Roa, Sr. (now deceased and substituted by his heirs)
- **Defendants-Appellees**: Joaquin Casino and Custodia Valdehuesa (also known as Teodosia Valdehuesa), successors-in-interest of Pablo Valdehuesa.

### **Background**

1. **Original Dispute**: Alfredo Roa, Sr. filed a case to recover possession of a land parcel located in Bugo, which was registered under his name (Original Certificate of Title No. T-21D). He claimed that the defendants were occupying this land without his permission.
    
2. **Defendants' Claim**: Joaquin Casino and Custodia Valdehuesa argued that the land had belonged to Pablo Valdehuesa, whose family had entered into a compromise agreement with the Roa family in 1925. According to the defendants, the agreement was not honored, leading to the sale of the land to them in 1930. They argued that their possession was continuous and adverse, thus they had acquired ownership through this adverse possession.
    
3. **Compromise Agreement**: In 1925, there was an agreement between the Roas and Pablo Valdehuesa regarding the disputed land. The Roas were supposed to provide a replacement parcel of land or pay a sum of money to Valdehuesa. This agreement was ratified in 1927 but was allegedly not fulfilled.
    
4. **Legal Proceedings**:
    
    - **Initial Court Decision**: The Court of First Instance ruled in favor of the defendants, ordering Alfredo Roa to reconvey the land to them and to pay them for attorney’s fees.
    - **Court of Appeals**: Affirmed the lower court’s decision, ruling that the compromise agreement created an express trust. They also found that the action for reconveyance was imprescriptible and that Alfredo Roa could not invoke the indefeasibility of his Torrens title because it was obtained in breach of an express trust.
5. **Motion for Reconsideration**: The Court of Appeals denied the motion, affirming their earlier decision and indicating that the compromise agreement at least created an implied trust under the New Civil Code.
    

### **Key Legal Findings**

- The compromise agreement between the Roas and Pablo Valdehuesa created an express trust.
- The trust made it impossible for Alfredo Roa to claim indefeasibility of the title since it was obtained in violation of this trust.
- The action for reconveyance was deemed imprescriptible, meaning it could be pursued regardless of the time elapsed.


### **Summary of Decision**

1. **Compromise Agreement Binding on Alfredo Roa:**
    
    - The Court ruled that Alfredo Roa, Sr. was indeed bound by the compromise agreement despite not participating in its execution. The Court noted that Roa benefited from the agreement, which led to the successful registration of the land under the Torrens system. The Court found that it would be unjust enrichment for Roa and his successors to retain the property without fulfilling the agreed obligations.
2. **Existence of Express or Implied Trust:**
    
    - The Court disagreed with the Court of Appeals' finding that an express trust was created by the compromise agreement. It was determined that there was no clear intent to create an express trust as defined under Articles 1441 and 1444 of the New Civil Code.
    - The Court also rejected the creation of an implied trust under Article 1456 of the New Civil Code, which deals with property acquired through mistake or fraud. The Court found that the property was not acquired through mistake or fraud but through a voluntary agreement.
3. **Constructive Trust and Unjust Enrichment:**
    
    - Despite rejecting the express and implied trust claims, the Court acknowledged the general principle of constructive trusts. It recognized that a constructive trust could arise to prevent unjust enrichment, particularly where a party retains property in a manner contrary to equity and good conscience.
    - The Court invoked principles from American jurisprudence on constructive trusts, emphasizing that such trusts can address situations where property is held unfairly or contrary to the intentions of the parties involved.
4. **Prescription of the Counterclaim:**
    
    - The Court determined that the counterclaim for reconveyance was not barred by prescription. The ten-year prescriptive period for enforcing an implied trust was deemed to begin when the trust was repudiated, which in this case was when the complaint for recovery was filed in 1955. The counterclaim, therefore, was within the prescriptive period.
5. **Affirmation of Judgment:**
    
    - The Court ultimately affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which had ordered the reconveyance of the property to the defendants and the payment of attorney’s fees. This decision was based on the general principles of equity and the constructive trust doctrine, ensuring justice and fair dealing.

**Conclusion:** The Court upheld the lower court’s decision, affirming the reconveyance of the property to the defendants. It emphasized the principles of equity and constructive trust in ensuring that the property was returned to those rightfully entitled, given the circumstances surrounding the compromise agreement and the unjust enrichment that would result from non-compliance with the agreement.
