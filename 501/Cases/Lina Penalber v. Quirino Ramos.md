The dispute in this case involves two primary issues:

1. **Ugac Properties**: The petitioner, the mother of Leticia and mother-in-law of Quirino, claimed ownership of a parcel of land (Ugac properties) in Tuguegarao. She alleged that her title (TCT No. T-43373) was cancelled and replaced with a new title (TCT No. T-58043) in the names of respondent spouses Ramos based on a fraudulent Deed of Donation that she did not execute. She further contended that the spouses Ramos sold the properties to respondent Bartex, Inc. even after she had warned them and filed an adverse claim. The petitioner sought to nullify the fraudulent deed, the title issued to Ramos, the subsequent sale to Bartex, Inc., and recover damages.
    
2. **Bonifacio Property**: The petitioner also claimed ownership of a commercial property on Bonifacio Street, which she alleged was purchased by the spouses Ramos on her behalf, using funds from the hardware store managed by them. She argued that the spouses Ramos were supposed to act as trustees for this property and should reconvey it to her. The spouses Ramos denied this arrangement, claiming they paid for the property themselves and that the store management was a separate agreement.
    

The Regional Trial Court (RTC) initially ruled in favor of the petitioner on the second cause of action (Bonifacio property), declaring her the owner of the property and ordering its reconveyance. However, the RTC dismissed the first cause of action (Ugac properties) due to insufficient evidence.

The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC’s decision on the Bonifacio property, finding that the petitioner failed to establish a trust agreement and thus did not prove her claim. The petitioner’s appeal to the Supreme Court challenges this reversal, focusing on whether the trust agreement was clearly established and enforceable.

Decision:

The rationale given in the decision centers on several key points:

1. **Nature of Review**: The court highlights that a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should only address questions of law, not questions of fact. The court acknowledges that while generally only questions of law are entertained, exceptions are allowed, such as when findings are based entirely on speculation.
    
2. **Trust Definition and Requirements**: The decision outlines the technical definition of a trust, including the roles of the trustor, trustee, and beneficiary. It distinguishes between express trusts (created intentionally by parties) and implied trusts (arising by operation of law). It also cites Article 1443 of the Civil Code, which requires express trusts concerning immovable property to be in writing, not just verbally agreed upon.
    
3. **Burden of Proof**: The petitioner has the burden of proving the existence of the trust. The court emphasizes that merely pointing out weaknesses in the respondents' defense is insufficient. The petitioner must establish her claims by the preponderance of evidence.
    
4. **Verification of Evidence**: The court notes that while oral testimony regarding the trust was admitted due to lack of timely objection, the weight and credibility of such evidence are evaluated judicially. The court found the testimonies, particularly concerning the difference in inventory values, to be insufficient to conclusively prove the existence of the trust.
    
5. **Speculation and Alternative Explanations**: The court criticizes the lower court’s conclusion that the inventory difference was used to purchase the Bonifacio property. It finds this reasoning speculative, noting that other factors could explain the inventory discrepancy, such as business losses or changes in stock prices.
    
 The court affirms the Court of Appeals' decision, ruling that the petitioner did not meet her burden of proof and failed to provide conclusive evidence of the alleged express trust. Therefore, the petition is denied, and costs are awarded against the petitioner.
