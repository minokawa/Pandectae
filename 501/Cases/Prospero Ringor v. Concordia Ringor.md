The dispute in the case revolves around the rightful ownership and partition of lands previously owned by Jacobo Ringor. The controversy includes several key points:

1. **Ownership and Transfer of Land**: The lands in question were registered under Jacobo Ringor's name. After his death, his son Juan Ringor, and later his grandson Jose Ringor, were involved in the registration and transfer of these lands. The petitioners argue that Jose Ringor acquired legitimate titles to these properties through purchases and inheritance, supported by documented deeds and certificates of title.
    
2. **Claim of Express Trust**: The central issue is whether Jacobo Ringor created an express trust over his lands in favor of his grandchildren (the respondents), with Jose Ringor as the trustee. The trial court concluded that such a trust existed based on the testimony of witnesses and the ongoing management of the lands by Jose Ringor, despite the absence of a formal trust deed. The Court of Appeals upheld this finding.
    
3. **Validity of Documents and Titles**: Petitioners contend that the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in nullifying the Torrens titles issued in Jose Ringor's name. They argue that the titles, which were issued based on valid land registration and transfer documents, should not be overturned.
    
4. **Parol Evidence**: The trial court relied on oral testimonies to prove the existence of an express trust, which petitioners argue is inadmissible under Article 1443 of the Civil Code, which states that an express trust concerning immovable property must be evidenced by a written document. Petitioners claim that the use of parol evidence to establish the trust was improper.
    
5. **Prescription and Laches**: Petitioners argue that the respondents' claims are barred by prescription and laches, meaning that they have waited too long to assert their rights or that they should have acted sooner to claim their share of the lands.
    
6. **Partition and Accounting**: The trial court ordered the partition of the lands among the heirs of Juan Ringor and mandated an accounting of the income and produce from the lands, which petitioners contest.
    

In summary, the dispute involves allegations of an express trust, the validity of land titles, the admissibility of parol evidence, and issues related to prescription and laches. The petitioners seek to overturn the decisions that declared the lands as part of an intestate estate and ordered their partition among the heirs.

**Trial Court Decision**: The Regional Trial Court (RTC) ruled in favor of the respondents. The key points of its decision included:

- **Express Trust**: The RTC found that Jacobo Ringor had created an express trust over the lands in question for the benefit of his grandchildren, with Jose Ringor as the trustee. This finding was based on the actions and continuous administration of the lands by Jacobo and later by Jose, despite the lack of a formal written trust deed.
- **Invalidation of Documents**: The RTC declared that the notarial deeds of sale and the donation documents were invalid. It ruled that Jacobo continued to possess and administer the lands until his death, contrary to the documented sales and donations. Thus, it deemed the titles and deeds issued to Jose Ringor as having been fraudulently obtained.
- **Partition**: The RTC ordered the partition of the lands among Jacobo Ringor’s grandchildren, which included Genoveva, Felipa, Concordia, Agapito, Emeteria, and Espirita, in equal shares.
- **Accounting and Damages**: The RTC also ordered defendants to account for the income, produce, and rents from the lands from 1973 until the partition was completed and to pay attorney's fees.
2. **Court of Appeals Decision**: The Court of Appeals affirmed the RTC's decision, agreeing with the lower court's findings regarding the express trust and the invalidity of the deeds and titles issued in Jose Ringor's name. The appellate court upheld the order for partition and accounting.

3. **Supreme Court**: The Supreme Court, on review, primarily considered the following issues:

- **Existence of Express Trust**: Whether there was a valid express trust created by Jacobo Ringor. The Court examined the evidence and concluded that the trial and appellate courts were correct in finding that an express trust existed based on the totality of circumstances and parol evidence.
- **Admissibility of Parol Evidence**: The Court agreed that although Article 1443 of the Civil Code generally requires a written document to prove an express trust, in this case, the parol evidence was admissible. The Court reasoned that the prohibition was waived by the parties’ conduct during the trial.
- **Validity of Titles**: The Supreme Court examined the arguments related to the Torrens titles and ultimately upheld the lower courts' decisions regarding the invalidation of certain titles and deeds.
- **Prescription and Laches**: The Court also addressed the claims of prescription and laches. It found that the respondents' claims were not barred by these defenses, given the nature of the trust and the continued management of the lands.


Decision:

**Existence of an Express Trust**: The Court confirmed the lower courts' findings that Jacobo Ringor created an express trust for his grandchildren. This conclusion was based on the following factors:
    
- **Direct Acts of Ownership**: Despite the deeds of sale and donations that appeared to transfer the lands to Jose Ringor, Jacobo continued to act as if he were the owner, managing and administering the lands and sharing their income with the respondents. This behavior suggested that Jacobo's actions were consistent with maintaining a trust relationship.

- **Oral Evidence**: The Court upheld the use of oral testimony (parol evidence) to establish the existence of the trust. It noted that while trusts are often created by written instruments, an express trust can also be established through oral declarations and actions, provided there is clear evidence of intent to create such a trust.

**Validity of the Transfers**:

3. **Effect of Torrens Title**: The Court clarified that the Torrens system of land registration does not create or vest title but only confirms and records existing title. A Torrens Certificate of Title does not protect a person who holds land in trust from claims by the true beneficiaries. Thus, the Court ruled that the registration in Jose’s name did not negate the trust obligation.
    
4. **Partial Performance and Statute of Frauds**: The Court addressed concerns about the Statute of Frauds, which generally requires written evidence for trusts involving land. It found that the partial performance of the trust by Jose (e.g., giving shares of the land's produce to the respondents) overcame objections related to the oral nature of the trust agreement.
    
5. **Prescription and Laches**: The Court determined that the doctrines of prescription and laches did not bar the enforcement of the express trust. It noted that a trust could not be invalidated based on the passage of time when the trustor or trustee had not repudiated the trust.
    
The Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of the lower courts, agreeing that the lands should be treated as part of Jacobo Ringor’s estate, with Jose Ringor serving as a trustee for the benefit of the respondents. It found no reversible error in the lower courts’ findings and conclusions regarding the invalidity of the deeds and the nature of the trust.
