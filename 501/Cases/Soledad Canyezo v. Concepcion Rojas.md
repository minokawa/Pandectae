#### SOLEDAD CAAEZO, SUBSTITUTED BY WILLIAM CAAEZO AND VICTORIANO CAAEZO PETITIONERS, VS. CONCEPCION ROJAS, RESPONDENT.  
  
### **Petitioner (Soledad Cañozo):**

1. **Recovery of Property**: Soledad Cañozo claims ownership of an unregistered parcel of land situated at Higatangan, Naval, Biliran, which she asserts to have bought in 1939 from Crisogono Limpiado. She contends that although the sale was not written, she took possession of the property immediately. When she and her husband left for Mindanao in 1948, she entrusted the land to her father, Crispulo Rojas. She alleges that Concepcion Rojas, her stepmother, later took possession of the property and declared it under her husband’s name, Crispulo Rojas.
    
2. **Damages**: In addition to seeking the return of the property, Cañozo also sought damages for the loss of use and value of the land due to its wrongful possession by Concepcion Rojas.
    

### **Respondent (Concepcion Rojas):**

1. **Ownership and Possession**: Concepcion Rojas argues that her late husband, Crispulo Rojas, bought the land from Crisogono Limpiado in 1948, not Soledad Cañozo. She asserts that the tax declaration of the property in Crispulo Rojas’s name and his possession and cultivation of the property from 1948 until his death in 1978 support her claim. The property was included in Crispulo’s estate, which was administered by a special administrator, and the petitioner even received her share of the estate’s produce.
    
2. **Prescription and Laches**: Rojas contends that the claim of Soledad Cañozo is barred by prescription and laches. She argues that the petitioner delayed in filing her complaint for several years, which undermines her claim. Additionally, she points out that the property was declared in the name of Crispulo Rojas and was part of his estate, which was distributed among his heirs.
    

### **Court Decisions:**

- **Municipal Trial Court (MTC)**: Initially favored Soledad Cañozo, ruling her as the lawful owner of the property based on testimony and evidence provided, despite the lack of written documentation for the sale.
    
- **Regional Trial Court (RTC)**: Initially reversed the MTC’s decision, citing that the action had prescribed. However, upon reconsideration, it amended its decision, finding that the action had not yet prescribed and ruling in favor of Cañozo.
    
- **Court of Appeals (CA)**: Reversed the RTC’s amended decision, dismissing Cañozo’s complaint on the grounds of laches and prescription. The CA concluded that the petitioner’s delay in filing the action and the evidence supporting Crispulo Rojas’s ownership and possession of the property barred Cañozo’s claim.

DECISION:
1. **Timeliness of Filing**: The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' decision to grant an extension of time for the respondent, Concepcion Rojas, to file her petition for review. The Court found no grave abuse of discretion in this decision, noting that the CA had considered the difficulty of securing a certified copy of the RTC orders as a compelling reason for the extension.
    
2. **Prescription and Laches**: The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals' ruling that the petitioner’s action for recovery of real property was barred by prescription and laches. It was noted that the petitioner, Soledad CaAezo, delayed her claim for 49 years after her father, Crispulo Rojas, began possessing the property in 1948, and 17 years after discovering that the property was in the possession of the respondent in 1980.
    
3. **Existence of Trust**: The Court found that the petitioner failed to prove the existence of an express or resulting trust between her and her father. The burden of proving a trust was on the petitioner, and she did not provide sufficient evidence to establish such a relationship. Without proof of a trust, the Court held that the respondent’s possession of the property had matured into ownership through prescription.
    
4. **Estoppel and Laches**: The petitioner was found to be estopped from asserting her claim due to her failure to contest the inclusion of the property in the estate of her father during the probate proceedings. The doctrine of estoppel in pais applied because the petitioner had participated in the estate proceedings and accepted her share without objecting.


The Supreme Court concluded that the decisions of the Court of Appeals, dated September 7, 2000, and the resolution dated May 9, 2001, were correct and denied the petition, thereby affirming the appellate court’s decision.
