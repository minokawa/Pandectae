In essence, this dispute is about the custody of a minor child, Winston, and the contested decision to grant custody to the biological father based on procedural grounds and concerns about the father's fitness.


Winston's mother, Catherine, lived with Stolk in the United States but died shortly after giving birth to Winston in the Philippines. Winston was then left in the care of the Spouses Gabun. Stolk filed a petition for habeas corpus, seeking custody of Winston, supported by a DNA test confirming his paternity. The RTC granted custody to the Stolk, which the Spouses Gabun contested. Arguing that Stolk was unfit due to his criminal record and other concerns.

The RTC dismissed their appeal due to the late payment of docket fees, leading to the finality of its decision in favor of the respondent.
The Spouses then sought to challenge this through a Petition for Certiorari in the Court of Appeals (CA), which was dismissed for being filed out of time.

Issue:

The issue before the Court is whether the CA committed reversible error in dismissing petitioners' Petition for Certiorari on technicalities. They  argue:

Improper Service of the Order - that the RTC committed a grave abuse of discretion by considering the service of its November 4, 2014 Order to petitioner Nora Lopez on November 14, 2014, as valid. That according to the Rules of Court, the Order should have been served on their counsel of record, not directly to Nora.

A Request for Leniency on Procedural Lapses - that any procedural errors they may have committed should be excused in the interest of justice, particularly given the substantive issues at stake in the case.

The Substantive Concerns Regarding Custody - that the RTC ignored crucial evidence indicating that Stolk had legal issues with authorities in both the United States and Suriname, including being a convicted felon for the unlawful transport of firearms. These legal issues should have led the RTC to order a case study by the DSWD as required under the Rule on Custody of Minors and the Family Code. Emphasizing the best interest of the child.

Decision:

The petition is deemed meritorious, leading to a ruling in favor of the petitioners. The Supreme Court found that the RTC committed a grave abuse of discretion by dismissing the petitioners' Notice of Appeal due to alleged failure to pay docket and lawful fees within the prescribed period. 

The CA also committed a reversible error by not relaxing procedural rules to address these jurisdictional errors, especially considering the best interest of the minor, Winston. 

The Supreme Court emphasized that in matters involving custody of minors, the paramount consideration should be their best interests, and technicalities should be set aside to achieve substantial justice.

As to the law concerning the minor the court relied on the follwing.

Doctrine of Parens Patriae, the state has the inherent right and duty to minimize harm to minors, who are not fully capable of caring for themselves.

Article 363 of the Civil Code, prior to the adoption of the Family Code, this article mandated that in all questions relating to the care, custody, education, and property of children, their welfare must be the paramount consideration.

Article 176 of the Family Code, grants sole parental authority over illegitimate children to the mother, even if the child is recognized by the father. Articles 214 and 216, address substitute parental authority in cases where the parents are absent, deceased, or unsuitable.

On procedural issues, the rule on Custody of Minors, mandates that in awarding custody, the court should prioritize the best interests of the minor. The 15-day appeal period provided under this rule was determined to be applicable in this case. Rule 13, Section 2 stipulates that if a party is represented by counsel, service of court orders should be made upon the counsel unless otherwise ordered by the court. Rule 41, Section 4 specifies that the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees must be paid within the period for taking an appeal.
