Moreover, should there be any existing case filed by the Respondents-Appellees against the Petitioners-Appellants arising out of the same facts as the above-captioned case, Respondents-Appellees hereby undertake to immediately cause the dismissal thereof with prejudice to the filing of any other suit against the Petitioners-Appellants;

  

"5. Petitioners-Appellees (sic) likewise agree not to institute their intended Petition for Review on Certiorari (With Application for the Issuance of Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction) with the Supreme Court and agree to cause the dismissal of all their counter-claims against Respondents-Appellees in the above-entitled case with prejudice;

  

"6. The terms and conditions heretofore voluntarily set forth by the parties are not contrary to law."
