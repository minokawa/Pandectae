The Facts

  

From 2017 to 2018, there was ongoing litigation between the InnodataEmployees Association (IDEA) and Innodata, Inc. (Innodata) before theNational Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) concerning the bid forInnodata' s trademark and its corresponding monetary award.1Complainant Gabuat is a member of IDEA.2 Respondent Atty.Dominguez is the legal counsel ofINODEES104, the 104 judgment creditorswho participated in the bidding for Innodata's trademark.

  

On 18 November 2018, Atty. Dominguez came uninvited to an IDEAmeeting and Christmas party held at Malibay Plaza, Pasay City, where Gabuatwas present.4 At the event, there was a heated discussion between Atty.Dominguez and the IDEA officers and members about the issues arising fromthe bid for Innodata's trademark.5 Atty. Dominguez referred to Gabuat as "tanga" and "nagtatanga-tangahan," called Joemarie Deles (Deles), IDEAPresident, derogatory terms such as "bakla," "hipocrito" and "sinungaling,"pointed his finger while talking back at others, and spoke in a loud andaggressive manner in the presence of the meeting's attendees.6

  

Following the incident, on 24 November 2018, Gabuat filed acomplaint with the Office of the Bar Confidant on the ground that Atty.Dominguez displayed behavior unbecoming of a lawyer. 7

  

On 4 February 2019, the Court issued a Resolution requiring Atty.Dominguez to file a Comment within ten days from notice.

  

On 9 May 2019, Atty. Dominguez filed a Motion for Extension and toSecure Copy of Video.9 On 17 July 2019, the Court issued a Resolutiongranting Atty. Dominguez's Motion, giving him an additional 15 days aftersecuring a copy of the video within which to file a Comment. 10

  

On 22 January 2020, the Court issued a Resolution noting Gabuat'supdated Manifestation submitting a copy of the video saved in the flash driveas additional proof of the incident subject of her complaint. 11

  

On 11 March 2020, the Court issued a Resolution reqmnng Atty.Dominguez to (1) show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt withor held in contempt for his failure to file a Comment, and (2) comply with the4 February 2019 Resolution which directed him to file a Comment on thecomplaint.

  

On 20 August 2020, Atty. Dominguez filed his Manifestation andMotion for Extension of Time to File Comment and to Secure Copy ofVideo.13 In an attempt to contextualize the incident, Atty. Dominguezmentions Deles' "fraudulent bid," authorized by Atty. Cezar Maravilla, Jr.(Atty. Maravilla), legal counsel of Innodata, about the acquisition of theInnodata trademark. Moreover, Atty. Dominguez also attached as an Annex acopy of a Motion he filed in the labor case between IDEA and Innodata beforetheNLRC.1

  

On 23 November 2020, the Court issued a Resolution noting Atty.Dominguez's Manifestation and Motion for Extension of Time to FileComment and to Secure Copy of Video. 15 However, to this date, Atty.Dominguez has not complied with the directive to submit a Comment.

  

The Issue

  

Did Atty. Dominguez display conduct unbecoming of a lawyer and violate the Code of Professional Responsibility?

  

The Ruling of the Court

  

This Court finds that Atty. Dominguez is guilty of conduct unbecoming of a lawyer, in violation of Canons 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

  

The practice of law is a privilege bestowed upon those who show thatthey possess, and continue to possess, the qualifications required by law forthe conferment of the same. 16 It is for this reason that members of the legalprofession are held to the most exacting standards, both in their professionaland personal lives.

  

Good moral character is not only a condition precedent, but also acontinuing requirement for one to remain a lawyer in good standing in thelegal profession. 17 In Abragan v. Rodriguez, 18 the Court ruled that the CPRestablishes the norms of conduct and ethical standards in the legal profession,and that the Court must not shirk from its duty to ensure that all lawyers liveup to its provisions. Moreover, in Buenviaje v. Magdamo, 19 it was ruled thatany violation of these conditions exposes the lawyer to administrativeliability.

  

A review of the record will show that Atty. Dominguez's actionsamount to conduct unbecoming of a lawyer, and that he violated severalprovisions of the CPR.

  

As captured in the video footage of the incident, as well as in Gabuat'saffidavit, it is evident how Atty. Dominguez conducted himself in a mannerunbecoming of a lawyer. Not only did he interrupt a private event he was not invited to, his overall disposition while interacting with the IDEA officers and members was intimidating and aggressive, if not downright insulting anddemeaning.

  

While at the event, Atty. Dominguez raised his voice, spoke in aprovocative and condescending tone, and pointed his finger in an aggressivemanner while in conversation with the IDEA officers and members, includingcomplainant Gabuat, whom he called "tanga." To add insult to injury, hemade disparaging comments against Deles, the IDEA President, such as"hipocrito" and "sinungaling," and referred to him as "bakla," a homophobicslur, a degrading and discriminatory gender insensitive stereotype.

  

It was inevitable for a conflict to arise, given the contentious topic ofthe discussion that led to the volatile exchanges between Atty. Dominguezand the IDEA officers and members. However, a lawyer is expected to remaincivil and respectful, and to use temperate language in such a way that is inkeeping with the dignity of the profession.

  

Atty. Dominguez's hostile behavior and offensive utterances towardsthe IDEA officers and members warrant discipline by this Court, as they arein flagrant violation of Canons 7 and 8 of the CPR, which state:

  

Canon 7: A lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity anddignity of the legal profession and support the activities of the integratedbar.

  

Rule 7.03: A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adverselyreflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public orprivate life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legalprofession.

  

Rule 8.01: A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, uselanguage which is abusive, offensive, or otherwise improper.

  

Worse, when directed by the Court to show cause as to why he shouldnot be disciplinarily sanctioned, Atty. Dominguez, in his Motion, tried tojustify his actions by imputing malice on Atty. Maravilla in calling the bid heauthorized Deles to make as "fraudulent."20 Though a lawyer is expected torepresent his client's cause with passion, such must not to be to the point ofmaking malicious and unsupported accusations against opposing counsel. InNava II v. Artuz,21 citing Noble III v. Ailes,22 it was ruled that ''the hurling ofinsulting language against opposing counsel 1s considered conductunbecoming of the legal profession."

  

Clearly, Atty. Dominguez's remark against opposing counsel Atty.Maravilla in his Motion defies the express mandates of Canon 8 and 19 of theCPR, which state:

  

Canon 8: A lawyer shall conduct himself with courtesy, fairness,and candor towards his professional colleagues, and shall avoid harassingtactics against opposing counsel.

  

Rule 8.01: A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, uselanguage which is abusive, offensive, or otherwise improper.

  

Canon 19: A lawyer must represent his client with zeal within thebounds of the law.

  

Furthermore, Atty. Dominguez failed to comply with the directive tosubmit a Comment despite filing two Motions for Extension for this purpose,which were both granted by the Court. The Court gave Atty. Dominguezseveral opportunities to secure the video, as well as adequate time to preparea Comment, for the purpose of refuting the allegations made in the complaintagainst him. However, considering that two years have passed without theCourt receiving his Comment, it can be deduced that there was no intentionon his part to submit one at all.

  

The present case has evaded resolution due to the delay caused by thenon-submission of the Comment, to the prejudice of both the complainant andthe Court. Indeed, Atty. Dominguez's failure to comply with the directive tofile a Comment, despite deliberately asking for and being granted multipleextensions, is inexcusable and must be penalized. This demonstrates wantondisregard of the Court's authority, in blatant contravention of Canons 1, 10,11, and 12 of the CPR, which state that:

  

Canon 1: A lawyer shall uphold the constitution, obey the laws ofthe land and promote respect for law and legal processes.

  

Rule 1.01: A lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest,immoral or deceitful conduct.

  

Canon 10: A lawyer owes candor, fairness, and good faith to thecourt.

  

Rule 10.03: A lawyer shall observe the rules of procedure and shallnot misuse them to defeat the ends of justice.

  

Canon 11: A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due tothe courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct byothers.

  

Canon 12: A lawyer shall exert every effort and consider it his dutyto assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice.

  

Rule 12.03: A lawyer shall not, after obtaining extensions of timeto file pleadings, memoranda or briefs, let the period lapse withoutsubmitting the same or offering an explanation for his failure to do so.

  

Rule 12.04: A lawyer shall not unduly delay a case, impede theexecution of a judgment, or misuse Court processes.

  

For the purpose of determining the appropriate penalty to be imposedon an erring lawyer, previous infractions must also be taken intoconsideration. In Tabujara v. Aristotle T. Dominguez,23 Atty. Dominguez waspreviously admonished by this Court "to be more careful in his dealings in thefuture and avoid any suspicion of impropriety on his part."

  

To conclude, the Court is convinced that Atty. Dominguez displayedconduct unbecoming of a lawyer and violated several provisions of the CPRwhen he used derogatory and abusive language and behaved in a threateningmanner towards the IDEA officers and members at the event where he arriveduninvited. This is further aggravated by his non-compliance with the directiveto file a Comment despite asking for and being granted two Motions forExtension, as well as his malicious imputation of fraud on opposing counsel.It must also be noted that Atty. Dominguez had already been previouslyadmonished by this Court, and that this is the second administrative chargefiled against him.

  

Thus, the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period ofone (1) year is an appropriate sanction to be meted out on Atty. Dominguezfor his display of conduct unbecoming of a lawyer and for his multipleviolations of the CPR, taking into account the aggravating circumstance of hisprevious conviction and his deliberate securing of extensions, without,however, making the required submissions in defiance of the authority of theCourt.

  

WHEREFORE, the Court finds respondent Atty. Aristotle T.Dominguez GUILTY of violating Canons 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 19 of theCode of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, the Court SUSPENDS himfrom the practice of law for a period of one (1) year.

  

Respondent is DIRECTED to report to this Court the date of his receiptof this Resolution to enable it to determine when his suspension from thepractice of law shall take effect.

  

Let copies of this Resolution be furnished to: (1) the Office of the BarConfidant to be appended to respondent's personal record as an attorney; (2)the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and (3)the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in thecountry.

  

SO ORDERED."

  

By authority of the Court:
