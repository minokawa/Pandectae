vs
Atty. Wilfredo A. Ruiz
Atty. Cherry Anne Dela Cruz
Atty. Francisco S. Benedicto III


This is  a disbarment complaint by Teodora Altobano-Ruiz against her estranged husband - Atty. Wilfredo A. Ruiz. In which she also alleged case mishandling by her own counsel and harassment by her husband's.

Teodora sued her husband, Atty. Wilfredo A. Ruiz, for violations of Republic Act (RA) 9262 (Anti-VAWC Act) and applied for a Permanent Protection Order which is granted by the Pasig RTC. Despite the PPO, Atty. Ruiz failed to provide financial support for Teodora and their children, and so a writ of execution was issued to enforce it. However, Ruiz continued to withhold support.  

Facing an unenforced PPO, the delay of her estafa case, and an adultery charge. Teodora accused her own counsel, Atty. Dela Cruz, of mishandling her cases; and Atty. Benedicto, her husbands counsel, of harassment. Teodora submitted  documents, court decisions, and orders to support her allegations. Along with Ruiz' MAU with his mistress, allegedly made to hide earnings. 

The Integrated Bar of the Philippines - Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) acted on the allegations and found the following.


On Atty. Ruiz. He failed to provide support to Teodora and their minor child despite the trial court’s final and executory judgment and orders in the Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children case. Was found to have abandoned his family and cohabited with another woman, which was viewed as misconduct. The IBP-CBD concluded that Atty. Ruiz engaged in unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct. Therefore, they recommended his disbarment.

On Atty. Dela Cruz. The complaint against her is dismissed for lack of merit. It was found that the allegations  were baseless and that she had not mishandled Teodora's cases in the manner described.

On Atty. Benedicto. The complaint was also dismissed for lack of merit. The IBP-CBD did not find sufficient grounds to hold him administratively liable for any violations of the CPR.

Issues:

Atty. Ruiz committed economic abuse, emotional abuse, and gross immorality by failing to provide support to his child despite court orders and engaging in an illicit relationship. He also exploited court processes, engaged in deceitful and dishonest conduct, and unduly delayed the case, thereby violating multiple rules of the CPR.

The responsibility and conduct of Atty. Cherry Anne Dela Cruz and Atty. Francisco S. Benedicto, and whether they ere involved in any wrongdoing or conspiracy with Atty. Ruiz.

Decision:

The Supreme Court upheld the recommendation for Atty. Ruiz’s disbarment due to his serious violations of professional conduct. 

Dismissing the claims against Atty. Dela Cruz and Atty. Benedicto for lack of evidence. The Court's ratio is focused on the serious nature of Ruiz's conduct, which not only violated professional ethics but also demonstrated a profound disregard for legal and familial responsibilities. 

Ruiz’s refusal to provide support to his child, despite clear court orders, constituted economic abuse and gross immorality. His actions violated Rules 1.01 - prohibition against unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct, and 7.03 - conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice law.

His actions were seen as deceitful and aimed at obstructing justice. The repeated use of false addresses to avoid court processes and delay the execution of judgments violated Rules 10.01 - prohibition against falsehoods in court, and 10.03 - observance of procedural rules and not misusing them of the CPR. And entering into an illegal agreement with his mistress to avoid financial obligations to his child, violated Rule 12.04 - prohibition against undue delay and misuse of court processes.
