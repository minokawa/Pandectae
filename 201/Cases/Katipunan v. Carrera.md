A complaint was filed by Benjamin M. Katipunan, Jr. against his lawyer, Atty. Rebene C. Carrera, for alleged violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), Canons of Professional Ethics, the Lawyer's Oath, and the Revised Rules of Court. The central issue is whether Atty. Carrera was negligent in handling Katipunan's case, specifically whether he failed to exercise the required diligence and failed to keep his client informed about important developments in the case.

The key details of the complaint are as follows:

Failure to Inform About Case Status - The complainant claimed that after filing the petition for review, Atty. Carrera did not provide any updates on the status of the case, despite being aware of its denial as early as February 25, 2010.
Misrepresentation of the Case Status:

The complainant made two follow-up requests for information on the case, first in March 2010 and then in May 2010. In both instances, Atty. Carrera falsely assured the complainant that the case was still pending, even though he knew it had already been denied.

Negligence in Legal Duty -Atty. Carrera failed to file a motion for reconsideration following the denial of the petition. He did not inform the complainant of this crucial development, thereby depriving the complainant of the opportunity to seek other legal remedies.


Resulting Harm to the Complainan - Due to Atty. Carrera's failure to inform the complainant and his subsequent inaction, the complainant lost the opportunity to challenge the denial of his petition, which could have potentially altered the outcome of his legal matter.

Issues:
Failure to Inform: Atty. Carrera allegedly failed to inform Katipunan promptly about the Supreme Court's resolution denying his petition, which could have allowed Katipunan to take further legal action, such as filing a motion for reconsideration.

Decision:

The Supreme Court found Atty. Rebene C. Carrera guilty of violating the Lawyer's Oath, Canon 18, Rule 18.03, and Rule 18.04 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR), as well as Canon 15 of the Canons of Professional Ethics. Atty. Carrera was suspended from the practice of law for one (1) month, with a stern warning that any repetition of the same or similar act would be dealt with more severely.
