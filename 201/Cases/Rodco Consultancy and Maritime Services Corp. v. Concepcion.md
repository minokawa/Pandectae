Rodco Consultancy and Maritime Services Corp. v. Concepcion

This is a complaint filed by RODCO Consultancy and Maritime Services Corporation (RODCO) against Atty. Concepcion, that includes allegations of unethical and deceitful conduct.

Concepcion was contracted by RODCO to provide legal services to its clients. He allegedly solicited money in seperate cases from RODCO and its clients for representation, early settlement, and favorable rulings. He also did not provide an accounting for the funds, and did not return them when requested. Concepcion also implied that he could influence the outcome of cases due to his connections, this includes suggesting to a client that he could influence his Labor Arbiter wife to secure a favorable ruling.  RODCO added conflict of interest to the allegations, as Concepcion's law firm represented clients in cases against them after their contractual relationship was terminated. He is accused of persuading RODCOâ€™s clients to withdraw consultancy contracts and to be his direct clients. 

The IBP concluded that Concepcion misappropriated the funds entrusted to him. Despite being given money for specific purposes, he failed to provide proper accounting and did not return the funds as requested. There is evidence supporting the allegation of influence peddling and attempting to leverage his connections to secure favorable outcome. His involvement in cases with conflicting interests is also deemed to be a breach of professional ethics and standards. Concepcion's overall unethical behavior, deceitful practices and failure to uphold the dignity of the legal profession resulted to a recommendation for disciplinary action - suspension or disbarment.

Issues:

The court must determine the nature and extent of Atty. Concepcion's misconduct and the appropriate disciplinary action to impose.

Decision:

The Court's decision is disbarment. The Court found that Concepcion committed serious misconduct, including misappropriation of funds and influence peddling, which warranted the most severe penalty to uphold the integrity of the legal profession.

Handling client funds is a matter of trust. By failing to return the funds, Concepcion breached that trust, which is fundamental to the lawyer-client relationship. 

Failing to fully disclose the conflict of interest to his clients means he did not obtain their informed consent. A failure that deprives his clients of the opportunity to make an informed decision. Citing Atty. Cagampang vs. Atty. Reusora and Guevara vs. Guevara, the court discussed the implications of such misconduct and gives insight into how the Court handles cases involving ethical breaches.

Influence peddling has a considered the broader impact on the legal profession. Such conduct can harm clients by potentially leading to unfair outcomes and can tarnish the reputation of the legal profession and not just harm the client. It creates an environment where legal outcomes can be swayed by inappropriate or unethical means, rather than being based on merit and justice.  Concepcion's actions breached this fundamental ethical principle.
