Please take notice that the Court, Second Division, issued a Resolution dated July 18, 2022 which reads as follows:

"A.C. No.13236 (Formerly CBD Case No.17-5505) In Re: CA-G.R. CR No. 39115 (People of the Philippines v. Patrick B. Santos) v. Atty. Von Ronald Supeiia*. - The Court NOTES the Notices of Resolution dated October 12, 2019 1 and March 13, 2021 2 passed by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) Board of Governors approving and adopting its Investigating Commissioner's Report and Recommendation3 dated April 15, 2019, recommending Atty. Von Ronald Supefia's (Atty. Supena) suspension from the practice of law for two years for gross negligence.

  

Patrick B. Santos (Santos) was charged with estafa under paragraphs l(b) and 2(a), Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).4 During arraignment, Santos pleaded not guilty to both charges. 5 The Regional Trial Court of Calamba, Branch 35 (RTC) referred the cases to the Philippine Mediation Center, where the private complainant and Santos reached an amicable settlement over the civil aspect of the case.6 On December 9, 2014, the RTC disapproved the compromise agreement for failure of Atty. Supefi.a, the defense counsel, to attend the hearing for its approval.7 Thereafter, trial ensued.8

  

After the prosecution presented its evidence, the RTC set the presentation of the defense's evidence on October 19, 2015. 9 On that date, Atty. Supefia failed to appear. 10 The RTC reset the hearing to November 16, 2015, warning that failure of the defense to present evidence on the next scheduled hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the accused's right to present his evidence. 11 Despite the warning, Atty. Supefia still failed to appear on November 16, 2015. 12 Thus, the RTC declared that Santos waived his right to present evidence in his defense and ordered the case to be submitted for decision. 13 In its Decision dated February 22, 2016, the RTC found Santos guilty of estafa under paragraph 1 (b ), Article 315 of the RPC, but acquitted him of the same crime under paragraph 2(a) thereof. 14 The RTC based its finding of guilt on Santos' failure to present countervailing evidence, thus: 

> Despite several opportunities, accused failed to present and adduce evidence for his defense. On 16 November 20 15, accused again failed to adduce evidence for his defense despite a previous warning issued by this Court. Thus, the accused was deemed to have waived the right to present evidence for his defense. The records will show that accused did not even file a motion for reconsideration from the Order of this Court declaring him to have waived the right to present evidence for his defense. 15

Aggrieved, Santos appealed to the Comi of Appeals (CA), which set aside the RTC ruling in its Decision 16 dated October 26, 2017. The CA declared that while as a rule, clients are bound by their counsels' negligence, the rule does not apply where the counsel's reckless or gross negligence deprives the client of due process of law, among others. 17 The CA found Atty. Supefia guilty of gross negligence because h.is omissions - his failure to appear during several hearings leading to a waiver of Santos' right to present evidence - amounted to an abandonment or total disregard of Santos' case. 18 It remanded the case to the RTC, so Santos could present evidence in his defense. 19 It also ordered that a copy of its Decision be furnished to the IBPCommission on Bar Discipline ( CED) for appropriate administrative action against Atty. Supefia.20 Before the IBP-CBD, the case was docketed as CBD Case No. 17-5505.

Accordingly, the IBP-CBD ordered Atty. Supefia to file a verified answer within 15 days from receipt of the notice. 21 After five motions for extension of time to file answer,22 Atty. Supefia filed his Answer23 on April 11, 2018. The IBP-CBD issued a Notice of Mandatory Conference,24 setting the mandatory conference of the case on December 7, 2018 and directing the parties to submit their briefs three days before the scheduled date. 

On December 11, 2018, Atty. Supefia filed his Mandatory Conference Brief.25 During the mandatory conference, the IBP-CBD issued an Order26 dated December 7, 2018, directing Atty. Supefia to file a verified position paper within 30 days from receipt. Again, after several motions for extension of time to file his verified Position Paper,27 Atty. Supefia filed his Position Paper28 on March 21, 2019.

In his Position Paper, Atty. Supefia alleged that he only entered his appearance on March 13, 2014,29 while Santos and the private complainant entered into a compromise agreement30 way before his entry or on November 6, 2012. The RTC set this first compromise agreement aside upon the private prosecutor's motion that Santos had no intention to be bound thereby.31

When Santos secured Atty. Supefia's services, Santos never told Atty. Supefia his side of the story. Since Santos insisted on settling the case, Atty. Supefia filed a Motion to Set Case for Judicial Dispute Resolution (JDR) on April 30, 2014.32 The RTC did not set the case for JDR, but it ordered the submission of the parties' second compromise agreement on December 8, 2014.33 On the said date, Atty. Supefia and Santos failed to appear due to Typhoon Ruby, which struck and affected the Laguna area on December 8 and 9, 2014. Atty. Supefia was also confused about the date of the hearing because the RTC's Order set it on December 8, 2014, but the RTC held the hearing on December 9, 2014. On December 9, 2014, the RTC issued a Warrant of Arrest against Santos.34 Atty. Supefia filed a Motion for Reconsideration (to Lift Warrant of Arrest and the Fine Imposed),35 which the RTC denied. Atty. Supefia filed another Urgent Motion for Reconsideration (for the Denial of the Motion for Reconsideration to Lift Warrant of Arrest and the Fine Imposed). 

Atty. Supefia claimed that Santos was uncooperative and failed to answer calls and text messages. He even had to contact Santos' estranged wife and brother. 37 Due to the lack of communication between him and Santos, Atty. Supefia assumed that Santos had already terminated his services. Consequently, he did not attend the hearings on October 19, 2015 for the initial presentation of the defense's witness and on November 16, 2015.

Eventually, Santos begged Atty. Supefia to appear again as Santos' counsel. Atty. Supefia acceded, but he did not see any reason to move for the reconsideration of the RTC Order waiving the presentation of accused's evidence. On February 22, 2016, or the date of promulgation of judgment, Atty. Supefia was confident that the court will acquit Santos. Atty. Supefia and Santos, however, arrived late. When they arrived in court, the RTC already issued an Order for Santos' an-est. Hence, Atty. Supefia filed an Urgent Motion for Reconsideration (to Lift Arrest Order/Warrant of Arrest), 38 which the RTC granted. 39 On the rescheduled promulgation of judgment, the RTC found Santos guilty of one out of the two charges against him. Thereafter, Atty. Supefia filed a Notice of Appea!40 and an Urgent Application for Bail Pending Appeal,4 1 which the RTC denied.

In sum, Atty. Supefia insisted that he was not negligent and did not fail to fight for the cause of his uncooperative client. Otherwise, he would not have: (1) tried to contact Santos; (2) informed Santos' estranged wife and brother of Santos' failure to communicate with him; and (3) filed the Notice of Appeal and the Urgent Application for Bail Pending Appeal.

In its Report and Recommendation42 dated April 15, 2019, the IBPCBD recommended that Atty. Supefia be suspended from the practice of law for two years for gross negligence. The IBP-CBD found Atty. Supefia guilty of violating Rule 18.03, Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) by failing to appear on behalf of his client during several hearings. Even after the RTC declared Santos to have waived his right to present evidence, Atty. Supefia did not take steps to set the order aside. The IBP-CBD concluded that Atty. Supefia' s omissions amounted to an abandonment or total disregard of Santos' case. His repeated absences showed a conscious indifference and utter disregard for Santos' cause. The IBP-CBD emphasized that Atty. Supefia's duty to his client did not automatically cease even when Santos did not communicate with him. Atty. Supefia's failure to present evidence in Santos' defense constituted gross negligence.

On October 12, 2019, the IBP Board of Governors passed a Resolution43 approving and adopting the IBP-CBD's Report and Recommendation. Atty. Supefia moved for reconsideration,44 which was denied in a Resolution45 dated March 13, 2021 .


The sole issue before this Court is whether Atty. Supefia should be punished for gross negligence and meted with the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for two years.

This Court adopts the IBP Board of Governors' recommendation.

Atty. Supefia is guilty of gross negligence. He violated the Lawyer's Oath and Canons 17, 18, and 19 of the CPR.

The Lawyer's Oath "mandates every lawyer to conduct himself/herself according to the best of his/her knowledge and discretion, with all good fidelity as well to the courts as to his/her clients."46 Meanwhile, Chapter IV of the CPR provides every lawyer's relationship with his/her clients. Canons 17, 18, Rule 18.03, and Canon 19 provide:

> CANON 17 -A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and he shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him. 
> 
> CANON 18 - A lawyer shall serve his client with competence and diligence.
> 
> RULE 18.03 A lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection therewith shall render him liable. xxxx
> 
> CANON 19 - A lawyer shall represent his client with zeal within the bounds of the law.

Atty. Supefia admitted that he did not attend the hearing on October 19, 2015 on the assumption that Santos had already terminated his services. Even after receiving a warning that the presentation of the defense's evidence will be deemed waived if the defense fails to present evidence during the next hearing, Atty. Supefia still did not attend the hearing on November 16, 2015. As a result, the RTC declared that Santos had already waived his right to present evidence in his defense. Section 26, Rule 13 8 of the Rules of Court dictates the procedure to terminate a lawyer's services as counsel:

> Section 26. Change of attorneys. - An attorney may retire at any time from any action or special proceeding, by the written consent of his client filed in court. He may also retire at any time from an action or special proceeding, without the consent of his client, should the court, on notice to the client and attorney, and on hearing, determine that he ought to be allowed to retire. In case of substitution, the name of the attorney newly employed shall be entered on the docket of the court in place of the former one, and written notice of the change shall be given to the advance party. A client may at any time dismiss his attorney or substitute another in his place, but if the contract between client and attorney has been reduced to writing and the dismissal of the attorney was without justifiable cause, he shall be entitled to recover from the client the full compensation stipulated in the contract. However, the attorney may, in the discretion of the court; intervene in the case to protect his rights. For the payment of his compensation[,] the attorney shall have a lien upon all judgments for the payment of money, and executions issued in pursuance of such judgment, rendered in the case wherein his services had been retained by the client.

In Katipunan, Jr. v. Atty. Carrera,47 this Court declared that, without complying with Section 26, the attorney of record remains as client's counsel. This goes without saying that such counsel is still required to exert "utmost learning and ability," without withholding anything from their client. Hence: 

> Without complying with Sec. 26, the attorney ofrecord for one party remains his or her counsel on whom notices should be served. For its part, the Court may recognize no other representation on behalf of the client except such counsel of record until a formal substitution of attorney is effected. Until then, the lawyer of record is deemed continuously required to exert "utmost learning and ability" to the end that nothing shall be taken away or be withheld from his or her clients, save by the rules oflaw pursuant to Canon 15 of the Code of Professional Ethics:

> Canon 15. How far a lawyer may go in supporting a client's cause.
> 
> Nothing operates more certainly to create or to foster popular prejudice against lawyers as a class, and to deprive the profession of that full measure of public esteem and confidence which belongs to the proper discharge of its duties than does the false claim often set up by the unscrupulous for the defense of questionable transactions, that it is the duty of the lawyer to do whatever may enable him to succeed in winning his client's cause. 
> 
> It is improper for a lawyer to assert in argument his personal belief in his client's innocence or in the justice of his cause.
> 
> The lawyer owes "entire devotion to the interest of the client, warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability," to the end that nothing be taken or be withheld from him, save by the rules of law, legally applied. No fear of judicial disfavor or public popularity should restrain him from the full discharge of his duty. In the judicial forum[,] the client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy and defense that is authorized by the law of the land, and he may expect his lawyer to assert every such remedy or defense. But it is steadfastly to be borne in mind that the great trust of the lawyer is to be performed within and not without the bounds of the law. The office of attorney does not permit, much less does it demand of him for any client, violation oflaw or any manner of fraud or chicanery. He must obey his own conscience and not that of his client. (Emphasis supplied)48

To be sure, Atty. Supefia was not justified in assuming that Santos had terminated his services. Without either of them complying with Section 26, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, Atty. Supefia remained as Santos' counsel of record, owing every ounce of zeal and devotion, and from whom the latter deserved utmost learning and ability. "Until the lawyer's withdrawal is properly done, the lawyer is expected to do his or her best for the interest of the client.

To make matters worse, Atty. Supefia failed to move for the reconsideration of the RTC Order waiving the presentation of Santos' defense because Atty. Supefia "did not see any reason"50 to do so. Needless to say, "a lawyer is not in the position to rule on the merits of his or her complainant's case. Neither can a lawyer unilaterally decide whether to forego the very last remedy available to his or her client."

In Mitchell v. Atty. Amistoso,52 the respondent lawyer accepted the complainant's annulment case for a fee of P650,000.00. During the pendency of the case, the lawyer made several cash advances totaling P800,000.00. Despite that, however, the lawyer failed to attend hearings and communicate with the client. In imposing a penalty of suspension from the practice of the law for three (3) years, this Court ruled that, while lawyers are not obliged to advocate for every person who wishes to become their client, once lawyers agree to take up the cause of their client, "lawyers owe fidelity to such cause and must be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in them." In other words, lawyers are obliged to fight for such cause until the end, save for when their services are validly terminated. Therefore:
> 
> It must be stressed that no lawyer is obliged to advocate for every person who may wish to become his client, but once he agrees to take up the cause of his client, the lawyer owes fidelity to such cause and must be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him. Among the fundamental rules of ethics is the principle that an attorney who undertakes an action impliedly stipulates to carry it to its termination, that is, until the case becomes final and executory. A lawyer is not at liberty to abandon his client and withdraw his services without any reasonable cause and only upon notice appropriate in the circumstances. Any dereliction of duty by a counsel affects the client.
> 
> Canon 18, Rule 18.03 requires that a lawyer "shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in connection [therewith] shall render him liable." What amounts to carelessness or negligence in a lawyer's discharge of his duty to his client is incapable of an exact formulation, but the Court has consistently held that the mere failure of a lawyer to perfo1111 the obligations due his client is per se a violation. Thus, by mere failing to attend comi hearings with justifiable reasons, and simply vanishing in thin air, Atty. Amistoso was remiss in the discharge of his responsibility. He, thus, violated the Code of Professional Responsibility.

It bears noting that in the present case, Atty. Supefia did not only fail to attend an ordinary hearing; he also failed to attend two hearings for the presentation of the defense's evidence. More importantly, he did not fail to attend these hearings for some justification outside of his control, but he consciously chose not to attend. It should be noted that the RTC found Santos guilty of estafa under paragraph 1 (b ), Article 315 of the RPC for failing to present countervailing evidence. Without a doubt, the RTC's guilty verdict could be traced back to Atty. Supefia's failure to present and adduce evidence on Santos' behalf. To the mind of this Court, there is no greater injustice than to be prejudiced by, and be at the mercy of, one's counsel, upon whom a client has bestowed full trust and confidence.

By being deliberately absent during two crucial hearings and audaciously allowing the time for the filing of a motion for reconsideration to lapse, Atty. Supefia undoubtedly violated the zeal and fidelity owed to Santos' cause. Atty. Supefia deserted the trust and confidence reposed in him by Santos and failed to serve Santos with competence and diligence. Santos entrusted Atty. Supefia with the former's criminal case - a case that could potentially deprive him of his liberty - yet Atty. Supefia neglected the handling thereof. Consequently, Atty. Supefia should be held liable for his negligence.

  

This Court is mindful of Atty. Supefia's misplaced confidence. Atty. Supefia noted that "on February 22, 2016 or on the date of promulgation of judgment, the undersigned [r]espondent was confident that the court will acquit accused-appellant Santos."54 It is not, however, for Atty. Supefia to speculate on the outcome of the case. A lawyer's responsibility is to defend his or her client's cause with unyielding faithfulness and prudence, and not to engage in speculations that may even jeopardize the quality of a lawyer's engagement. In fact, Atty. Supefia's confidence may have been the reason why he arrived late during the promulgation of judgment, which led the RTC to issue an order for Santos' arrest.

Clearly, Atty. Supefia's acts can no longer be considered as mere laxities, which this Court can tolerate. While Atty. Supefia cited acts to impress upon this Court that he fought for Santos' cause, these acts do not erase the fact that he committed negligence. Indeed, acts of seeming care or prudence do not negate acts done in wanton disregard of such care.

  

Mitchell enunciates that a member of the bar may either be disbarred or suspended for violation of the Lawyer's Oath and/or for breach of the CPR. 55 As earlier discussed, this Court, in Mitchell, imposed a penalty of suspension from the practice of law for three (3) years upon the erring lawyer.

Similarly, this Court, in Portuguese, Jr. v. Centro,56 imposed a penalty of suspension from the practice of law for three (3) years upon the lawyer who "casually set aside a legal matter entrusted to him and which deserved his full attention and diligence."57 There, the lawyer failed to (1) file a memorandum and misrepresented about filing it, (2) inform the client of the RTC Decision, and (3) protect the client's interest against the adverse RTC Decision, among others.

  

In Nonato v. Fudolin, Jr., 58 the lawyer therein failed to inform the complainant of the status of the case and file a position paper for his client despite notice from the lower court requiring him to do so. This led to the dismissal of the complainant's ejectment suit. For greatly prejudicing his client's cause, this Court imposed upon the lawyer a penalty of two-year suspension from the practice of law.

On the other hand, this Court, in Sousa v. Tinampay, 59 meted upon a lawyer the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for one year. The lawyer therein neglected to represent the complainant during the pre-trial of the case, leading to the complainant being declared in default. 

Similarly, Atty. Supefia greatly prejudiced Santos' cause. Taking the foregoing accounts of a counsel's negligence into consideration, this Court finds it proper to adopt the penalty recommended by the IBP Board of Governors, which is suspension from the practice of law for two years.

ACCORDINGLY, Atty. Von Ronald Supefia is found administratively liable for violating the Lawyer's Oath, Canon 17, Rule 18.03 of Canon 18, and Canon 19 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Accordingly, he is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice oflaw for a period of two (2) years, effective immediately upon his receipt of this Resolution, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar act will be dealt with more severely.

  

Atty. Supefia is DIRECTED to FILE a Manifestation with this Court that his suspension has started, and to copy furnish all courts and quasijudicial bodies where he has entered his appearance as counsel.

Let copies of this Resolution be furnished to: (1) the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to Atty. Von Ronald Supefia's personal record as an attorney; (2) the -Integrated Bar of the Philippines for its information and guidance; and (3) the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts in the country.

  

SO ORDERED."
