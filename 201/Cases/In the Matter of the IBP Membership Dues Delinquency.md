Atty. Marcial A. Edillon
v.
The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), represented by its then President, Liliano B. Neri, and the IBP Board of Governors.

The subject of this case is  Atty. Marcial A. Edillon (Edillon) and his refusal to pay the required IBP membership dues. Edillon refused to pay, reasoning that the requirement was a violation of his constitutional rights. Edillon is antagonistic to the idea of being compelled to be a member of the IBP as a pre-condition to maintaining his status as a lawyer in good standing. He viewed the fees as a form of compelled financial support to an organization he does not agree with.

This issue was submitted to the Supreme Court. In said submission, the IBP claimed that they are acting in accordance with Section 24, Article III of the IBP By-Law, which empowers them to recommend disbarment to the Supreme Court for delinquency in paying dues for more than a year. Edillon then submitted his comment, reiterating his refusal to pay. To which the IBP replied and maintained that the non-payment of dues justified the removal of Edillon from the Roll of Attorneys. And that the enforcement of membership dues is essential for the integrity and functioning of the Bar, and that non-payment for an extended period constituted a violation that warrant disbarment.

Issue:

The Court had to determine whether Edillon's refusal to pay his membership dues to the IBP justified the removal of his name from the Roll of Attorneys and whether such mandatory requirements were constitutionally valid.

Decision:

Edillon is disbared. Atty. Marcial A. Edillon was  disbarred on August of 1978, for his stubborn refusal to pay his IBP membership dues. A requirement under the rules governing the profession - Rules of Court 139-A, Section 10 provides for mandatory membership of all lawyers in the IBP. It also outlines the consequences of non-payment of IBP dues, including suspension or removal from the Roll of Attorneys. The Court touched upon its constitutional authority  to regulate the practice of law as stated in Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the 1973 Constitution - to promulgate rules concerning the admission to the practice of law, and the supervision of the legal profession in the Philippines. 

Edillon pleaded for reinstatement. Over time Edillon's attitude towards the Court's authority and the mandatory dues changed, which is the subject of his plea for reinstatement. In it, he no longer exhibit his earlier stance and acknowledged the Court's competence in regulating the profession. Along with highlights to his continued dedication to the profession, he invoked mitigating circumstances - his health issues and advanced age.  On October 23, 1980, the Court exercised its discretion in granting the petition. Balancing the enforcement of discipline with the Edillon's contrition and mitigating circumstances.
