Fatima S. Ingram
Vs.
Atty. Jose Q. Lorica IV

The case is an administrative complaint for disbarment filed by Fatima S. Ingram (Ingram) against Atty. Jose Q. Lorica IV. The basis of Ingram's complaint was that Atty. Lorica, who had notarized a promissory note between the spouses Ingram and spouses Blanco. Lorica notarized the promissory note, certifying that the parties signed it voluntarily. Subsequently the Blancos defaulted in payment and hired Lorica as their counsel after the Ingram instituted a civil action. Lorica argued that the note was executed under coercion, threats, and intimidation. Lorica is attacking the validity of a document he certified, which Ingam pointed out as a conflict of interest. Ingram also accused Lorica of deliberately omitting a critical phrase in Article 1250 of the Civil Code when he cited it in his clients' defense. The omission was alleged to mislead the court in support of his clients' argument. The phrase "unless there is an agreement to the contrary" was ommitted. Article 1250 in its entirety reads:
> "In case of an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the currency stipulated should supervene, the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of the payment, **unless there is an agreement to the contrary.**

The Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) conducted an investigation regarding the actions of Lorica. The board found Atty. Lorica guilty of a glaring conflict of interest by undermining his own action as a notary public. The IBP also found that Lorica violated Rule 10.02 of the CRP by omitting the mentioned phrase and this was seen as a deliberate attempt to mislead. Based on the findings, the IBP recommended Lorica's suspension from the practice for a period of one year.


Issue/s

The Court needed to determine whether Lorica's representation of the spouses Blanco in challenging the validity of a promissory note he had notarized constituted a conflict of interest. The Court had to decide if this, given that no direct attorney-client relationship was established between Lorica and Ingram.

The Court needed to assess if Lorica's omission of the phrase "unless there is an agreement to the contrary" when citing Article 1250 of the Civil Code was a deliberate act of misrepresentation or dishonesty, as alleged by Ingram.

Decision:

The Court found Lorica guilty of violating Canon 7 of the CPR, which mandates lawyers to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession. Lorica's inconsistent positions on the validity of a promissory note he notarized, undermines the publicâ€™s confidence in the notarial process. The Court also found Atty. Lorica guilty of violating Rule 10.02 of the CPR, which prohibits knowingly misquoting or misrepresenting legal provisions.
