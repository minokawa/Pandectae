Ryan O. Lim
vs. 
Atty. Carlo Marco Bautista 
  
In this case are allegations of soliciting  money under false pretenses, and failing to protect the client interests against Atty. Carlo Marco Bautista by Ryan Anthony O. Lim.

Lim accuses Bautista of representing himself as having connections with the Makati Prosecutor's Office, claiming that he could influence the prosecutors to deliver a favorable resolution in a case involving Lim's father. This representation and supposed favorable outcome required Lim to issue checks amounting to millions of pesos to Bautista. 

Upon encashing checks, Bautista failed to provide an accounting and  did not return unused funds appropriated for the case, which did not result in the promised outcome. Atty. Bautista denied having an attorney-client relationship with Lim, despite the evidence of payments made to him for legal services.

The IBP recommended that Atty. Bautista be held accountable for his actions, which included severe breaches of legal ethics. The IBP's report and recommendation suggested that Atty. Bautista should face disciplinary action, with a strong indication that disbarment or suspension. These solicitations are under the pretext of influencing the outcome of a criminal case, leveraging supposed connections within the Makati Prosecutor's Office. Bautista also failed to provide an adequate accounting of the funds, this lack of transparency is a breach of ethical obligations. Considering the evidence presented which include checks and annotations, Bautista's conduct was found to be grossly unethical and disproves his denial of an attorney-client. 

Issues:

The Court is to decide wether to disbar Atty. Carlo Marco Bautista from the practice of law and clarify the nature of attorney-client relationship.


Decision:

The Supreme Court, while concurring with the findings of the IBP-CBD, modified the penalty to the ultimate sanction of disbarment. Atty. Bautista's actions were found to be egregious breaches of legal ethics, violating multiple Canons of the CPR which These include Canons 15, 17, 18, 19, and Rules 1.01 and 1.02 of Canon 1, and Rules 16.01 and 16.04 of Canon 16.

The absence of retainer agreement do not negate the existence of lawyer-client relationship. It is not an essential element in the employment of an attorney; a contract may be express or implied. The relationship is formed  when Lim provided legal advice to the Bautista regarding personal and family legal matters. 

Lawyers who are guilty of influence-peddling are unworthy of the title of an attorney, if the allegations are substantiated the penalty is disbarment. In this case, evidences are substantial - checks issued by Lim, behavior of Bautista it in cash, and the absurdity that the checks were given for safekeeping. Bautista's act of influence-peddling erodes the public's trust and confidence in the legal system.
