TEODORO R. REGALA, EDGARDO J. ANGARA, AVELINO V. CRUZ, JOSEC. CONCEPCION, ROGELIO A. VINLUAN, VICTOR P. LAZATIN, AND EDUARDO U. ESCUETA, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE SANDIGANBAYAN, FIRST DIVISION, REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, ACTING THROUGH THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT, AND RAUL S. ROCO, RESPONDENTS.

  

[G.R. NO. 108113.  SEPTEMBER 20, 1996]

  

PARAJA G. HAYUDINI, PETITIONER, VS. THE SANDIGANBAYAN AND THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.

  

D E C I S I O N

  

KAPUNAN, J.:

  

These cases touch the very cornerstone of every State's judicial system, upon which the workings of the contentious and adversarial system in the Philippine legal process are based - the sanctity of fiduciary duty in the client-lawyer relationship.  The fiduciary duty of a counsel and advocate is also what makes the law profession a unique position of trust and confidence, which distinguishes it from any other calling.  In this instance, we have no recourse but to uphold and strengthen the mantle of protection accorded to the confidentiality that proceeds from the performance of the lawyer's duty to his client.

  

The facts of the case are undisputed.

  

The matters raised herein are an offshoot of the institution of the Complaint on July 31, 1987 before the Sandiganbayan by the Republic of the Philippines, through the Presidential Commission on Good Government against Eduardo M. Cojuangco, Jr., as one of the principal defendants, for the recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth, which includes shares of stocks in the named corporations in PCGG Case No. 33 (Civil Case No. 0033), entitled "Republic of the Philippines versus Eduardo Cojuangco, et al."[1]

  

Among the defendants named in the case are herein petitioners Teodoro Regala, Edgardo J. Angara, Avelino V. Cruz, Jose C. Concepcion, Rogelio A. Vinluan, Victor P. Lazatin, Eduardo U. Escueta and Paraja G. Hayudini, and herein private respondent Raul S. Roco, who all were then partners of the law firm Angara, Abello, Concepcion, Regala and Cruz Law Offices (hereinafter referred to as the ACCRA Law Firm).  ACCRA Law Firm performed  legal services for its clients, which  included, among others, the organization and acquisition of business associations and/or organizations, with the correlative and incidental services where its members acted as incorporators, or simply, as stockholders.  More specifically, in the performance of these services, the members of the law firm delivered to its client documents which substantiate the client's equity holdings, i.e., stock certificates endorsed in blank representing the shares registered in the client's name, and a blank deed of trust or assignment covering said shares.  In the course of their dealings with their clients, the members of the law firm acquire information relative to the assets of clients as well as their personal and business circumstances.  As members of the ACCRA Law Firm, petitioners and private respondent Raul Roco admit that they assisted in the organization and acquisition of the companies included in Civil Case No. 0033, and in keeping with the office practice, ACCRA lawyers acted as nominees-stockholders of the said corporations involved in sequestration proceedings.[2]

  

On August 20, 1991, respondent Presidential Commission on Good Government (hereinafter referred to as respondent PCGG) filed a "Motion to Admit Third Amended Complaint" and "Third Amended Complaint" which excluded  private respondent Raul S. Roco from the complaint in PCGG Case No. 33 as party-defendant.[3] Respondent PCGG based its exclusion of private respondent Roco as party-defendant on his undertaking that he will reveal the identity of the principal/s for whom he acted as nominee/stockholder in the companies involved in PCGG Case No. 33.[4]

  

Petitioners were included in the Third Amended Complaint on the strength of the following allegations:

14. Defendants Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr., Edgardo J. Angara, Jose C. Concepcion, Teodoro Regala, Avelino V. Cruz, Rogelio A. Vinluan, Eduardo U. Escueta, Paraja G. Hayudini and Raul Roco of the Angara Concepcion Cruz Regala and Abello law offices (ACCRA) plotted, devised, schemed. conspired and confederated with each other in setting up, through the use of the coconut levy funds, the financial and corporate framework and structures that led to the establishment of UCPB, UNICOM, COCOLIFE, COCOMARK, CIC, and more than twenty other coconut levy funded corporations, including the acquisition of San Miguel Corporation shares and its institutionalization through presidential directives of the coconut monopoly. Through insidious means and machinations, ACCRA, being the wholly-owned investment arm, ACCRA Investments Corporation, became the holder of approximately fifteen million shares representing roughly 3.3% of the total outstanding capital stock of UCPB as of 31 March 1987. This ranks ACCRA Investments Corporation number 44 among the top 100 biggest stockholders of UCPB which has approximately 1,400,000 shareholders. On the other hand, corporate books show the name Edgardo J. Angara as holding approximately 3,744 shares as of February, 1984.[5]

In their answer to the Expanded Amended Complaint, petitioners ACCRA lawyers alleged that:

4.4.  Defendants-ACCRA lawyers’ participation in the acts with which their co-defendants are charged, was in furtherance of legitimate lawyering.

  

4.4.1.  In the course of rendering professional and legal services to clients, defendants-ACCRA lawyers, Jose C. Concepcion, Teodoro D. Regala, Rogelio A. Vinluan and Eduardo U. Escueta, became holders of shares of stock in the corporations listed under their respective names in Annex ‘A’ of the expanded Amended Complaint as incorporating or acquiring stockholders only and, as such, they do not claim any proprietary interest in the said shares of stock.

  

4.5.  Defendant ACCRA-lawyer Avelino V. Cruz was one of the incorporators in 1976 of Mermaid Marketing Corporation, which was organized for legitimate business purposes not related to the allegations of the expanded Amended Complaint.  However, he has long ago transferred any material interest therein and therefore denies that the ‘shares’ appearing in his name in Annex ‘A’ of the expanded Amended Complaint are his assets.[6]

Petitioner Paraja Hayudini, who had separated from ACCRA law firm, filed a separate answer denying the allegations in the complaint implicating him in the alleged ill-gotten wealth.[7]

  

Petitioners ACCRA lawyers subsequently filed their "COMMENT AND/OR OPPOSITION" dated October 8, 1991 with Counter-Motion that respondent PCGG similarly grant the same treatment to them (exclusion as parties-defendants) as accorded private respondent Roco.[8] The Counter-Motion for dropping petitioners from the complaint was duly set for hearing on October 18, 1991 in accordance with the requirements of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.

  

In its "Comment," respondent PCGG set the following conditions precedent for the exclusion of petitioners, namely:  (a) the disclosure of the identity of its clients; (b) submission of documents substantiating the lawyer-client relationship; and (c) the submission of the deeds of assignments petitioners executed in favor of its clients covering their respective shareholdings.[9]

  

Consequently, respondent PCGG presented supposed proof to substantiate compliance by private respondent Roco of the conditions precedent to warrant the latter's exclusion as party-defendant in PCGG Case No. 33, to wit: (a) Letter to respondent PCGG of the counsel of respondent Roco dated May 24, 1989 reiterating a previous request for reinvestigation by the PCGG  in PCGG Case No. 33; (b) Affidavit dated March 8, 1989 executed by private respondent Roco as Attachment to the letter aforestated in (a); and (c) Letter of the Roco, Bunag, and Kapunan Law Offices dated September 21, 1988 to the respondent PCGG in behalf of private respondent Roco originally requesting the reinvestigation and/or re-examination of the evidence of the PCGG against Roco in its  Complaint in PCGG Case No. 33.[10]

  

It is noteworthy that during said proceedings, private respondent Roco did not refute petitioners' contention that he did actually not reveal the identity of the client involved in PCGG Case No. 33, nor had he undertaken to reveal the identity of the client for whom he acted as nominee-stockholder.[11]

  

On March 18, 1992, respondent Sandiganbayan promulgated the Resolution, herein questioned, denying the exclusion of petitioners in PCGG Case No. 33, for their refusal to comply with the conditions required by respondent PCGG.  It held:

x x x.

  

ACCRA lawyers may take the heroic stance of not revealing the identity of the client for whom they have acted, i.e. their principal, and that will be their choice.  But until they do identify their clients, considerations of whether or not the privilege  claimed  by  the  ACCRA  lawyers  exists cannot even begin to be debated.  The ACCRA lawyers cannot excuse themselves from the  consequences  of their acts until they have begun to establish the basis for recognizing the privilege; the existence and identity of the client.

  

This is what appears to be the cause for which they have been impleaded by the PCGG as defendants herein.

  

5.  The PCGG is satisfied that defendant Roco has demonstrated his agency and that Roco has apparently identified his principal, which revelation could show the lack of cause  against him.  This in turn has allowed the PCGG to exercise its power both under the rules of Agency and under Section 5 of E.O. No. 14-A in relation to the Supreme Court's ruling in Republic v. Sandiganbayan (173 SCRA 72).

  

The PCGG has apparently offered to the ACCRA lawyers the same conditions availed of by Roco; full disclosure in exchange for exclusion from these proceedings (par. 7, PCGG's COMMENT dated November 4, 1991).  The ACCRA lawyers have preferred not to make the disclosures required by the PCGG.

  

The ACCRA lawyers cannot, therefore, begrudge the PCGG for keeping them as party defendants.  In the same vein, they cannot compel the PCGG to be accorded the same treatment accorded to Roco.

  

Neither can this Court.

  

WHEREFORE, the Counter Motion dated October 8, 1991 filed by the ACCRA lawyers and joined in by Atty. Paraja G. Hayudini for the same treatment by the PCGG as accorded to Raul S. Roco is DENIED for lack of merit.[12]

ACCRA lawyers moved for a reconsideration of the above resolution but the same was denied by the respondent Sandiganbayan.  Hence, the ACCRA lawyers filed the petition for certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 105938, invoking the following grounds:

  

I

  

The Honorable Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in subjecting petitioners ACCRA lawyers who undisputably acted as lawyers in serving as nominee-stockholders, to the strict application of the law of agency.

  

II

  

The Honorable Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion  in not considering petitioners ACCRA lawyers and Mr. Roco as similarly situated and, therefore, deserving of equal treatment.

  

1.  There is absolutely no evidence that Mr. Roco had revealed, or had undertaken to reveal, the identities of the client(s) for whom he acted as nominee-stockholder.

  

2.  Even assuming that Mr. Roco had revealed, or had undertaken to reveal, the identities of the client(s), the disclosure does not constitute a substantial distinction as would make the classification reasonable under the equal protection clause.

  

3.  Respondent Sandiganbayan sanctioned favoritism and undue preference in favor of Mr. Roco in violation of the equal protection clause.

  

III

  

The Honorable Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in not holding that, under the facts of this case, the attorney-client privilege prohibits petitioners ACCRA lawyers from revealing the identity of their client(s) and the other information requested by the PCGG.

  

1.  Under the peculiar facts of this case, the attorney-client privilege includes the identity of the client(s).

  

2.  The factual disclosures required by the PCGG are not limited to the identity of petitioners ACCRA lawyers' alleged client(s) but extend to other privileged matters.

  

IV

  

The Honorable Sandiganbayan committed grave abuse of discretion in not requiring that the dropping of party-defendants by the PCGG must be based on reasonable and just grounds and with due consideration to the constitutional right of petitioners ACCRA lawyers to the equal protection of the law.

Petitioner Paraja G. Hayudini, likewise, filed his own motion for reconsideration of the March 18, 1991 resolution which was denied by respondent Sandiganbayan.  Thus, he filed a separate petition for certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 108113, assailing respondent Sandiganbayan's resolution on essentially the same grounds averred by petitioners in G.R. No. 105938.

  

Petitioners contend that the exclusion of respondent Roco as party-defendant in PCGG Case No. 33 grants him a favorable treatment, on the pretext of his alleged undertaking to divulge the identity of his client, giving him an advantage over them who are in the same footing as partners in the ACCRA law firm.  Petitioners further argue that even granting that such an undertaking has been assumed by private respondent Roco, they are prohibited from revealing the identity of their principal under their sworn mandate and fiduciary duty as lawyers to uphold at all times the confidentiality of information obtained during such lawyer-client relationship.

  

Respondent PCGG, through its counsel, refutes petitioners' contention, alleging that the revelation of the identity of the client is not within the ambit of the lawyer-client confidentiality privilege, nor are the documents it required (deeds of assignment) protected, because they are evidence of nominee status.[13]

  

In his comment, respondent Roco asseverates that respondent PCGG acted correctly in excluding him as party-defendant because he "(Roco) has not filed an Answer.  PCGG had therefore the right to dismiss Civil Case No. 0033 as to Roco `without an order of court by filing a notice of dismissal,'"[14] and he has undertaken to identify his principal.[15]

  

Petitioners' contentions are impressed with merit.

  

I

  

It is quite apparent that petitioners were impleaded by the PCGG as co-defendants to force them to disclose the identity of their clients.  Clearly, respondent PCGG is not after petitioners but the “bigger fish” as they say in street parlance.  This ploy is quite clear from the PCGG’s willingness to cut a deal with petitioners -- the names of their clients in exchange for exclusion from the complaint.  The statement of the Sandiganbayan in its questioned resolution dated March 18, 1992 is explicit:

ACCRA lawyers may take the heroic stance of not revealing the identity of the client for whom they have acted, i.e., their principal, and that will be their choice.  But until they do identify their clients, considerations of whether or not the privilege claimed by the ACCRA lawyers exists cannot even begin to be debated.  The ACCRA lawyers cannot excuse themselves from the consequences of their acts until they have begun to establish the basis for recognizing the privilege; the existence and identity of the client.

  

This is what appears to be the cause for which they have been impleaded by the PCGG as defendants herein.  (Underscoring ours)

In a closely related case, Civil Case No. 0110 of the Sandiganbayan, Third Division, entitled "Primavera Farms, Inc., et al. vs. Presidential Commission on Good Government" respondent PCGG, through counsel Mario Ongkiko, manifested at the hearing on December 5, 1991 that the PCGG wanted to establish through the ACCRA that their "so called client is Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco"; that "it was Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco who furnished all the monies to those subscription payments in corporations included in Annex "A" of the Third Amended Complaint; that the ACCRA lawyers executed deeds of trust and deeds of assignment, some in the name of particular persons, some in blank.

We quote Atty. Ongkiko:

  

ATTY. ONGKIKO:

  

With the permission of this Hon. Court.  I propose to establish through these ACCRA lawyers that, one, their so-called client is Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco.  Second, it was Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco who furnished all the monies to these subscription payments of these corporations who are now the petitioners in this case.  Third, that these lawyers executed deeds of trust, some in the name of a particular person, some in blank.  Now, these blank deeds are important to our claim that some of the shares are actually being held by the nominees for the late President Marcos.  Fourth, they also executed deeds of assignment and some of these assignments have also blank assignees.  Again, this is important to our claim that some of the shares are for Mr. Cojuangco and some are for Mr. Marcos.  Fifth, that most of these corporations are really just paper corporations.  Why do we say that?  One:  There are no really fixed sets of officers, no fixed sets of directors at the time of incorporation and even up to 1986, which is the crucial year.  And not only that, they have no permits from the municipal authorities in Makati.  Next, actually all their addresses now are care of Villareal Law Office.  They really have no address on records.  These are some of the principal things that we would ask of these nominees stockholders, as they called themselves.[16]

It would seem that petitioners are merely standing in for their clients as defendants in the complaint.  Petitioners are being prosecuted solely on the basis of activities and services performed in the course of their duties as lawyers.  Quite obviously, petitioners’ inclusion as co-defendants in the complaint is merely being used as leverage to compel them to name their clients and consequently to enable the PCGG to nail these clients.  Such being the case, respondent PCGG has no valid cause of action as against petitioners and should exclude them from the Third Amended Complaint.

  

II

  

The nature of lawyer-client relationship is premised on the Roman Law concepts of locatio conductio operarum (contract of lease of services) where one person lets his services and another hires them without reference to the object of which the services are to be performed, wherein lawyers' services may be compensated by honorarium or for hire,[17] and mandato (contract of agency) wherein a friend on whom reliance could be placed makes a contract in his name, but gives up all that he gained by the contract to the person who requested him.[18] But the lawyer-client relationship is more than that of the principal-agent and lessor-lessee.

  

In modern day perception of the lawyer-client relationship, an attorney is more than a mere agent or servant, because he possesses special powers of trust and confidence reposed on him by his client.[19] A lawyer is also as independent as the judge of the court, thus his powers are entirely different from and superior to those of an ordinary agent.[20] Moreover, an attorney also occupies what may be considered as a "quasi-judicial office" since he is in fact an officer of the Court[21] and exercises his judgment in the choice of courses of action to be taken favorable to his client.

  

Thus, in the creation of lawyer-client relationship, there are rules, ethical conduct and duties that breathe life into it, among those, the fiduciary duty to his client which is of a very delicate, exacting and confidential character, requiring a very high degree of fidelity and good faith,[22] that is required by reason of necessity and public interest[23] based on the hypothesis that abstinence from seeking legal advice in a good cause is an evil which is fatal to the administration of justice.[24]

It is also the strict sense of fidelity of a lawyer to his client that distinguishes him from any other professional in society.  This conception is entrenched and embodies centuries of established and stable tradition.[25] In Stockton v. Ford,[26] the U.S. Supreme Court held:

  

There are few of the business relations of life involving a higher trust and confidence than that of attorney and client, or generally speaking, one more honorably and faithfully discharged; few more anxiously guarded by the law, or governed by the sterner principles of morality and justice; and it is the duty of the court to administer them in a corresponding spirit, and to be watchful and industrious, to see that confidence thus reposed shall not be used to the detriment or prejudice of the rights of the party bestowing it.[27]

In our jurisdiction, this privilege takes off from the old Code of Civil Procedure enacted by the Philippine Commission on August 7, 1901.  Section 383 of the Code specifically "forbids counsel, without authority of his client to reveal any communication made by the client to him or his advice given thereon in the course of professional employment."[28] Passed on into various provisions of the Rules of Court, the attorney-client privilege, as currently worded provides:

Sec. 24.  Disqualification by reason of privileged communication. - The following persons cannot testify as to matters learned in confidence in the following cases:

  

x x x

  

An attorney cannot, without the consent of his client, be examined as to any communication made by the client to him, or his advice given thereon in the course of, or with a view to, professional employment, can an attorney’s secretary, stenographer, or clerk be examined, without the consent of the client and his employer, concerning any fact the knowledge of which has been acquired in such capacity.[29]

  

Further, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court states:

  

Sec. 20.  It is the duty of an attorney:

  

(e) to maintain inviolate the confidence, and at every peril to himself, to preserve the secrets of his client, and to accept no compensation in connection with his client’s business except from him or with his knowledge and approval.

This duty is explicitly mandated in Canon 17 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which provides that:

Canon 17.  A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client  and he shall be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him.

Canon 15 of the Canons of Professional Ethics also demands a lawyer's fidelity to client:

The lawyer owes "entire devotion to the interest of the client, warm zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability," to the end that nothing be taken or be withheld from him, save by the rules of law, legally applied.  No fear of judicial disfavor or public popularity should restrain him from the full discharge of his duty.  In the judicial forum the client is entitled to the benefit of any and every remedy and defense that is authorized by the law of the land, and he may expect his lawyer to assert every such remedy or defense.  But it is steadfastly to be borne in mind that the great trust of the lawyer is to be performed within and not without the bounds of the law.  The office of attorney does not permit, much less does it demand of him for any client, violation of law or any manner of fraud or chicanery.  He must obey his own conscience and not that of his client.

Considerations favoring confidentiality in lawyer-client relationships are many and serve several constitutional and policy concerns.  In the constitutional sphere, the privilege gives flesh to one of the most sacrosanct rights available to the accused, the right to counsel.  If a client were made to choose between legal representation without effective communication and disclosure and legal representation with all his secrets revealed then he might be compelled, in some instances, to either opt to stay away from the judicial system or to lose the right to counsel.  If the price of disclosure is too high, or if it amounts to self incrimination, then the flow of information would be curtailed thereby rendering the right practically nugatory.  The threat this represents against another sacrosanct individual right, the right to be presumed innocent is at once self-evident.

  

Encouraging full disclosure to a lawyer by one seeking legal services opens the door to a whole spectrum of legal options which would otherwise be circumscribed by limited information engendered by a fear of disclosure.  An effective lawyer-client relationship is largely dependent upon the degree of confidence which exists between lawyer and client which in turn requires a situation which encourages a dynamic and fruitful exchange and flow of information.  It necessarily follows that in order to attain effective representation, the lawyer must invoke the privilege not as a matter of option but as a matter of duty and professional responsibility.

  

The question now arises whether or not this duty may be asserted in refusing to disclose the name of petitioners' client(s) in the case at bar.  Under the facts and circumstances obtaining in the instant case, the answer must be in the affirmative.

  

As a matter of public policy, a client’s identity should not be shrouded in mystery.[30] Under this premise, the general rule in our jurisdiction as well as in the United States is that a lawyer may not invoke the privilege and refuse to divulge the name or identity of his client.[31]

  

The reasons advanced for the general rule are well established.

  

First, the court has a right to know that the client whose privileged information is sought to be protected is flesh and blood.

  

Second, the privilege begins to exist only after the attorney-client relationship has been established.  The attorney-client privilege does not attach until there is a client.

  

Third, the privilege generally pertains to the subject matter of the relationship.

  

Finally, due process considerations require that the opposing party should, as a general rule, know his adversary. "A party suing or sued is entitled to know who his opponent is."[32] He cannot be obliged to grope in the dark against unknown forces.[33]

  

Notwithstanding these considerations, the general rule is however qualified by some important exceptions.

  

1)  Client identity is privileged where a strong probability exists that revealing the client’s name would implicate that client in the very activity for which he sought the lawyer’s advice.

  

In Ex-Parte Enzor,[34] a state supreme court reversed a lower court order requiring a lawyer to divulge the name of her client on the ground that the subject matter of the relationship was so closely related to the issue of the client’s identity that the privilege actually attached to both. In Enzor, the unidentified client, an election official, informed his attorney in confidence that he had been offered a bribe to violate election laws or that he had accepted a bribe to that end.  In her testimony, the attorney revealed that she had advised her client to count the votes correctly, but averred that she could not remember whether her client had been, in fact, bribed.  The lawyer was cited for contempt for her refusal to reveal his client’s identity before a grand jury.  Reversing the lower court’s contempt orders, the state supreme court held that under the circumstances of the case, and under the exceptions described above, even the name of the client was privileged.

  

U.S. v. Hodge and Zweig,[35] involved the same exception, i.e. that client identity is privileged in those instances where a strong probability exists that the disclosure of the client's identity would implicate the client in the very criminal activity for which the lawyer’s legal advice was obtained.

  

The Hodge case involved federal grand jury proceedings inquiring into the activities of the "Sandino Gang," a gang involved in the illegal importation of drugs in the United States. The respondents, law partners, represented key witnesses and suspects including the leader of the gang, Joe Sandino.

  

In  connection with a tax investigation in November of 1973, the IRS issued summons to Hodge and Zweig, requiring them to produce documents and information regarding payment received by Sandino on behalf of any other person, and vice versa.  The lawyers refused to divulge the names.  The Ninth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals, upholding non-disclosure under the facts and circumstances of the case,  held:

A client’s identity and the nature of that client’s fee arrangements may be privileged where the person invoking the privilege can show that a strong probability exists that disclosure of such information would implicate that client in the very criminal activity for which legal advice was sought Baird v. Koerner, 279 F.2d at 680.  While in Baird Owe enunciated this rule as a matter of California law, the rule also reflects federal law.  Appellants contend that the Baird exception applies to this case.

  

The Baird exception is entirely consonant with the principal policy behind the attorney-client privilege. "In order to promote freedom of consultation of legal advisors by clients, the apprehension of compelled disclosure from the legal advisors must be removed; hence, the law must prohibit such disclosure except on the client’s consent."  8 J. Wigmore, supra  sec. 2291, at 545.  In furtherance of this policy, the client’s identity and the nature of his fee arrangements are, in exceptional cases, protected as confidential communications.[36]

2) Where disclosure would open the client to civil liability, his identity is privileged.  For instance, the peculiar facts and circumstances of Neugass v. Terminal Cab Corporation,[37] prompted the New York Supreme Court to  allow a  lawyer’s  claim  to  the  effect  that he could not reveal the name of his client because this would expose the latter to civil litigation.

  

In the said case, Neugass, the plaintiff, suffered injury when the taxicab she was riding, owned by respondent corporation, collided with a second taxicab, whose owner was unknown.  Plaintiff brought action both against defendant corporation and the owner of the second cab, identified in the information only as John Doe.  It turned out that when the attorney of defendant corporation appeared on preliminary examination, the fact was somehow revealed that the lawyer came to know the name of the owner of the second cab when a man, a client of the insurance company, prior to the institution of legal action, came to him and reported that he was involved in a car accident.  It was apparent under the circumstances that the man was the owner of the second cab.  The state supreme court held that the reports were clearly made to the lawyer in his professional capacity.  The court said:

That his employment came about through the fact that the insurance company had hired him to defend its policyholders seems immaterial.  The attorney in such cases is clearly the attorney for the policyholder when the policyholder goes to him to report an occurrence contemplating that it would be used in an action or claim against him.[38]

  

x x x                      xxx                             xxx.

  

All communications made by a client to his counsel, for the purpose of professional advice or assistance, are privileged, whether they relate to a suit pending or contemplated, or to any other matter proper for such advice or aid; x x x And whenever the communication made, relates to a matter so connected with the employment as attorney or counsel as to afford presumption that it was the ground of the address by the client, then it is privileged from disclosure.  xxx.

  

It appears... that the name and address of the owner of the second cab came to the attorney in this case as a confidential communication.  His client is not seeking to use the courts, and his address cannot be disclosed on that theory, nor is the present action pending against him as service of the summons on him has not been effected.  The objections on which the court reserved decision are sustained.[39]

In the case of Matter of Shawmut Mining Company,[40] the lawyer involved was required by a lower court to disclose whether he represented certain clients in a certain transaction.  The purpose of the court’s request was to determine whether the unnamed persons as interested parties were connected with the purchase of properties involved in the action.  The lawyer refused and brought the question to the State Supreme Court.  Upholding the lawyer’s refusal to divulge the names of his clients the court held:

If it can compel the witness to state, as directed by the order appealed from, that he represented certain persons in the purchase or sale of these mines, it has made progress in establishing by such evidence their version of the litigation.  As already suggested, such testimony by the witness would compel him to disclose not only that he was attorney for certain people, but that, as the result of communications made to him in the course of such employment as such attorney, he knew that they were interested in certain transactions.  We feel sure that under such conditions no case has ever gone to the length of compelling an attorney, at the instance of a hostile litigant, to disclose not only his retainer, but the nature of the transactions to which it related, when such information could be made the basis of a suit against his client.[41]

3) Where the government’s lawyers have no case against an attorney’s client unless, by revealing the client’s name, the said name would furnish the only link that would form the chain of testimony necessary to convict an individual of a crime, the client’s name is privileged.

  

In Baird vs Korner,[42] a lawyer was consulted by the accountants and the lawyer of certain undisclosed taxpayers regarding steps to be taken to place the undisclosed taxpayers in a favorable position in case criminal charges were brought against them by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

  

It appeared that the taxpayers’ returns of previous years were probably incorrect and the taxes understated.  The clients themselves were unsure about whether or not they violated tax laws and sought advice from Baird on the hypothetical possibility that they had.  No investigation was then being undertaken by the IRS of the taxpayers.  Subsequently, the attorney of the taxpayers delivered to Baird the sum of $12,706.85, which had been previously assessed as the tax due, and another amount of money representing his fee for the advice given.  Baird then sent a check for $12,706.85 to the IRS in Baltimore, Maryland, with a note explaining the payment, but without naming his clients.  The IRS demanded that Baird identify the lawyers, accountants, and other clients involved.  Baird refused on the ground that he did not know their names, and declined to name the attorney and accountants because this constituted privileged communication.  A petition was filed for the enforcement of the IRS summons.  For Baird’s repeated refusal to name his clients he was found guilty of civil contempt.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that, a lawyer could not be forced to reveal the names of clients who employed him to pay sums of money to the government voluntarily in settlement of undetermined income taxes, unsued on, and with no government audit or investigation into that client’s income tax liability pending.  The court emphasized the exception that a client’s name is privileged when so much has been revealed concerning the legal services rendered that the disclosure of the client’s identity exposes him to possible investigation and sanction by government agencies.  The Court held:

The facts of the instant case bring it squarely within that exception to the general rule.  Here  money  was received by the government, paid by persons who  thereby admitted they had not paid a sufficient amount in income taxes some one  or more years in the past.  The names of the clients are useful to the government for but one purpose - to ascertain which taxpayers think they were delinquent, so that it may check the records for that one year or several years.  The voluntary nature of the payment indicates a belief by the taxpayers that more taxes or interest or penalties are due than the sum previously paid, if any.  It indicates a feeling of guilt for nonpayment of taxes, though whether it is criminal guilt is undisclosed.  But it may well be the link that could form the chain of testimony necessary to convict an individual of a federal crime.  Certainly the payment and  the feeling of guilt are the reasons the attorney here involved was employed - to advise his clients what, under the circumstances, should be done.[43]

Apart from these principal exceptions, there exist other situations which could qualify as exceptions to the general rule.

  

For example, the content of any client communication to a lawyer lies within the privilege if it is relevant to the subject matter of the legal problem on which the client seeks legal assistance.[44] Moreover, where the nature of the attorney-client relationship has been previously disclosed and it is the identity which is intended to be confidential, the identity of the client has been held to be privileged, since such revelation would otherwise result in disclosure of the entire transaction.[45]

  

Summarizing these exceptions, information relating to the identity of a client may fall within the ambit of the privilege when the client’s name itself has an independent significance, such that disclosure would then reveal client confidences.[46]

  

The circumstances involving the engagement of lawyers in the case at bench, therefore, clearly reveal that the instant case falls under at least two exceptions to the general rule.  First, disclosure of the alleged client's name would lead to establish said client's connection with the very fact in issue of the case, which is privileged information, because the privilege, as stated earlier, protects the subject matter or the substance (without which there would be no attorney-client relationship).

  

The link between the alleged criminal offense and the legal advice or legal service sought was duly established in the case at bar, by no less than the PCGG itself.  The key lies in the three specific conditions laid down by the PCGG which constitutes petitioners’ ticket to non-prosecution should they accede thereto:

(a)  the disclosure of the identity of its clients;

  

(b)  submission of documents substantiating the lawyer-client relationship; and

  

(c)  the submission of the deeds of assignment petitioners executed in favor of their clients covering their respective shareholdings.

From these conditions, particularly the third, we can readily deduce that the clients indeed consulted the petitioners, in their capacity as lawyers, regarding the financial and corporate structure, framework and set-up of the corporations in question.  In turn, petitioners gave their professional advice in the form of, among others, the aforementioned deeds of assignment covering their clients’ shareholdings.

  

There is no question that the preparation of the aforestated documents was part and parcel of petitioners’ legal service to their clients.  More important, it constituted an integral part of their duties as lawyers.  Petitioners, therefore, have a legitimate fear that identifying their clients would implicate them in the very activity for which legal advice had been sought, i.e., the alleged accumulation of ill-gotten wealth in the aforementioned corporations.

  

Furthermore, under the third main exception, revelation of the client's name would obviously provide the necessary link for the prosecution to build its case, where none otherwise exists.  It is the link, in the words of Baird, "that would inevitably form the chain of testimony necessary to convict the (client) of a... crime."[47]

  

An important distinction must be made between a case where a client takes on the services of an attorney for illicit purposes, seeking advice about how to go around the law for the purpose of committing illegal activities and a case where a client thinks he might have previously committed something illegal and consults his attorney about it.  The first case clearly does not fall within the privilege because the same cannot be invoked for purposes illegal.  The second case falls within the exception because whether or not the act for which the advice turns out to be illegal, his name cannot be used or disclosed if the disclosure leads to evidence, not yet in the hands of the prosecution, which might lead to possible  action against him.

  

These cases may be readily distinguished, because the privilege cannot be invoked or used as a shield for an illegal act, as in the first example; while the prosecution may not have a case against the client in the second example and cannot use the attorney client relationship to build up a case against the latter.  The reason for the first rule is that it is not within the professional character of a lawyer to give advice on the commission of a crime.[48] The reason for the second has been stated in the cases above discussed and are founded on the same policy grounds for which the attorney-client privilege, in general, exists.

  

In Matter of Shawmut Mining Co., supra, the appellate court therein stated that "under such conditions no case has ever yet gone to the length of compelling an attorney, at the instance of a hostile litigant, to disclose not only his retainer, but the nature of the transactions to which it related, when such information could be made the basis of a suit against his client."[49] "Communications made to an attorney in the course of any personal employment, relating to the subject thereof, and which may be supposed to be drawn out in consequence of the relation in which the parties stand to each other, are under the seal of confidence and entitled to protection as privileged communications."[50] Where the communicated information, which clearly falls within the privilege, would suggest possible criminal activity but there would be not much in the information known to the prosecution which would sustain a charge except that revealing the name of the client would open up other privileged information which would substantiate the prosecution’s suspicions, then the client’s identity is so inextricably linked to the subject matter itself that it falls within the protection.  The Baird exception, applicable to the instant case, is consonant with the principal policy behind the privilege, i.e., that for the purpose of promoting freedom of consultation of legal advisors by clients, apprehension of compelled disclosure from attorneys must be eliminated.  This exception has likewise been sustained in In re Grand Jury Proceedings[51] and Tillotson v. Boughner.[52] What these cases unanimously seek to avoid is the exploitation of the general rule in what may amount to a fishing expedition by the prosecution.

  

There are, after all, alternative sources of information available to the prosecutor which do not depend on utilizing a defendant's counsel as a convenient and readily available source of information in the building of a case against the latter.  Compelling disclosure of the client's name in circumstances such as the one which exists in the case at bench amounts to sanctioning fishing expeditions by lazy prosecutors and litigants which we cannot and will not countenance.  When the nature of the transaction would be revealed by disclosure of an attorney's retainer, such retainer is obviously protected by the privilege.[53] It follows that petitioner attorneys in the instant case owe their client(s) a duty and an obligation not to disclose the latter's identity which in turn requires them to invoke the privilege.

  

In fine, the crux of petitioners' objections ultimately hinges on their expectation that if the prosecution has a case against their clients, the latter's case should be built upon evidence painstakingly gathered by them from their own sources and not from compelled testimony requiring them to reveal the name of their clients, information which unavoidably reveals much about the nature of the transaction which may or may not be illegal.  The logical nexus between name and nature of transaction is so intimate in this case that it would be difficult to simply dissociate one from the other.  In this sense, the name is as much "communication" as information revealed directly about the transaction in question itself, a communication which is clearly and distinctly privileged.  A lawyer cannot reveal such communication without exposing himself to charges of violating a principle which forms the bulwark of the entire attorney-client relationship.

  

The uberrimei fidei relationship between a lawyer and his client therefore imposes a strict liability for negligence on the former.  The ethical duties owing to the client, including confidentiality, loyalty, competence, diligence as well as the responsibility to keep clients informed and protect their rights to make decisions have been zealously sustained.  In Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy v. Boon,[54] the US Second District Court rejected the plea of the petitioner law firm that it breached its fiduciary duty to its client by helping the latter's former agent in closing a deal for the agent's benefit only after its client hesitated in proceeding with the transaction, thus causing no harm to its client.  The Court instead ruled that breaches of a fiduciary relationship in any context comprise a special breed of cases that often loosen normally stringent requirements of causation and damages, and found in favor of the client.

  

To the same effect is the ruling in Searcy, Denney, Scarola, Barnhart, and Shipley P.A. v. Scheller[55] requiring strict obligation of lawyers vis-a-vis clients.  In this case, a contingent fee lawyer was fired shortly before the end of completion of his work, and sought payment quantum meruit of work done.  The court, however, found that the lawyer was fired for cause after he sought to pressure his client into signing a new fee agreement while settlement negotiations were at a critical stage.  While the client found a new lawyer during the interregnum, events forced the client to settle for less than what was originally offered.  Reiterating the principle  of fiduciary duty of lawyers to clients in Meinhard v. Salmon[56] famously attributed to Justice Benjamin Cardozo that "Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior," the US Court found that the lawyer involved was fired for cause, thus deserved no attorney's fees at all.

  

The utmost zeal given by Courts to the protection of the lawyer-client confidentiality privilege and lawyer's loyalty to his client is evident in the duration of the protection, which exists not only during the relationship, but extends even after the termination of the relationship.[57]

  

Such are the unrelenting duties required of lawyers vis-a-vis their clients because the law, which the lawyers are sworn to uphold, in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes,[58] "xxx is an exacting goddess, demanding of her votaries in intellectual and moral discipline."  The Court, no less, is not prepared to accept respondents’ position without denigrating the noble profession that is lawyering, so extolled by Justice Holmes in this wise:

Every calling is great when greatly pursued.  But what other gives such scope to realize the spontaneous energy of one's soul?  In what other does one plunge so deep in the stream of life - so share its passions its battles, its despair, its triumphs, both as witness and actor?  x x x  But that is not all.  What a subject is this in which we are united - this abstraction called the Law, wherein as in a magic mirror, we see reflected, not only in our lives, but the lives of all men that have been.  When I think on this majestic theme my eyes dazzle.  If we are to speak of the law as our mistress, we who are here know that she is a mistress only to be won with sustained and lonely passion - only to be won by straining all the faculties by which man is likened to God.

We have no choice but to uphold petitioners' right not to reveal the identity of their clients under pain of the breach of fiduciary duty owing to their clients, because the facts of the instant case clearly fall within recognized exceptions to the rule that the client’s name is not privileged information.

  

If we were to sustain respondent PCGG that the lawyer-client confidential privilege under the circumstances obtaining here does not cover the identity of the client, then it would expose the lawyers themselves to possible litigation by their clients in view of the strict fiduciary responsibility imposed on them in the exercise of their duties.

  

The complaint in Civil Case No. 0033 alleged that the defendants therein, including herein petitioners and Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. conspired with each other in setting up through the use of coconut levy funds the financial and corporate framework and structures that led to the establishment of UCPB, UNICOM and others and that through insidious means and machinations, ACCRA, using its wholly-owned investment arm, ACCRA Investments Corporation, became the holder of approximately fifteen million shares representing roughly 3.3% of the total capital stock of UCPB as of 31 March 1987.  The PCGG wanted to establish through the ACCRA lawyers that Mr. Cojuangco is their client and it was Cojuangco who furnished all the monies to the subscription payment; hence, petitioners acted as dummies, nominees and/or agents by allowing themselves, among others, to be used as instrument in accumulating ill-gotten wealth through government concessions, etc., which acts constitute gross abuse of official position and authority, flagrant breach of public trust, unjust enrichment, violation of the Constitution and laws of  the Republic of the Philippines.

  

By compelling petitioners, not only to reveal the identity of their clients, but worse, to submit to the PCGG documents substantiating the client-lawyer relationship, as well as deeds of assignment petitioners executed in favor of its clients covering their respective shareholdings, the PCGG would exact from petitioners a link "that would inevitably form the chain of testimony necessary to convict the (client) of a crime."

  

III

  

In response to petitioners' last assignment of error, respondents allege that the private respondent was dropped as party defendant not only because of his admission that he acted merely as a nominee but also because of his undertaking to testify to such facts and circumstances "as the interest of truth may require, which includes... the identity of the principal."[59]

  

First, as to the bare statement that private respondent merely acted as a lawyer and nominee, a statement made in his out-of-court settlement with the PCGG, it is sufficient to state that petitioners have likewise made the same claim not merely out-of- court but also in their Answer to plaintiff's Expanded Amended Complaint, signed by counsel, claiming that their acts were made in furtherance of "legitimate lawyering."[60] Being "similarly situated" in this regard, public respondents must show that there exist other conditions and circumstances which would warrant their treating the private respondent differently from petitioners in the case at bench in order to evade a violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

  

To this end, public respondents contend that the primary consideration behind their decision to sustain the PCGG's dropping of private respondent as a defendant was his promise to disclose the identities of the clients in question.  However, respondents failed to show - and absolutely nothing exists in the records of the case at bar - that private respondent actually revealed the identity of his client(s) to the PCGG.  Since the undertaking happens to be the leitmotif of the entire arrangement between Mr. Roco and the PCGG, an undertaking which is so material as to have justified PCGG's special treatment exempting the private respondent from prosecution, respondent Sandiganbayan should have required proof of the undertaking more substantial than a "bare assertion" that private respondent did indeed comply with the undertaking.  Instead, as manifested by the PCGG, only three documents were submitted for the purpose, two of which were mere requests for re-investigation and one simply disclosed certain clients which petitioners (ACCRA lawyers) were themselves willing to reveal.  These were clients to whom both petitioners and private respondent rendered legal services while all of them were partners at ACCRA, and were not the clients which the PCGG wanted disclosed for the alleged questioned transactions.[61]

  

To justify the dropping of the private respondent from the case or the filing of the suit in the respondent court without him, therefore, the PCGG should conclusively show that Mr. Roco was treated as a species apart from the rest of the ACCRA lawyers on the basis of a classification which made substantial distinctions based on real differences.  No such substantial distinctions exist from the records of the case at bench, in violation of the equal protection clause.

  

The equal protection clause is a guarantee which provides a wall of protection against uneven application of statutes and regulations.  In the broader sense, the guarantee operates against uneven application of legal norms so that all persons under similar circumstances would be accorded the same treatment.[62] Those who fall within a particular class ought to be treated alike not only as to privileges granted but also as to the liabilities imposed.

x x x.  What is required under this constitutional guarantee is the uniform operation of legal norms so that all persons under similar circumstances would be accorded the same treatment both in the privileges conferred and the liabilities imposed.  As was noted in a recent decision:  ‘Favoritism and undue preference cannot be allowed.  For the principle is that equal protection and security shall be given to every person under circumstances, which if not identical are analogous.  If law be looked upon in terms of burden or charges, those that  fall within a class should be treated in the same fashion, whatever restrictions cast on some in the group equally binding the rest.[63]

We find that the condition precedent required by the respondent PCGG of the petitioners for their exclusion as parties-defendants in PCGG Case No. 33 violates the lawyer-client confidentiality privilege.  The condition also constitutes a transgression by respondents Sandiganbayan and PCGG of the equal protection clause of the Constitution.[64] It is grossly unfair to exempt one similarly situated litigant from prosecution without allowing the same exemption to the others.  Moreover, the PCGG’s demand not only touches upon the question of the identity of their clients but also on documents related to the suspected transactions, not only in violation of the attorney-client privilege but also of the constitutional right against self-incrimination.  Whichever way one looks at it, this is a fishing expedition, a free ride at the expense of such rights.

  

An argument is advanced that the invocation by petitioners of the privilege of attorney-client confidentiality at this stage of the proceedings is premature and that they should wait until they are called to testify and examine as witnesses as to matters learned in confidence before they can raise their objections.  But petitioners are not mere witnesses.  They are co-principals in the case for recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth.  They have made their position clear from the very beginning that they are not willing to testify and they cannot be compelled to testify in view of their constitutional right against self-incrimination and of their fundamental legal right to maintain inviolate the privilege of attorney-client confidentiality.

  

It is clear then that the case against petitioners should never be allowed to take its full course in the Sandiganbayan.  Petitioners should not be made to suffer the effects of further litigation when it is obvious that their inclusion in the complaint arose from a privileged attorney-client relationship and as a means of coercing them to disclose the identities of their clients.  To allow the case to continue with respect to them when this Court could nip the problem in the bud at this early opportunity would be to sanction an unjust situation which we should not here countenance.  The case hangs as a real and palpable threat, a proverbial Sword of Damocles over petitioners' heads.  It should not be allowed to continue a day longer.

  

While we are aware of respondent PCGG’s legal mandate to recover ill-gotten wealth, we will not sanction acts which violate the equal protection guarantee and the right against self-incrimination and subvert the lawyer-client confidentiality privilege.
