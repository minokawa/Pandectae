Diokno M. Dimaculangan v. Atty. Jurado and Atty. Sta. Ana

The spouse of Atty. Girlie Dimaculangan's(Girlie), Diokno M. Dimaculangan, claimed harassment and intimidation when she was subjected to harassment and intimidation by Sta. Ana by shouting and by criticizing her actions in front of the courtroom. That Sta. Ana accused Girlie of requesting postponements in bad faith and failing to properly notify their party of changes in scheduling. This led to significant public humiliation in the presence of other lawyers and litigants. And caused distress on Girlie that was severe enough to be diagnosed as Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Major Depressive Episode. Girlie argued that the conduct of Jurado and Sta. Ana violated Canon 8 of the CPR - requiring lawyers to be courteous and fair toward their colleagues, and Rule 8.01 - prohibiting the use of abusive or offensive language.



The IBP found that the complaints against Jurado and Sta. Ana lacked merit and recommended dismissing the complaints, and the complaints did not provide sufficient grounds for disciplinary action against the respondents. There is an Admittance of Mistakes by Girlie  in her professional conduct, which led to the adverse reactions of Jurado and Sta Ana. Also Diokno Dimaculangan's inaction during the incidents and the failure to address or refute the allegations of his wife, Atty. Girlie, were noted.
The Spouses Dimaculangan were considered self-serving, and the incidents described were deemed to be part of normal litigation occurrences. The principle of Pari Delicto was applied to justify dismissal of the complaints, suggesting that both parties were at fault and thus negated the basis for the complaint.

Issues:

Whether the  Jurado and Sta. Ana's conduct constituted harassment, humiliation, and intimidation towards Girlie, and violates the CPR.

Whether the Spuses Dimaculangan provided adequate factual and legal basis for any disciplinary action against Jurado and Sta. Ana.

Decision:

The Supreme Court's decision was to adopt and accept the IBP's findings and recommendation to dismiss the complaints against Atty. Jurado and Atty. Sta. Ana. The Spouses' allegations did not meet the required quantum of evidence for disciplinary action. The evidence provided was deemed insufficient to justify the claims of harassment or misconduct against the respondents.

Rule 8.01, Canon 8 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, requires lawyers to conduct themselves with courtesy and fairness toward professional colleagues and to avoid harassing tactics against opposing counsel.

The Court emphasized that in administrative cases, the required quantum of evidence is substantial evidence. This means evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.

Section 5 of Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court, provides that if a complaint does not merit action, or if the answer shows that the complaint is not meritorious, it may be dismissed by the Board of Governors upon recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner.
