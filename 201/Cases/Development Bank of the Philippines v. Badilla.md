A.C. NO. 10931 FORMERLY CBD CASE NO. 17-5337, September 29, 2021

  

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES, REPRESENTED BY JOSE A. NUNEZ, JR. AND GIL A. BUENAVENTURA V. ATTY. FRANCIS ROMULO I. BADILLA, JR.

  

Sirs/Mesdames:

  

Please  take notice that the Court, First Division, issued a Resolution dated September 29, 2021 which reads as follows:

  

"A.C. No. 10931 [Formerly CBD Case No. 17-5337] (Development  Bank   of  the  Philippines, represented  by  Jose  A. Nunez,  Jr. and  Gil A. Buenaventura  v. Atty. Francis  Romulo  I. Badilla, Jr.)

  

By Joint Complaint[1] dated August 26, 2015, the Development Bank  of  the  Philippines   (DBP) represented  by  its  Chairman  and President Jose A. Nuñez, Jr. and Gil A. Buenaventura, respectively, charged respondent Atty. Francis Romulo I. Badilla, Jr. with violation of  the  Lawyer 's Oath  and Canons  15,  17,  and  19  of  the  Code  of Professional Responsibility (CPR).

  

DBP averred that on January 28,2015, respondent as President of the Association  of DBP Career Officials (ADCO),  along with the Development  Bank   of  the  Philippines  Employees Union  (DBP­ EU), issued a Joint Resolution imploring the DBP Board of Directors to   increase  to   Four   Thousand   Pesos (P4,000.00)   the   Personal Economic Relief Assistance (PERA) of all DBP employees  pursuant to the 2015 General Appropriations Act (GAA).[2]  Another Joint Resolution  was  signed  by  respondent,   this time  demanding  the payment of Performance-Based Bonus (PBB) for all qualified DBP employees who failed to receive the same.[3]

  

On May  29, 2015,  respondent,  as President  of ADCO,  along with Rudelito L. Tirado, Jr., President of DBP-EU filed the following cases before the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB), Criminal and Administrative Complaints, thus:

1.  OMB-C-C-15-0161 for  violation  of  Republic  Act  No. 3019  (RA  3019),[4]    Republic  Act  No.  8799  (RA 8799),[5] Article 244  of  The  Revised  Penal Code , Republic  Act No. 10149,[6] and the Administrative Code of 1987 against members of the DBP Board of Directors and its senior officers.  It was anchored  on the Audit  Observation Memorandum   No.  2014-Tro-01   (AOM)   of  the Commission  on Audit (COA) which sought  justification of the alleged wash sale of government securities in the amount of 14.3 billion pesos[7] and

  

2.  OMB-C-C-15-0162  for   Plunder   also   against   the Senior Officials of DBP, President, Chairman and Members of the Board of Directors, as well as the Commissioners    and     Officials      of     Governance Commission  for  GOCCs   and  GFis   (GCG)   in  the matter  of  the  grant  in  2014  of  Performance- Based Bonus (PBB) to DBP Top Management and other employees  in the   amount    of    P312,077,186.64 as approved  by GCG.[8]

According   to  the  DBP,  respondent   is  guilty  of  conflict  of interest under Canon 15 Rule 15.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility  (CPR)  when  he  signed  the  resolutions  and  letter requests  of ADCO  and  DBP-EU for the DBP Board of Directors  to increase   the   PERA   of  the  DBP  employees and  grant   additional benefits.  In so doing,  he in effect,  took  a position  adverse to DBP while acting as its legal officer.  If DBP does not grant the requested benefits,   cases may be filed against it and respondent, as DBP legal officer, would  be required to defend DBP's  action.[9]

  

Respondent  further  violated  not only the  Lawyer's Oath  but also Canon  17 of the CPR  when he filed the criminal cases before the OMB  since  he failed  to show  loyalty  and  fidelity  to his client DBP.

  

Too,  when  interviewed   by  media  on  the  graft  and  plunder charges  against  DBP  executives, respondent  issued   public statements[10]   which   were only   intended  to  sway   public   opinion against complainants in violation  of Rule  13.02,  Canon  13 of the CPR.[11]

  

Another.  He  committed  dishonesty when   he  claimed  to  be the  President of ADCO in  his sworn statement in the Complaint­ Affidavit  he  filed  before  the  OMB.  Records  show  that  ADCO's president is not  him, but Eddie Gefiosa.[12]

  

In his Comment[13] dated May 11, 2016, respondent riposted that there is no conflict of interest when  he filed  complaints before the OMB against Senior  Officers  of DBP, the President,  Chairman,  and members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  violation  of  RA  3019  and Plunder, among others. In so doing, he  simply acted  to  protect  the best   interest  of   DBP   as  he   called   the   attention   of  the   DBP management   to   comply  with   the   provisions  of  the   2015  GAA regarding the  grant of  PERA to  its employees and  the  grant  of PBB  to  qualified employees. [14]  His  act  was  actually for  the  best interest of  DBP  since  to follow  the law  on the grant  of employee benefits would avoid  future litigation. [15]

  

Pursuant  to the DBP Manual of Corporate  Governance, he, as a public servant must  ensure that DBP faithfully uphold the Constitution  and  timely  comply   with   all  applicable  legal provisiOns,     rules and    regulations,    and    corporate    governance standards.[16]

  

His membership in ADCO was  made  pursuant to  his  right to  join  and  form associations guaranteed in Section 8, Article III of the Constitution.[17]

  

DBP Senior Officials are duty bound  to  protect public funds and   when  they   engaged in corrupt practices, they have placed themselves  in  a contrary position  with  DBP  and they themselves harbor conflict  of interest. DBP Senior Officials have no right to use DBP resources to get back at those who are acting in behalf of DBP, such as himself.[18]

  

The  public  statements he  made  before  the  media  did  not cause  any  damage to DBP  since  it was simply  intended  to inform that the case was filed and the reasons why it was filed.[19]

  

Whatever damage and prejudice the Senior Officials may have experienced  was well deserved.  These Senior Officials,  by virtue of their  positions  in government,  were  tasked  to  protect  and  preserve public funds and yet they stole from the public coffers, hence, it is his right,  nay,  moral  obligation   to expose  the scandal committed by Senior  Officers  of DBP  in plundering  the government's coffers,  to the damage and prejudice of the Filipino people.[20]

  

Assuming  there was reputational  damage caused  to DBP, this was due entirely to the greed and avarice of the senior officials  who were exposed and being made accountable.[21]

  

While he works for DBP as an in-house counsel, he, however, was  not the counsel  for  DBP-ADCO; hence, the rule on conflict of interest under the CPR does not apply to him. Complainants  failed to show that respondent signed any pleading or made any legal representation in favor of ADCO and DBP-EU.[22]

  

The present complaint is one of the many harassment suits filed by DBP officials against him.[23]

  

The Report and  Recommendation of the IBP Investigating Commissioner

  

Per   Report   and   Recommendation [24]    dated   May   21,   2019, Investigating  IBP Commissioner Roland  B. Beltran  held respondent guilty of conflict  of interest, use of intemperate  language, accusation of  a  crime   without   regard   to  the  constitutional   presumption   of innocence,   all  in  violation   of the  Lawyer's   Oath  and   Code  of Professional Responsibility, viz.:

WHEREFORE,    it   is   hereby   recommended    that   Atty. Francis  Romulo  I. Badilla,  Jr. be suspended  from  the  practice of law  for  six  (6)  months  for  conduct  unbecoming  of  a  lawyer, violation of lawyer's  oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, with warning that any repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with severely.[25]

Commissioner Beltran noted that respondent is the in-house counsel   of  DBP.   As   such,  an  attorney- client   relationship   exists between DBP and respondent.[26]

  

On the other hand, as ADCO, respondent represented causes adverse to his client, DBP.[27]  The cases filed by respondent are  suits against his  own  client  DBP  and  not  only  against DBP's officers who notably were sued  in their  official capacity.[28]

  

He  violated  Canon  17[29]     and  Rule  15.03,  Canon  15[30]     of the CPR when he filed the administrative and criminal cases in question since he is DBP's in-house counsel.[31]

  

He used intemperate language in his Comment dated May II, 2016 where he accused the Senior Officers of DBP of having "stolen from   the   public   coffers,"   and   branded   them   as   "thieves   and scoundrels,"   who  had  "greed   and  avarice".     Such  an  unfair  and reckless statement  coming from one who is a disciple of the law and who has taken the lawyer's  oath, should not be countenanced.[32]

  

The AOM  issued  by COA sought an explanation of the action being assailed therein, hence, the AOM  is far  from  being final. It is not even  a Notice  of Disallowance  so it is premature to conclude that   the Senior   Officers   of  DBP  are  corrupt officials  who  give themselves additional  bonuses apart from their regular salaries. There was no cause of action to file the cases before the OMB on the basis of an AOM and respondent ought to know that.[33]

  

As a lawyer,  respondent's actions  failed to conform  with  the ethical rules and standards of the lawyer's oath and the CPR.[34]

  

The Report and  Recommendation of the IBP Board  of Governors

  

By Resolution[35]  dated  December  15,  2019,  the IBP  Board  of Governors reversed, thus:

RESOLVED to REVERSE, as it is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution   as  Annex "A,"   and  considering   that  there  was  no conflict of interest on the part of the Respondent, the case is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.

  

RESOLVED  FURTHER,  that the Commission  prepare  an extended resolution explaining the Board action.[36]

Per Extended Resolution[37]  dated September 14, 2020, the IBP Board of Governors held that there was no conflict  of interest when respondent filed  the  criminal and  administrative cases  against the DBP officers.  DBP never  posited that respondent's act of filing criminal  and  administrative   cases  against its  board  members  and several senior officers conflicted  with his interest as DBP in-house counsel.  At any  rate,  there  could  not  have  been  any  conflict  of interest DBP's since the criminal and administrative charges were filed  against said   directors and   officers   and  not  against  DBP itself.

  

Too, it noted that DBP is in-house counsel, when respondent issued  demands and  claims  against  the DBP  management, respondent acts  as President of ADCO  and  not its legal counsel, hence, in the absence of lawyer-client relationship, there could be no conflict of interest to speak of.[38]

  

In another vein, respondent's public statements before the media  did  not intend  to tarnish the reputation of DBP. To repeat, the   administrative   and   criminal   charges   respondent   filed   were against senior  officials of DBP in their  personal capacities.[39]

  

Finally, since ADCO's  Secretary Certificate specifically states that through ADCO Board Resolution No. 004-2015 dated March 11, 2015,   the   Board   of  Trustees  resolved   to  name   and   appoint respondent as  its  President,  respondent  did   not  lie  when  he claimed to be ADCO's  President in his complaint- affidavit[40]

  

Issues

1.  Is  respondent  guilty  of  conflict  of  interest  in  violation  of Rules 15.01 and 15.03 of the CPR?

2.  Did  respondent  violate  Rule  13.02  of  the  CPR  when  he made public statements  in the media regarding the criminal and  administrative   cases  he  filed  against  DBP  officials before the Office of the Ombudsman?

  

3.  Did  respondent  violate  Rule  10.01  of  the  CPR  and  the Lawyer's    Oath   when  he  allegedly  lied about  being  the President of ADCO?

Ruling

  

We affirm the Resolution of the IBP Board of Governors and dismiss the complaint.

  

Respondent     is    NOT    guilty     of

representing       conflicting      interest

when he signed the Joint Resolutions

of ADCO and DBPEU

  

The prohibition  against Conflict of Interest is enshrined under Rules  15.01  and  15.03  of the  Code  of Professional Responsibility (CPR), to wit:

Rule 15.01. -A lawyer, in conferring  with a prospective client,  shall  ascertain  as  soon  as  practicable whether  the  matter would  involve  a conflict  with another  client or his own  interest, and if so, shall forthwith inform the prospective client.

  

Rule  15.03.  - A  lawyer  shall  not  represent  conflicting interests  except  by written consent  of all concerned  given after a full disclosure of the facts.

The test of conflict  of interest  is "whether or not in behalf of one client, it is the lawyer's  duty to fight for an issue or claim, but it is his/her duty to oppose  it for the other client.  In brief,  if he/she argues for one client, this argument will be opposed by him/her when he/she  argues  for  the  other  client."[41]   Another test  of  the inconsistency of interests is whether the acceptance of a new relation will  prevent  attorneys from  the  full  discharge  of  their  duty  of undivided fidelity and loyalty to their clients or invite suspicion of unfaithfulness or double-dealing in the performance of said duty. [42] It prohibits  a  lawyer from  representing  new  clients  whose  interests oppose those of a former client in any manner, whether or not they are parties in the same action or on totally unrelated cases.[43]

  

This rule covers not only cases in which confidential communications have been confided, but also those in which no confidence has been bestowed or will be used.[44]  It applies regardless of the degree of adverse interests.[45] Conflict of interest already exists when there is a substantial risk that a lawyer's loyalty to or representation  of a client would be materially or adversely affected by the lawyer's own interest or the lawyer's duties to another client, a former  client  or  a  third  person.  The  rule  addresses  the  risk  of impairment rather than  actual  impairment. The level of risk contemplated  by the rule is substantial. That is, the  risk  must  be significant and  plausible.  It must be more than  a mere  possibility; there must  be a genuine,  serious  risk  to the duty  of loyalty  or to client representation. But the risk need not be likely or probable.

  

The  prohibition  against  conflict  of  interest  seeks  to  assure clients that their lawyers will represent them with undivided loyalty. The prohibition further strives to enhance the effectiveness of legal representation. To the extent that a conflict of interest undermines the independence  of  the  lawyer's professional  judgment  or  inhibits  a lawyer from working with appropriate vigor in the client's  behalf, the client's  expectation  of effective representation  could be compromised.[46]

  

The Court in Tan v. Atty. Alvarico [47] held that the absence of a formal engagement  would not preclude the finding  of an attorney­ client  relationship,  and  the  absence  of  such relationship would not preclude  the finding  of a violation  of the rule on conflict  of interests. Also, the prohibition against representation of conflicting interests applies  even  if the conflict  pertains  to the lawyer's private activity  or in the performance of a function  in a nonprofessional capacity.[48]

  

Respondent was not  involved in a conflict  of interest  situation when   he   signed   the   resolutions pertaining   to   the   demand  for payment of  PERA and  PBB  from  the  DBP  and  when  he filed  the administrative  and    criminal  actions  before   the   OMB   against officials  of DBP.

  

We stress that  his client  was  not  only  DBP  but  also  public interest, which  means  adherence to the rule  of law.  These  are  no ordinary clients and respondent is no ordinary lawyer. His retainer is a public appointment paper and is paid by public funds. Hence, in a situation  where  the  government agency which  the  government lawyer  works  for  is attempting to  act  in  violation of  the  rule  of law,  the government  lawyer  is  not  simply required  to  resign   or advise the government agency of the wrongfulness of its intended action, but  must   pursue a course of conduct consistent with  the norms of conduct for public officers under the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. After all, a government lawyer's  conduct  consistent  with   these   norms  can never  be against the best interests  of the client government agency.

  

Here, the claim for PERA and PBB, if truly provided  by law as claimed  by respondent, would  redound to the  best interests of DBP and  the  public interest as this would mean adherence to the  rule  of law.  The same   is  true  with  his  act  of  filing   complaints for   the criminal acts   allegedly   committed   by some  of  the  DBP  officials. Again,  if this  is true,  he would  have contributed to the public  policy that no  one  is  above the  law.  Besides,  these  officials  are  not  his clients. They  are the agents of one of respondent's clients  - DBP - but he is not answerable to them for the duties owed to a client.

  

Respondent's  actions   are  consistent  with,   if  not  going   to promote the best interests  of his clients DBP and public interest. As such,  the  same  cannot be  illustrative of conflict  of  interest.  If his allegations turn  out  to  be  false  and   done  in  bad  faith,  the  proper cause  of action  is not  conflict  of interest  but some  other  remedy, if at all, available  to the sued DBP officials  or DBP itself.

  

It may  be suggested  that  the rejection  by DBP  of  the Joint Resolutions would result in a case and respondent would then be defending conflicting positions. In the first place, while conflict of interest addresses the mere risk  of it, the risk  must be substantial and  not  speculative.  In  any  event,  given the  conflicting   legal positions of DBP and respondent's  idea of what the state of the law is,  he  is neither   obliged   to  resign  as  DBP's   legal  officer   nor duty bound to represent DBP in this future legal case. This is not a  case of disobedience because it is based on bona fide differences of legal opinions.

  

Respondent's   public  statements  in the media did not violate Rule 13.02 of the CPR

Rule 13.02 of the CPR reads:

  

Rule 13.02 - A lawyer  shall  not  make  public  statements in the media  regarding a pending  case tending  to arouse public opinion for or against a party.

In relation to this foregoing provision, it is essential to discuss the concept of the sub judice rule vis-a-vis the complaint against respondent.

  

Sub  Judice 1s  a Latin term which refers to matters  under or before a judge or court; or matters under judicial consideration. In essence, the sub judice rule restricts comments and disclosures pe1iaining  to pending   judicial   proceedings   in   order   to   avoid prejudging the issue, influencing the court, or obstructing the administration of justice.[49] The restriction applies to litigants and witnesses, the public in general, and most especially to members of the Bar and the Bench.[50]

  

A  violation  of  this  rule  may  render  one  liable  for  indirect contempt under Sec. 3(d), Rule 71[51] of the Rules of Court.

  

For a comment to be considered as indirect contempt of court, "it must really appear" that such does impede, interfere with and embarrass the administration of justice. What is, thus, sought to be protected is the all important  duty of the court to administer justice in the  decision  of  a  pending  case.  The specific  rationale  for  the  sub judice  rule is that  courts,  in the decision  of issues  of fact and  law should be immune from every extraneous influence; that facts should be  decided  upon  evidence produced  in  court;  and  that  the determination    of   such   facts   should   be   uninfluenced    by   bias, prejudice, or sympathies.[52]

  

Actions  in violation  of the sub judice rule may be dealt with not  only  through  contempt  proceedings but  also  through administrative  actions. This is because a lawyer speech  is subject to greater regulation for two (2) significant reasons: one, because of the lawyer's relationship to the judicial process; and two, the significant dangers that a lawyer's  speech poses to the trial process.[53]  Hence, in Republic  v. Sereno, [54]    the  Court  resolved  to  treat  the  matter  of respondent's public utterances in a separate administrative  action. Indeed, this Court has the plenary power to discipline erring lawyers through this kind of proceeding, aimed to purge the law profession of unwmthy members of the Bar and to preserve the nobility and honor of the legal profession.

  

In P/Supt. Marantan  v. Atty. Diokno, et al., [55]   the Court held that  the  utterances   of  respondent- counsels   relative  to  a  pending homicide case are not violative of the sub judice rule and Rule 13.02 of the   CPR   in  that   the   comments   were   mere   reiterations   of respondent-counsels' position in the criminal case which calls for the Court to upgrade the charges from homicide to murder. Further, respondent-counsels' comments  simply stated that the Court has yet to resolve their  petition.  The mere restatement  of their argument  in their petition cannot actually, or does not even tend to, influence the Court.

  

Here,   on   May   29,  2015,   Inquirer.Net   released   an   article relative   to  the   graft   complaint which  respondent   and   DBP-EU President Rudelito Tirado Jr. filed against DBP officials. The article quoted  respondent's  statement   before  the  media  after  filing  the complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman, thus:

We  have  a  reason  to  believe  that  merong  kumita.  Hindi lang  namin  ma-establish  right  now. Logic  will  show  that  kapag may perang nawala, may napuntahan ang pera. Obviously, may nakinabang  (We have reason to believe someone profited. We just couldn't  establish who right now. Logs will show that if money got lost, it must have gone to someone).[56]

As correctly  held  by the IBP Board of Governors,  respondent did not violate Rule 13.02 of the CPR when he uttered the foregoing statement since it merely informed the public of the reason why the criminal and  administrative   cases  against  DBP  officials  were  filed before the OMB. It does not in any way pose a serious and imminent threat  to  the  administration  of  justice.  Too,  there  was  no  intent  to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration  of justice which may be inferred from respondent's

statement.

  

Respondent   did  NOT   violate  Rule

10.01 of the CPR and the Lawyer's

Oath  when  he  identified

himself  as the President of ADCO

Rule 10.01 of the CPR ordains, thus:

  

Rule  10.01. - A lawyer  shall  not do any falsehood, nor  consent to the  doing  of any  in Court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice.

Spouses  Umaguing  v. De Vera[57]   emphasized  that  the  oath taken by every lawyer in relation to Rule 10.01 of the CPR promises obedience to the laws of the land and desistance from doing any falsehood:

The Lawyer's  Oath enjoins every lawyer not only to obey the laws of the land but also to refrain from doing any falsehood in or out of court or from consenting to the doing of any in court, and to conduct himself according to the best of his knowledge and discretion  with  all  good  fidelity  to  the  courts  as well  as  to  his clients.  Every  lawyer  is a servant of the law, and has to observe and maintain  the rule of law as well as be an exemplar  worthy of emulation  by others.  It is by no means  a coincidence, therefore, that the core values of honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness are emphatically  reiterated  by the Code of Professional  Responsibility. In this  light,  Rule  10.01,  Canon  10 of the Code  of Professional Responsibility  provides that "[a] lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent  to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice."

As found by the IBP Board of Governors, respondent did not commit any falsehood  when he identified himself as the President of ADCO in the Complaint-Affidavit  he filed before the OMB because ADCO's Secretary Certificate specifically stated that through ADCO Board Resolution No. 0042015 dated March 11, 2015, the Board of Trustees resolved to name and appoint him as its President. Hence, respondent  did not violate the Lawyer's  Oath and Rule 10.01  of the CPR since he did not lie when he claimed to be ADCO's President.

  

ACCORDINGLY,  the Resolution dated December 15, 2019 of the Integrated  Bar of the Philippines Board  of Gove1nors is AFFIRMED.    The   complaint    against   respondent   Atty.   Francis Romulo Badilla Jr. is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

  

SO ORDERED."
