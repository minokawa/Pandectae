The stolen chart entries can refute the claims of negligence against the complaianants. IBP's investigation revealed that Grecia had stolen two pages from the medical chart, and is material evidences in the lawsuit against the complainants. It was concluded that Grecia violated the ethical standards stated in Rule 1.01 of Canon 1 and Canon 7 of the CPR which prohibit unlawful, dishonest, and deceitful conduct. Given that this is Grecia's second offense, the first being a disbarment for immoral complicity, the IBP recommended the severe penalty of disbarment. 

Issue:

The Court must evaluate if Grecia's actions constitute dishonesty and unethical behavior. And if the prior disbarment and reinstatement justifies the penalty of disbarment once again.


Decision:

The Court found Attorney Grecia guilty of grave misconduct, dishonesty, and grossly unethical behavior. The act and his overall conduct are clear violations of the following.

Canon 1, a lawyer should uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession.

Rule 1.01, a lawyer shall not engage in unlawful, dishonest, immoral, or deceitful conduct.

Canon 7 of the CPR, a lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and support the activities of the Integrated Bar.

Misconduct that casts doubt on a lawyer’s moral characteris a ground for disbarment, as it renders the individual unfit to practice law. The decision cited  Melendrez vs. Decena, emphasizing that lawyers need to adhere to ethical standards and a severe misconduct undermines public confidence. As this was Grecia’s second offense, the Court imposed the supreme penalty of disbarment. His license to practice law in the Philippines was canceled, and his name was ordered to be struck off the Roll of Attorneys.
