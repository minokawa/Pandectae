Atty. Carlos M. Canilao
Engr. Nazita F. Banez
vs.
Atty. Francis Rae G. Camtugan II

This administrative case concerns Atty. Camtugan II (Camtugan), counsel of those affected by  Baguio Mayor Domogan's demolition order. Camtugan challenged the demolition in a 'passionately written' pleading. That pleading is called into the attention of  the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBR) through a complaint against Camtugan. The complaint is penned by members of the city's Anti-Squatting and Illegal Structures Committee - Atty. Canilao and Engr. Banez. The complainant accuses Camtugan of making it appear that Mayor Domogan was the one charged in 'Alangdeo v. Mayor of Baguio', and also misinterpreted another case. That he overstepped the boundaries of courtesy by using the words 'parroting', 'defanged', 'mindless animals', 'open rebellion' and 'blatantly illegal'.  And violated the rule on forum shopping by imploring other government agency. The OBR found it proper to send this issue to IBP-CBD for investigation. 

IBP-CBD recommended the dismissal of the complaint. They stated that the words "parroting" and "defanged", were words of common usage and do not constitute offensive language. While forceful, the words are not offensive in the context they were used. On forum shopping, the IBP-CBD cleared Camtugan of forum shopping, since agencies agencies implored by Camtugan are not part of the judiciary. They did acknowledge Camtugan's misquoting of jurisprudence and that it was a result of his excusable negligence.  

Issue/s

The Court needed to determine whether the following actions of Atty. Camtugan constituted professional misconduct under the CPR:

Did Camtugan knowingly misquote or misrepresent legal texts or decisions a a violation of Rule 10.02, Canon 10 of the CPR?

Did Camtugan's language violate the ethical standards required of lawyers to maintain courtesy, fairness, and candor in their professional dealings

Decision

The Court agreed with the IBP that thdere is no clear case of misconduct.


Canon 8, which requires lawyers to conduct themselves with courtesy, fairness, and candor in all their dealings. Canon 10, lawyer shall not knowingly misquote or misrepresent the contents of a paper, the language or argument of the opposing counsel, the text of a decision or authority, or knowingly cite as law a provision already rendered inoperative by repeal or amendment, or assert as a fact that which has not been proved. Canon 12, which focuses on the duty of lawyers to exert all efforts to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. Canon 13, which emphasizes the lawyer's responsibility to maintain the integrity and competence of the legal profession.

Rule 138 Section 20(b) and (f) of the ROC. Section 20(b), lawyers are required to abstain from all offensive personalities and to advance no fact prejudicial to the honor or reputation of a party or witness unless required by the justice of the cause. Section 20(f), lawyers must not knowingly make a false statement of law or fact.

On his language, the Court found that the supposedly offensive words are merely forceful and emphatic, taken within the context within which they were used. 

On him misleading the court, the evidence fell short in establishing the 'act of lying or cheating' and the intention to mislead. However, Camtugan still relied on his own interpretation and conclusions of the cases. He is admonished to be more careful in his future citations.  Camtugan is found GUILTY of violation of Rule 10.02 of the CPR.
