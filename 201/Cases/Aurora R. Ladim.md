A.C. No. 10372, July 30, 2014

AURORA R. LADIM, ANGELITO A. ARDIENTE, AND DANILO S. DE LA CRUZ V. ATTY. PERLA D. RAMIREZ.

  

Sirs/Mesdames:

  

Please take notice that the Court, Third Division, issued a Resolution dated July 30, 2014, which reads as follows:

"A.C. No. 10372 (Aurora R. Ladim, Angelito A. Ardiente, and Danilo S. de la Cruz v. Atty. Perla D. Ramirez). - On March 23, 2007, a verified complaint[1] for disbarment was filed against Atty. Perla D. Ramirez by Aurora R. Ladim, Angelito A. Ardiente, and Danilo S. de la Cruz, who were all employees of Lirio Apartments Condominium in Makati City, where Atty. Ramirez resides.[2]

  

The complaint stemmed from various incidents from 1990 to 2007 involving complainants, other employees, lessees, and unit owners of Lirio Apartments Condominium and Atty. Ramirez.[3] The tenants alleged that Atty. Ramirez kept asking "impertinent personal questions,"[4] knocking on their doors, and using offensive language.[5] Another tenant complained that Atty. Ramirez kept entering units undergoing repairs "[b]ecause of her fear that people [were] damaging the building."[6] The "keys hanging [on] the door"[7] of one unit were lost the day she entered the unit.[8]

  

The latest incident involved Atty. Ramirez shouting at the condominium employees and using offensive language.[9] She accused the maintenance personnel of destroying the building and the security guards of trying to destroy her car.[10] She also started shouting that the condominium residents were prostitutes.[11] The condominium employees tried to pacify her, even calling her brother, Dr. Nicholas Ramirez, to intervene.[12] "Dr. Ramirez assured [them] that he will get in touch"[13] with Atty. Ramirez's friend, Malou Jacob, since Malou was the only one who could pacify her.[14]

  

Since 2004, Atty. Ramirez has refused to pay any of her association dues.[15] She claimed that no one has been leasing her unit[16] and argued that the association dues should be paid only by those who lease their units.[17]

  

Atty. Ramirez, on the other hand, filed several cases before the Office of the City Prosecutor against the condominium employees, accusing them of malicious mischief, grave oral defamation, slander, and threats.[18] All the cases were dismissed for lack of merit.[19]

  

In her position paper[20] before the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP), Atty. Ramirez did not admit or deny the allegations in her complaint but stated her long years of service as a government lawyer.[21] She also expressed that:

  

I do not believe that the three complainants are my equal, therefore, for reasons above stated, [sic] I move for the outright dismissal of the complaints charge [sic] against me.[22]

  

In his report and recommendation,[23] the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Investigating Commissioner Eldrid C. Antiquiera found Atty. Ramirez guilty of violating Rule 7.03, Canon 7 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and recommended the penalty of reprimand.[24]

  

Commissioner Antiquiera found that "respondent's language and choice of words [show] her lack of respect and decorum in her dealings with other people."[25] He also found that Atty. Ramirez "largely relied on her legal expertise and experience to demand respect from others but she never [gave] them a fair treatment."[26]

  

The Commissioner, however, took note of the "forgetful, suspicious, and fearful attitude"[27] of Atty. Ramirez and complainants' belief that "something must be wrong with her mentally."[28] He concluded that her mental issues may explain her actions and "she may not [have] deliberately intend[ed] to injure other people."[29]

  

The Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors, in its Resolution No. XX-2013-848,[30] dated June 22, 2013, adopted and approved the report and recommendation of the Commissioner.

  

While we adopt the findings of fact of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, we do not believe that a mere reprimand is enough to punish Atty. Ramirez for her actions.

  

As this court stated in Bernardo v. Atty. Mejia:[31]

  

[T]he practice of law is a privilege burdened with conditions. Adherence to the rigid standards of mental fitness, maintenance of the highest degree of morality and faithful compliance with the rules of the legal profession are the continuing requirements for enjoying the privilege to practice law.[32]

  

A lawyer may be suspended or disbarred from the practice of law for gross misconduct. Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court provides:

  

Sec. 27. Disbarment or suspension of attorneys by Supreme Court, grounds therefore. — A member of the bar may be disbarred or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before the admission to practice, or for a wilful disobedience appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do. The practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of gain, either personally or through paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice.

  

Lawyers should treat everyone with kindness and respect, whether they are colleagues, members of the court, or the public in general. Anything less would be conduct unbecoming of one in the legal profession.

  

In Tapucar v. Atty. Tapucar:[33]

  

As this Court often reminds members of the Bar, they must live up to the standards and norms expected of the legal profession, by upholding the ideals and tenets embodied in the Code of Professional Responsibility always. Lawyers must maintain a high standard of legal proficiency, as well as morality including honesty, integrity and fair dealing. For they are at all times subject to the scrutinizing eye of public opinion and community approbation. Needless to state, those whose conduct — both public and private —fails this scrutiny would have to be disciplined and, after appropriate proceedings, penalized accordingly.[34] (Emphasis supplied)

  

As a lawyer, Atty. Ramirez is sworn to uphold not only her oath but also the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Rule 7.03 of Canon 7 states:

  

CANON 7 - A LAWYER SHALL AT ALL TIMES UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND DIGNITY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INTEGRATED BAR.

  

Rule 7.03 - A lawyer shall not engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law, nor shall he, whether in public or private life, behave in a scandalous manner to the discredit of the legal profession.

  

Instead of answering the allegations concerning her rude and disrespectful attitude, Atty. Ramirez haughtily asked the Integrated Bar of the Philippines to dismiss the complaint because complainants were not her equal, referring to them as "clerk, janitor, and maintenance man,"[35] respectively. Worse, she flaunted her credentials,[36] believing that being a former government lawyer allows her to disregard the tenets of her profession.

  

Her arrogance manifests her lack of moral fitness to practice law. Her disrespect toward her neighbors and toward complainants shows a blatant disregard to the dignity and integrity of the legal profession. Atty. Ramirez's actions do her profession a disservice and, as such, a penalty higher than a reprimand is in order.

  

"The rule is settled that a lawyer may be suspended or disbarred for any misconduct, even if it pertains to his private activities, as long as it shows him to be wanting in moral character, honesty, probity or good demeanor."[37] Taking into account her advanced age and her "alleged mental issues,"[38] we find that the appropriate penalty is suspension for six (6) months from the practice of law.

  

WHEREFORE, Atty. Perla D. Ramirez, having been found in violation of Canon 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months, with a stern warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.

  

Let a copy of this resolution be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant to be entered into respondent's records as attorney. Copies shall likewise be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned. (Villarama, Jr., J., designated Acting Member in view of the vacancy in the Third Division per Special Order No. 1691 dated May 22, 2014.)

  

SO ORDERED."

  

Very truly yours,
