Enrique A. Zaldivar
v.
SP Raul M. Gonzalez

This case starts in a legal battle between Enrique A. Zaldivar and Tanod-bayan Raul M. Gonzalez. Which led to allegations of misconduct and contempt.

Zaldivar is a defendant in a criminal case for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.  In a petition, he questioned the validity of the criminal informations filed against him, and the authority of Gonzalez. The Supreme Court in response to Zaldivar’s petition, issued a TRO preventing Gonzalez from acting further in the case. Eventually, the Court rendered a decision, nullifying the criminal information filed against Zaldivar. And ordered Gonzalez to cease and desist from further investigations and filings. This led Gonzalez to submit a Motion for Reconsideration of the Court’s decision, and public allegations of interference by members of the Court in his investigations. The Court then required Gonzalez to explain the public statements that were contemptuous and disrespectful of the Court. With doubts on the Court’s impartiality, Gonzalez submitted his explanation that present following.

Issues:

That his statements and actions were made in good faith and in the course of performing his duties as Tanodbayan. Emphasizing that there was no malice or intent to undermine the authority of the Court. 

That he had a legal obligation to investigate and prosecute cases of graft and corruption. And the requested inhibition of certain Justices from the case should not be viewed as disrespectful.

That his public statements were merely expressions of his legal opinions. And had the right to express those opinions, especially in the context of legal and public discourse.

Decision:

Gonzalez's defenses and arguments are firmly rejected. The Court Resolved to SUSPEND Atty. Raul M. Gonzalez from the practice of law indefinitely and until further orders from this Court, the suspension to take effect immediately.

The Court did acknowledge his duty to investigate and prosecute graft and corruption cases, but this duty must be exercised within the bounds of the law and with due respect for judicial authority. 

The right to free speech and the expression of legal opinions are not absolute. Statements made in a manner that disrespects the judiciary or impugns the integrity of the Court are subject to contempt. And Gonzalez's public statements were not merely legal opinions but were intended to challenge and undermine the authority of the Court. On the lack of intent to disrespect. Unser Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, intent is not a necessary element in contempt. What matters is whether the act or statement had a tendency to disrespect or undermine the authority of the Court. 

The request for the inhibition of certain Justices is baseless and unjustified. Such request must be supported by solid evidence of bias or prejudice, which Gonzalez failed to provide. 

RA 6713 and Article VIII of the Constitution asserts the Court's authority and jurisdiction over matters involving the conduct of public officials in relation to the judiciary.Any notion that the statements were protected by judicial immunity is rejected. Immunity applies to judges and certain actions taken in official capacity but does not protect actions that are in contempt.
