Cabarroguis v. Basa

The subject of this case is a complaint by Atty.  Cabarroguis against Atty. Basa. A complaint focused on the alleged unethical and retaliatory conduct of Basa to discredit and harrass Cabarroguis.

Cabarroguis points out dilatory tactics during the trial of an estafa case filed by his client against Basa's sister. Apart from receiving Retaliatory cases filings for his involvement, a consecutive inhibitions by presiding judges has led to a delay of the case, this is said to be a doing of Basa. That there is unprofessional behavior by Basa, a mockery by repeatedly misspelling  Cabarroguis' first name in documents.  And as an effort to discredit Cabarroguis, Basa alleggedly gathered and used the court's database records, this is argued to be a violation of Cabarroguis' right to privacy.

Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Board of Governors (IBP-BOG) initially found Atty. Basa guilty of ethical misconduct, recommending his suspension from the practice of law for one year based on the conclusion that Basa breached his ethical duties under Canon 8 of the CPR. Basa was deemed to have employed harassing and annoying tactics, which included filing multiple cases  against Cabarroguis. However, after both parties filed motions for reconsideration, the IBP-BOG reversed this decision in, finding no evidence of bad faith on the part of Basa. The IBP-BOG noted that 'some' of the cases filed were substantiated, and the sheer number of cases did not automatically imply bad faith. They emphasized that bad faith cannot be inferred solely based on the number of cases filed, especially since each act of alleged falsification could constitute a separate cause of action.

Issue:
Did the IBP correctly dismiss the complaint against Atty. Basa?

Decision:

The Supreme Court reversed the findings of the IBP-BOG favoring Basa and reinstated their earlier resolution. 

Basa misspelled Cabarroguis's first name, "Honesto," as "HONESTo," with the last letter in lowercase. This misspelling was consistently repeated throughout the 14-page motion. The Court considered this action to be a subtle form of name-calling, intended to ridicule and offend Atty. Cabarroguis. Although the misspelling might have been dismissed as a mere mistake in a private communication, the Court noted that the Omnibus Motion was part of a public record, making the action more egregious.

Lawyers are obligated to avoid filing groundless, false, or unlawful suits and must advise their clients accordingly if their cases lack merit. The Court highlighted  four separate complaints with the same underlying cause of action, all of which were dismissed. Cases that included allegations of falsification and other charges were found to be without basis. Seen as a reckless pursuit despite knowing they lacked merit. The conduct harms the administration of justice  and shows a lack of respect and courtesy toward a professional colleague

Basa guilty of violating the Lawyer's Oath and the following provisions of the CPR.
