Enrico Velasco
vs.
Atty. Berteni C. Causing

The subject in this case is a social media activity (Facebook)relating to an ongoing court case by Atty. Causing, which led to an alleged violation of Code of Professional Responsibility.

Atty. Causing is accused of breaching the rule on the privacy and confidentiality of Family Court proceedings by publicly posting a copy of Enrico Velasco's petition in a nullity case which contain sensitive details.
    
The Facebook post contained derogatory and offensive language, including terms like "polygamous," "criminal," "dishonest," and "cheater," in reference to Enrico Velasco. Causing defended his actions by claiming that he was exercising his rights to freedom of expression and of the press, and that he was acting as a "spokesman-lawyer" for his client. However, the complaint argued that these defenses did not justify his actions, especially given his responsibilities as a lawyer.

On this allegation, the IBP Investigating Commissioner initially found that Causing breached the rule on the privacy and confidentiality of Family Court proceedings by publishing a Facebook post that included photographs of the complete copy of Enrico Velasco's petition. This act violated Section 12 of RA 8369 - the Family Courts Act, which prohibits the publication or disclosure of the records of Family Court cases. It is also determined that Atty. Causing used language that was abusive, offensive, and improper. Reffering to Velasco with terms such as "polygamous," "criminal," "dishonest," "arrogance," "disgusting," and "cheater,"  violates Rule 8.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR)- a lawyer's language, even if forceful and emphatic, must always be dignified and respectful.


And recommended that Atty. Causing be suspended from the practice of law for one year. 

The IBP concluded that Atty. Causing made public statements in his Facebook post that were designed to arouse negative public opinion against Velasco. This was seen as a violation of Canon 13, Rule 13.02 of the CPR, which prohibits lawyers from making public statements in the media regarding a pending case that could influence public opinion for or against a party. It is not aligned with the ethical obligation to employ only fair and honest means in representing a client, as required by Rule 19.01. It was seen as an attempt to gain an improper advantage for his client by maligning the character of Velasco publicly.
    
Issue:

The Supreme Court ultimately needs to determine if Atty. Causing's conduct constitutes a breach of professional ethics:

Causing's actions in publishing the Facebook post violated the privacy and confidentiality rules applicable to Family Court proceedings. An were inappropriate and violated the ethical standards expected of a lawyer under the CPR.

Causing's defense that he was exercising his constitutional rights to freedom of expression and of the press, and acting as a "spokesman-lawyer" and "journalist-blogger".

Decision:

RA 8369 Section 12 prohibits the publication or disclosure, in any manner, of the records of Family Court cases. Atty. Causing violated this provision by posting the petition in a nullity case on Facebook.

The CPR's Canon 1 states that a lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, and promote respect for law and legal processes.

In Rule 8.01, a lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language that is abusive, offensive, or otherwise improper. Atty. Causing was found to have used derogatory language in his Facebook post.

Canon 13 states that a lawyer shall rely upon the merits of his cause and refrain from any impropriety which tends to influence or gives the appearance of influencing the court. And that Rule 13.02 prohibits public statements in the media regarding a pending case tending to arouse public opinion for or against a party.

While  Causing had the right to defend his client zealously, he is still bound by the ethical standards of the legal profession. Canon 19 requires a lawyer to represent his client with zeal within the bounds of the law. Causing's actions were designed to create a negative public opinion against Velasco, which violated this rule.

Causing was SUSPENDED from the practice of law for a period of one year, and received a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same will be dealt with more severely.
