#### Case Background and Parties Involved

- The case involves a dispute between Jose Y. Sonza, a television and radio personality, and ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (ABS-CBN).
- Sonza filed a complaint against ABS-CBN for non-payment of salaries, benefits, and other amounts due to him.
- ABS-CBN argued that Sonza was not an employee but an independent contractor.

#### The Control Test and Determining an Employer-Employee Relationship

The court applied the control test, which is the most important element in determining an employer-employee relationship:

1. ABS-CBN did not exercise control over the means and methods of Sonza's work.
2. Sonza had the freedom to perform his services according to his own style.
3. ABS-CBN could not dictate the contents of Sonza's script, and he was not required to work a fixed number of hours per day.

The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, which upheld the National Labor Relations Commission's (NLRC) ruling dismissing the case filed by Jose "Jay" Sonza for lack of jurisdiction. The court ruled that Sonza was an independent contractor and not an employee of ABS-CBN, meaning that the Labor Arbiter had no jurisdiction over his claims.

**Governing Laws and Principles:**

Labor Law - Employer-Employee Relationship:
The court examined the elements of an employer-employee relationship, which include: (a) selection and engagement of the employee, (b) payment of wages, (c) power of dismissal, and (d) the employerâ€™s power to control the employee on the means and methods by which the work is accomplished.

**Contract Law:**
The Agreement between Sonza and ABS-CBN, which outlined Sonza's role, payment terms, and exclusivity, was scrutinized to determine if it constituted an employment contract or an independent contractor agreement.

**On Policy Instruction No. 40:**
Sonza argued that Policy Instruction No. 40, issued by the Ministry of Labor, classified workers in the broadcast industry as either station or program employees. The court, however, found that this instruction did not have the force of law and was not binding in this case.
