#### Case Background and Parties Involved

- The case involves a dispute between Jose Y. Sonza, a television and radio personality, and ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (ABS-CBN).
- Sonza filed a complaint against ABS-CBN for non-payment of salaries, benefits, and other amounts due to him.
- ABS-CBN argued that Sonza was not an employee but an independent contractor.

#### The Control Test and Determining an Employer-Employee Relationship

- The court applied the control test, which is the most important element in determining an employer-employee relationship.
- The control test looks at the extent of control the hirer exercises over the worker.
- The court found that ABS-CBN did not exercise control over the means and methods of Sonza's work.
- Sonza had the freedom to perform his services according to his own style.
- ABS-CBN could not dictate the contents of Sonza's script, and he was not required to work a fixed number of hours per day.

#### Other Factors Considered by the Court

- The court also considered other factors, such as the selection and engagement of Sonza, the payment of his talent fees directly to him, and the power of dismissal.
- Sonza's unique skills, talent, and celebrity status were the reasons why ABS-CBN engaged his services.
- The payment of talent fees directly to Sonza and the absence of the power of dismissal supported the finding that he was an independent contractor.

#### Rejection of Sonza's Arguments

- The court rejected Sonza's argument that ABS-CBN's control over his work, such as supplying equipment and crew, and subjecting him to rules and standards of performance, indicated an employer-employee relationship.
- The court held that these factors did not amount to control over the means and methods of Sonza's work but were merely guidelines to achieve the desired result of top-rating television and radio programs.

#### Dismissal of Claim Regarding Right to Security of Tenure

- The court dismissed Sonza's claim that ABS-CBN's practice of treating talents as independent contractors violated the right to security of tenure.
