At hand is a case in need of determination of whether Angelina Francisco was an employee of Kasei Corporation and whether she was constructively dismissed from her position.

Angelina Francisco claimed that she was an employee of Kasei Corporation, initially hired as an Accountant and Corporate Secretary and later designated as Acting Manager. Over time, she took on various roles, including handling accounting, recruitment, management functions, and liaison work for government permits.

Kasei Corporation, on the other hand, argued that Francisco was not an employee but a technical consultant hired on a temporary basis. They claimed that she worked independently, without supervision or control from the company, and was compensated with a professional fee rather than a salary.

The Labor Arbiter found in favor of Francisco, and ordered her reinstatement with back wages and other benefits. NLRC affirmed this with some modifications, but maintaining her status as an employee. However, the Court of Appeals reversed the NLRC's decision  and ruled that she was not an employee of Kasei Corporation. 

- She performed her work independently, without the control or supervision typically associated with an employer-employee relationship. 
- The compensation she received was in the form of professional fees, subject to a 10% expanded withholding tax, this indicates that she was treated as a contractor.
- She is not listed in the company's payroll records or reported to the BIR and SSS as an employee. 

Decision:

The Supreme Court granted the petition of Francisco. The Court applied the "two-tiered test" to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship:

- **Control Test**: The court found that Francisco was under the direct control and supervision of Kasei Corporation, particularly by Seiji Kamura, the corporation’s Technical Consultant. She was assigned various tasks and positions over the years, indicating that the corporation exercised control over the means and methods of her work, which is the primary indicator of an employer-employee relationship.
- **Economic Reality Test**: The court noted that Francisco was economically dependent on Kasei Corporation, having worked there for several years and received compensation in the form of salaries, bonuses, and benefits. Her work was integral to the corporation’s operations, further supporting the existence of an employer-employee relationship.

The Supreme Court rejected the Consultant Argument, as evidence showed that she was paid regular compensation, included in the SSS, and performed essential duties for the corporation over an extended period. The court also noted that her role went beyond that of an independent contractor.
