#### Parties Involved and Background Information

- Petitioner: Oscar Villamaria, Jr.
- Owner of Villamaria Motors, a sole proprietorship that assembled passenger jeepneys.
- Retained nine jeepneys, four of which were operated by drivers on a "boundary basis."
- Respondent: Jerry V. Bustamante
- One of the drivers employed by Villamaria on a "boundary basis."
- Drove the jeepney with Plate No. PVU-660.
- Remitted P450.00 a day to Villamaria as a boundary and kept the rest of his daily earnings as compensation for driving the vehicle.

#### Agreement and Contract

- In August 1997, Villamaria verbally agreed to sell the jeepney to Bustamante under the "boundary-hulog scheme."
- Under this scheme, Bustamante would remit P550.00 a day to Villamaria for four years.
- After four years, Bustamante would become the owner of the vehicle and continue to drive it under Villamaria's franchise.
- Bustamante made a downpayment of P10,000.00.
- On August 7, 1997, Villamaria executed a contract entitled "Kasunduan ng Bilihan ng Sasakyan sa Pamamagitan ng Boundary-Hulog" over the jeepney.
- The contract stated that if Bustamante failed to pay the boundary-hulog for three days, Villamaria Motors would hold on to the vehicle until Bustamante paid his arrears.
- If Bustamante failed to remit the daily boundary-hulog for a week, the contract would cease to have legal effect and Bustamante would have to return the vehicle to Villamaria Motors.
- The contract also included various conditions and obligations for Bustamante, such as displaying an identification card, paying for any lost or damaged parts, notifying Villamaria Motors of any repairs, and following certain rules and regulations for the upkeep and maintenance of the jeepney.

#### Failure to Pay and Termination

- Bustamante continued driving the jeepney and made daily remittances of P550.00 as agreed upon.
- However, in 1999, Bustamante and other drivers who had similar arrangements with Villamaria Motors failed to pay their respective boundary-hulog.
- Villamaria served a "Paalala" reminding them of the consequences of not paying the daily boundary-hulog.
- On July 24, 2000, Villamaria took back the jeepney driven by Bustamante and barred him from driving the vehicle.
- Bustamante filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against Villamaria and his wife Teresita.

#### Initial Ruling and Reversal

- The Labor Arbiter initially dismissed Bustamante's complaint, ruling that the Kasunduan transformed the employer-employee relationship into that of vendor-vendee.
- The Court of Appeals reversed this decision, ruling that the relationship between the parties was both that of vendor-vendee and employer-employee.
- The court held that Villamaria's exercise of control over Bustamante's conduct as a driver was inconsistent with his claim that he was not engaged in the transportation business.
- The court also found that Bustamante was illegally dismissed and ordered Villamaria
