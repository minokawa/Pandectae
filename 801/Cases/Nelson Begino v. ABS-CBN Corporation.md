The case involves a dispute between ABS-CBN Corporation and its employees(Begino,Del Valle, Sumayao) who claim to be regular employees entitled to benefits. ABS-CBN argues that they are independent contractors.

The petitioners were engaged by ABS-CBN as cameramen/editors and reporters for the TV Patrol Bicol Program hired through Talent Contracts. The contracts specified the duration of the project, budget, and daily technical requirements. They were paid talent fees and subjected to contractor's tax but no labor standard benefits.


The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of the employees, declaring them as regular employees. The NLRC affirmed the decision.
However, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision, ruling no employer-employee relationship.

Decision:

The Supreme Court reversed and set aside the Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals, reinstating the Decision of the NLRC. 

The petitioners, who were cameramen/editors and reporters, were regular employees of ABS-CBN despite their contracts being labeled as "Talent Contracts" or "Project Assignment Forms." The Court held that the petitioners were performing tasks essential to ABS-CBN’s business and were subject to the control and supervision of the company, fulfilling the requirements of an employer-employee relationship.


    
**Article 280 of the Labor Code of the Philippines**: This article provides the legal basis for determining whether an employment relationship is regular, project-based, seasonal, or casual. The Supreme Court applied this law to conclude that petitioners were regular employees, as their work was necessary and desirable for ABS-CBN's business, and they were repeatedly rehired over the years.


The Court examined whether the fixed-term contracts were used to prevent petitioners from acquiring regular employee status. The nature of the work performed by the petitioners, which was integral to ABS-CBN’s business, indicated that they were regular employees rather than independent contractors or project employees. Found by applying the "four-fold test" to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship.
 - Selection and engagement of the employee
 - Payment of wages
 - Power of dismissal
 - Power of control over the employee’s conduct, particularly the manner and means by which the work is accomplished.
 
The Court distinguished the petitioners' case from that of Sonza, where a television personality was considered an independent contractor, emphasizing that petitioners were ordinary employees performing regular functions necessary to ABS-CBN’s operations.
