GR. No. 182836               October 13, 2009
CHICO-NAZARIO J,
CONTINENTAL STEEL MANUFACTURING CORPOR,Petitioner,  
vs.  
HON. ACCREDITED VOLUNTARY ARBITRATOR ALLAN S. MONTAÑO and NAGKAKAISANG MANGGAGAWA NG CENTRO STEEL CORPORATION-SOLIDARITY OF UNIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES FOR EMPOWERMENT AND REFORMS (NMCSC-SUPER), Respondents.

Hortillano, an employee of petitioner Continental Steel Manufacturing Corporation, filed on a claim for Paternity Leave, Bereavement Leave and Death and Accident Insurance for dependent. Upon the death of his unborn child. Hortillano’s wife, Marife, had a premature delivery while she was in the 38th week of pregnancy.

According to the Certificate of Fetal Death, the female fetus died during labor due to fetal Anoxia secondary to uteroplacental insufficiency. Continental granted Hortillano’s claim for paternity leave but denied his claims for bereavement leave and other death benefits.

Seeking the reversal of the denial by Continental Hortillano’s Union resorted to the grievance machinery provided in the CBA. The Union and Continental submitted for voluntary arbitration the sole issue of whether Hortillano was entitled to bereavement leave and other death benefits. The Union argued for the entitlement to bereavement leave and other death benefits and maintained that the CBA did not specifically state that the dependent should have first been born alive or must have acquired juridical personality.

Continental Steel posited that the CBA did not contemplate the death of an unborn child. Relying on Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Civil Code, they contended that only one with civil personality could die. The unborn child never died as juridical personality is not  acquired along with the right to be supported. Hence,  could not be considered a dependent.

Atty. Montaño, the appointed Accredited Voluntary Arbitrator, issued a Resolution in favor of Hortillano. Reasoning that the fetus had the right to be supported by the parents from the very moment he/she was conceived. Therefore, the fetus was already a dependent despite the death during the delivery. 


Continental claimed that Atty. Montaño erred in granting Hortillano’s claims because no death of an employee’s dependent had occurred. The CBA contemplates the death of a legal person, and not of a fetus, which did not acquire  juridical personality. The Court of Appeals was not persuaded by this argument and affirmed Atty. Montaño’s Resolution.  While there is no arguing with Continental Steel that the acquisition of civil personality of a child or fetus is conditioned on being born alive upon delivery, it does not follow that such event of premature delivery of a fetus could never be contemplated as a "death".  


Similarly the Supreme Court is not persuaded. The reliance of Continental on Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Civil Code for the legal definition of death is misplaced. 

> Art. 40. Birth determines personality; but the conceived child shall be considered born for all purposes that are favorable to it, provided it be born later with the conditions specified in the following article. (29a)
> 
> Art. 41. For civil purposes, the fetus is considered born if it is alive at the time it is completely delivered from the mother's womb. However, if the fetus had an intra-uterine life of less than seven months, it is not deemed born if it dies within twenty-four hours after its complete delivery from the maternal womb. (30a)
> 
> Art. 42. Civil personality is extinguished by death.

First, the issue of civil personality is not relevant herein. Articles 40, 41 and 42 of the Civil Code on natural persons, must be applied in relation to Article 37 of the same Code:

> Art. 37. Juridical capacity, which is the fitness to be the subject of legal relations, is inherent in every natural person and is lost only through death. Capacity to act, which is the power to do acts with legal effect, is acquired and may be lost.

Civil personality of the unborn child  and his/her juridical capacity and capacity to act as a person are not in issue. The rights to bereavement leave and other death benefits in the instant case pertain directly to the parents of the unborn child upon the latter’s death.

Second, while the Civil Code expressly provides that civil personality may be extinguished by death, it does not explicitly state that only those who have acquired juridical personality could die.

And third, death has been defined as the cessation of life. Life is not synonymous with civil personality. One need not acquire civil personality first before he/she could die. The cessation thereof even prior to the child being delivered qualifies as death. Likewise, the unborn child can be considered a dependent. The CBA did not provide a qualification for the child dependent, without such, the child shall be understood in its more general sense, which includes the unborn.


The Petition is **DENIED**.
