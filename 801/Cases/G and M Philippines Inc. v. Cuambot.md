- Romil V. Cuambot, a car body builder, filed a complaint against his employer, G & M Philippines, Inc., for unpaid wages and illegal dismissal.
- Cuambot had been deployed to Saudi Arabia by G & M Philippines, Inc. but returned to the Philippines after six months.
- Cuambot sought unpaid wages, withheld salaries, refund of plane ticket and repatriation bond, damages, and attorney's fees.

#### Cuambot's Allegations

- Cuambot claimed inhuman working conditions, including long hours of work and non-payment of salary and overtime pay.
- He alleged that his employer, Mohd Al Motairi, insulted him and withheld letters from his family.
- Cuambot submitted various documents, including letters and fax messages, to support his claims.

#### G & M Philippines, Inc.'s Defense

- G & M Philippines, Inc. argued that Cuambot voluntarily resigned and was paid his salaries as they fell due.
- They presented authenticated copies of payslips as evidence of payment.
- They claimed that Cuambot should pay for his plane ticket since he did not complete his contract.

#### Adjudication Process

- The Labor Arbiter ruled in favor of Cuambot and ordered G & M Philippines, Inc. to pay him unpaid salaries and benefits.
- The NLRC reversed the decision and remanded the case for calligraphy examination of the questioned documents.
- The Labor Arbiter dismissed the case for lack of merit, but the NLRC upheld the earlier decision.
- Cuambot appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA), which reinstated the Labor Arbiter's decision.
- The CA found significant differences in Cuambot's handwriting in the questioned documents, indicating they were not forged.
- G & M Philippines, Inc. failed to produce the original copies of the documents, raising doubts about their authenticity.

The Supreme Court **denied** the petition and **affirmed** the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 64744. The Supreme Court found that the G&M failed to prove that the Cuambot's signatures on the questioned documents (such as the resignation letter and pay slips) were genuine. The Court ruled that Labor Arbiter Enrico Portillo gravely abused his discretion by not following the directive of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) to refer the documents for a proper calligraphy examination by experts. Instead, Portillo ruled in favor of the G&M without sufficient basis.

The Court also emphasized that doubts arising from the failure to produce original documents and the inconsistencies in the signatures must be resolved in favor of the Cuambot, aligning with the policy of the State to protect labor. As a result, the Supreme Court concluded that the Cuambot was illegally dismissed, and the G&M's claim that the Cuambot voluntarily resigned was not substantiated.
