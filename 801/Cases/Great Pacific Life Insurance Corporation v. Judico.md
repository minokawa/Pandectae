Honorato Judico worked as a "debit agent" for Grepalife, and the issue is the nature of his work status. Knowing if he is an employee of the company or merely an agent is crucial to determines whether he is entitled to the benefits and protections provided by the Labor Code, including claims for illegal dismissal, separation pay, and other benefits.

Judico's claim of illegal dismissal against Grepalife was dissmissed at arbitration, as the LA deemed that there is no employer-employee relationship. NLRC reversed the decision and ordered Grepalife to recognize Judico as a regular employee.

This issue is brought before the Supreme COurt which agreed with the NLRC. That Honorato Judico was a regular employee of Great Pacific Life Assurance Corporation (Grepalife) and, therefore, entitled to the protections and benefits under the Labor Code.

Decision:

The crux of the determination lies in the "control test," where the court examines whether Grepalife had control over not just the results of Judico's work but also the means and methods by which the work was accomplished. The presence of control indicates an employer-employee relationship.

> Judico received a definite minimum amount per week as his wage known as "sales reserve" wherein the failure to maintain the same would bring him back to a beginner's employment with a fixed weekly wage of P 200.00 for thirteen weeks regardless of production. He was assigned a definite place in the office to work on when he is not in the field; and in addition to his canvassing work he was burdened with the job of collection. In both cases he was required to make regular report to the company regarding these duties, and for which an anemic performance would mean a dismissal.

**Article 295 LC** defines regular employment and states that **an employee is considered regular if they are engaged in activities that are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer.**
