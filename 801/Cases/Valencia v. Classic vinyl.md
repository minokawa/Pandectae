A dispute resting on employer-employee relationship. involving a manpower service.

Valencia claimed that he was employed by Classique Vinyl through Cantingas Manpower Services (CMS), which he alleged was merely a labor-only contractor. He argued that CMS was not a legitimate contractor, and therefore, Classique Vinyl should be considered his actual employer. Classique Vinyl denied this, asserting that CMS was responsible for his employment and that Valencia's work was under CMS’s control.

Valencia’s claims included illegal dismissal, underpayment of salary, overtime pay, holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, 13th-month pay, and other monetary benefits. He also sought moral and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees. He contested the validity of the employment contract with CMS, citing issues like lack of notarization and incomplete entries. Classique Vinyl, on the other hand, maintained that CMS was responsible for the terms of employment and payment of wages.

Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) found that there was no employer-employee relationship between Valencia and Classique Vinyl, dismissing the claims against it. They noted that CMS was responsible for employment-related issues and that Valencia’s deployment to Classique Vinyl was intermittent and limited. The Court of Appeals upheld the NLRC's decision, concluding that there was no error in finding that Classique Vinyl was not Valencia’s employer and that CMS was a legitimate contractor.

The Supreme Court affirmed the decisions of the lower tribunals, ruling that the findings of fact by the Labor Arbiter, NLRC, and Court of Appeals were correct. Valencia failed to prove an employer-employee relationship with Classique Vinyl and did not provide sufficient evidence for his monetary claims.

The core issue was whether Valencia’s relationship with Classique Vinyl constituted employment or if CMS was the true employer. The Supreme Court's ruling affirmed that CMS was the legitimate employer, dismissing Valencia's claims against Classique Vinyl.

The Supreme Court's rationale for denying Valencia's Petition for Review on Certiorari and affirming the Court of Appeals' decision centered on several key points:

**Employer-Employee Relationship:** The Court emphasized that determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship is a factual issue. It noted that factual findings of labor tribunals are generally binding and not subject to review by the Supreme Court unless there are clear errors. The Court upheld the lower tribunals' finding that there was no direct employer-employee relationship between Valencia and Classique Vinyl.
    
**Burden of Proof:** Valencia, as the petitioner claiming employment, had the burden of proving that he was indeed an employee of Classique Vinyl. The Court found that Valencia failed to present substantial evidence to establish this relationship. His evidence was insufficient to prove that Classique Vinyl was his true employer.
    
**Employment Contract with CMS:** The Court found that the employment contract Valencia signed with CMS was valid and significant in establishing that CMS was his employer. The lack of notarization and incomplete entries in the contract were not seen as affecting its validity, especially since Valencia did not deny signing it.
    
**Payment of Wages and Control:** Valencia’s claims about his work being supervised by Classique Vinyl were considered self-serving and unsupported by evidence. The Court noted that the employment contract with CMS indicated that CMS had control over Valencia's employment and dismissal, which negated the claim of Classique Vinyl being his employer.
    
**Legitimacy of CMS:** Although CMS’s status as a legitimate contractor was contested, the Court acknowledged that CMS was registered and had the necessary credentials. The Court found no evidence of circumvention of labor laws by Classique Vinyl and concluded that CMS’s registration prevented the presumption of it being a labor-only contractor from arising.
    
**No Illegal Dismissal or Monetary Claims:** Since the Court found no employer-employee relationship between Valencia and Classique Vinyl, the issues of illegal dismissal and monetary claims were moot. The Court affirmed that Valencia’s claims against Classique Vinyl were unfounded.
