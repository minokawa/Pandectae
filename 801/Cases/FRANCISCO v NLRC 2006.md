on economic dependence test to establish employer-employee relation
## Using Analogy to Foreign Laws to provide benchmarks


FRANCISCO v NLRC 2006

Issue:
petitioner was hired by Kasei Corporation during its incorporation stage. She was designated as Accountant and Corporate Secretary and was assigned to handle all the accounting needs of the company. She was also designated as Liaison Officer to the City of Makati to secure business permits, construction permits and other licenses for the initial operation of the company. As technical consultant, petitioner performed her work at her own discretion without control and supervision of Kasei Corporation. Petitioner had no daily time record and she came to the office any time she wanted. The company never interfered with her work except that from time to time, the management would ask her opinion on matters relating to her profession. Petitioner did not go through the usual procedure of selection of employees, but her services were engaged through a Board Resolution designating her as technical consultant

## RATIO
Court  held in _Sevilla v. Court of Appeals_ [18](https://lawphil.net/judjuris/juri2006/aug2006/gr_170087_2006.html#fnt18) that in this jurisdiction, there has been no uniform test to determine the existence of an employer-employee relation. 


Generally, courts have relied on the so-called right of control test: 

Where the person for whom the services are performed ==reserves a right to control== not only the end to be achieved but also the means to be used in reaching such end. 

In certain cases the control test is not sufficient to give a complete picture of the relationship between the parties, owing to the complexity of such a relationship where several positions have been held by the worker.

Thus, the determination of the relationship between employer and employee depends upon the circumstances of the whole economic activity, such as:
- (1) the extent to which the services performed are an integral part of the employer’s business; 
- (2) the extent of the worker’s investment in equipment and facilities; 
- (3) the nature and degree of control exercised by the employer; 
- (4) the worker’s opportunity for profit and loss; 
- (5) the amount of initiative, skill, judgment or foresight required for the success of the claimed independent enterprise; 
- (6) the permanency and duration of the relationship between the worker and the employer; and 
- (7) the degree of dependency of the worker upon the employer for his continued employment in that line of business.

The proper standard of economic dependence is whether the worker is dependent on the alleged employer for his continued employment in that line of business. 

In the United States, the touchstone of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Federal Labor Standards Act is dependency. By analogy, the benchmark of economic reality in analyzing possible employment relationships for purposes of the Labor Code ought to be the ==economic dependence of the worker on his employer==.

By applying the control test, there is no doubt that petitioner is an employee of Kasei Corporation because she was under the direct control and supervision of Seiji Kamura, the corporation’s Technical Consultant. She reported for work regularly and served in various capacities as Accountant, Liaison Officer, Technical Consultant, Acting Manager and Corporate Secretary, with substantially the same job functions, that is, rendering accounting and tax services to the company and performing functions necessary and desirable for the proper operation of the corporation such as securing business permits and other licenses over an indefinite period of engagement.
