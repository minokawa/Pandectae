The dispute in this case revolves around the claims of two employees, Jenny and Virgilio Agabon, who were allegedly dismissed by their employer, Riviera Home Improvements, Inc. The key points of contention are:

Agabon assert that they were dismissed because they refused to work on a "pakyaw" basis, which would have resulted in the loss of their Social Security System (SSS) benefits. They argue that their dismissal was improper due to the employer's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of notice and hearing.

Riviera contends that the petitioners were not dismissed but had instead abandoned their work. They argue that the petitioners were notified to report for work and were offered a new assignment. The petitioners, however, did not show up for work and had subcontracted their services to another company, which the employer claims demonstrates abandonment. The employer also notes that the petitioners demanded a wage increase, and when it was not granted, they ceased reporting for work and filed an illegal dismissal case.

The Court of Appeals, after reviewing the facts, found that the petitioners' dismissal was justified due to abandonment. The petitioners had not reported for work and had instead worked for another company, indicating a clear intention to sever the employment relationship. This abandonment was seen as a valid cause for termination.

Despite the dismissal being for a valid cause, the employer did not fully comply with the procedural requirements of due process. The Court found that while the dismissal was for a just cause, the employer failed to properly serve the required notices of dismissal. Therefore, the employer was held liable for not adhering to the statutory due process requirements.

Decision:


The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the dismissal of the petitioners, Jenny and Virgilio Agabon, based on abandonment of their work. They had indeed abandoned their employment as evidenced by their subcontracting to perform installation work for another company. This abandonment was deemed a just cause for termination.

Although the dismissal was upheld, the Court ruled that the employer failed to comply with the procedural due process requirements. Specifically, the private respondent did not follow the required twin notice procedures for dismissalâ€”providing a written notice of grounds for dismissal, an opportunity for the employee to be heard, and a final notice of termination.

The ruling emphasizes that under Article 282 of the Labor Code, an employer can terminate employment for just causes, including abandonment, which is defined as a deliberate and unjustified refusal to resume employment.

For dismissals based on just causes, the employer must observe the procedural due process requirements outlined in Book VI, Rule I, Section 2(d) of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code. This includes:

- A written notice specifying the grounds for termination and giving the employee a chance to explain their side.
- A hearing or conference to present evidence and respond to charges.
- A final written notice of termination after considering the circumstances.

Even if the dismissal is for a just cause, if due process is not followed, the employer must be liable for indemnification. The Court modified previous rulings by setting a nominal damages amount to deter procedural violations. Employers are required to pay statutory benefits such as holiday pay, service incentive leave pay, and 13th month pay as mandated by labor laws, without unauthorized deductions.
