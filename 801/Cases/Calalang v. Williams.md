In this case, Maximo Calalang, acting as a private citizen and taxpayer, filed a petition for a writ of prohibition against several government officials. The dispute revolves around the constitutionality and legality of regulations concerning the use of animal-drawn vehicles on certain streets in Manila.

The National Traffic Commission recommended and the Director of Public Works, with approval from the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, implemented regulations restricting animal-drawn vehicles from certain streets at specific times. This was in response to traffic congestion and safety concerns.

Calalang argued that Commonwealth Act No. 548, which allowed the Director of Public Works and the Secretary to issue such regulations, constituted an undue delegation of legislative power. He contended that it gave these officials legislative powers rather than merely administrative or executive functions.

He also claimed that the regulations interfered with legitimate business activities and personal freedoms, particularly affecting the owners of animal-drawn vehicles and the public relying on them.

 **Violation of Social Justice Principles**: Additionally, Calalang argued that the regulations infringed upon constitutional principles related to social justice, which should ensure economic security and fairness for all people.

**Court's Ruling on Social Justice:**

The court clarified that social justice is not about showing favoritism or sympathy toward any particular group. Rather, it is about the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces to promote the welfare of all individuals. Social justice involves creating a balanced and fair society where laws work toward the greater good of the population.
    
Commonwealth Act No. 548 and the regulations it authorized were aimed at promoting public welfare. The regulations were intended to manage traffic congestion and improve safety on national roads. These objectives align with the principles of social justice as they seek to protect public health and safety, which is beneficial for society as a whole.
    
The regulations, which restricted the movement of animal-drawn vehicles during certain hours and on specific roads, were justified by the need to alleviate traffic congestion and ensure safer road conditions. The measures were seen as necessary for the greater public interest, even if they imposed some limitations on the individual rights of vehicle owners.
