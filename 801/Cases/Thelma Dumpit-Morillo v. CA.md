Thelma Dumpit-Murillo is a newscaster and co-anchor for Balitang-Balita, under a contract that is repeatedly renewed totalling to a 4 year service. After the expiration of the last contract, she expressed interest in renewing but subject to salary increase. In the letter she stated that she will deem a non-response as a constructive dismissal of services. 

A month later she sent a  letter demanding reinstatement and  payment of unpaid wages. Thelma's claim was dismissed by the Labor Arbiter. The NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter decision and held that an employer-employee relationship existed between Thelma and ABC. ABC elevated the case to the Court of Appeals which ruled that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion and reversed their decision.  According to the CA, thelma was a fixed-term employee and not a regular employee. Based on the control ABC had over the Thelma's work, her wage payments, the power of dismissal, and the power to dictate work assignments. 


The Supreme Court recognized the employment relationship.
   
The petitioner's work was necessary and desirable to ABC's business, and that she had been performing her duties for a continuous period of four years. This established her as a regular employee under labor laws, which consider both the nature of the work and the duration of employment as grounds for regular status. The fixed-term employment contract was not valid because the period specified was imposed to prevent the petitioner from acquiring regular status. That for a fixed-term contract to be valid, it must be entered into voluntarily, without any force or duress, and on equal terms between the employer and employee.

The court set aside the Court of Appeals' decision and affirmed the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), recognizing the petitioner as a regular employee and holding that she was illegally dismissed. Consequently, the petitioner was entitled to the rights and protections afforded to regular employees, including security of tenure.

Elements of an employer-employee relationship as outlined in **Manila Water Company, Inc. v. Pena**.
The standards for determining regular employment, particularly the necessity and desirability of the employee's work in relation to the employer's business, as discussed in **Benares v. Pancho**.

Thelma a regular employee, she is entitled to security of tenure and can be dismissed only for just cause and after due compliance with procedural due process.
