#### Background of the Case

- Thelma Dumpit-Murillo was accused by the Career Executive Service Board (CESB) of Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document.
- The CESB recommended the denial of Dumpit-Murillo's eligibility for the Career Executive Service (CES) due to alleged false representations in her CES Personal Data Sheet (PDS).
- The false representations involved her claim of having a master's degree in National Security Administration (MNSA) from the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP) and being a candidate for a doctorate degree in Public Administration at the Eulogio "Amang" Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology.

#### Verification of Entries in Dumpit-Murillo's CES PDS

- The CESB requested a certification from the President of NDCP to verify the entries in Dumpit-Murillo's CES PDS.
- The President confirmed that Dumpit-Murillo was conferred the MNSA degree but failed to submit her final thesis in hardbound format, which was a requirement for the degree.
- The CESB argued that Dumpit-Murillo should be held administratively liable for Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document based on this information.

#### Dumpit-Murillo's Defense

- Dumpit-Murillo claimed that she did not declare herself as a "graduate" of NDCP with the MNSA degree but only stated the inclusive dates of her attendance.
- She argued that she could not be held liable for Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document because the General Order from NDCP conferred upon her the MNSA degree.
- Dumpit-Murillo maintained that she relied in good faith on the authenticity and veracity of the documents on hand.

#### Ombudsman's Decision and Appeal

- The Office of the Ombudsman (OMB) found Dumpit-Murillo guilty of Dishonesty and Falsification of a Public Document and imposed the penalty of dismissal from the service.
- Dumpit-Murillo filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.
- She then filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals (CA), which affirmed the OMB's decision.

#### Supreme Court's Decision

- Dumpit-Murillo appealed to the Supreme Court (SC) through a Petition for Review on Certiorari.
- The SC held that Dumpit-Murillo was not deprived of due process as she was given the opportunity to explain her side during the administrative proceedings.
- However, the SC did not find her guilty of Dishonesty
