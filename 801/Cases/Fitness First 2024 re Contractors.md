Contractors in employer-employee relationship  

#### Contractors: Four-fold and Economic dependence

Notably the employment status of a person is not defined by what the parties say it should be. Rather, the employment relationship of parties is prescribed **by law**.[65] When the status of the employment is in dispute, the employer bears the burden to prove that the person whose service it pays for is an independent contractor rather than a regular employee with or without fixed terms.[66] The rule is that where a person who works for another performs his or her job more or less at his or her own pleasure, in the manner he or she sees fit, not subject to definite hours or conditions of work, and is compensated according to the result of his or her efforts and not the amount thereof, no employer-employee relationship exists.

An **independent contractor** is one who carries on a distinct and independent business and undertakes to perform the job, work, or service on one's own account and under one's own responsibility according to one's own manner and method, free from the control and direction of the principal in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof.[68] The independent contractor consists of individuals who possess unique skills and talents which set them apart from ordinary employees and whose means and methods of work are free from the control of the employer. Under this arrangement, there is no trilateral relationship but a bilateral relationship because independent contractors are directly engaged by the principal.

An independent contractor enjoys independence and freedom from the control and supervision of his or her principal as opposed to an **employee** who is subject to the employer's power to control the means and methods by which the employee's work is to be performed and accomplished.[70]  
  
In the resolution of the issue, this Court will employ a two-tiered test: the four-fold test and the economic dependence test.

Under the **four-fold test**, to establish an employer-employee relationship, four factors must be proven:  

> (a) the employer's selection and engagement of the employee;  
> (b) the payment of wages;  
> (c) the power to dismiss; and  
> (d) the power to control the employee's conduct. The power of control is the most significant factor in the four-fold test.

Even applying the economic dependence test, the conclusion would be the same. _Francisco v. National Labor Relations Commission_ laid down the circumstances of the whole economic activity to consider in the determination of the relationship:  

1. extent to which the services performed are an integral part or the employer's business;
2. extent of the worker's investment in equipment and facilities;
3. nature and degree of control exercised by the employer;
4. worker's opportunity for profit and loss;
5. amount of initiative, skill, judgment, or foresight required for the success of the claimed independent enterprise; 
6. permanency and duration of the relationship between the worker and the employer; and
7. degree of dependency of the worker upon the employer for his continued employment in that line of business. 

Court find that petitioners are regular employees of respondent. Petitioners here did not perform their job at their own pleasure and in the manner they saw fit. Consequently, petitioners should be reinstated to their respective positions with full backwages computed from the time of dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement. These include their salary for holiday pay and other labor benefits withheld. If reinstatement is no longer feasible, they should be given separation pay in addition to full backwages.

## Exeption to being solidarily held liable with the corporation

While directors, officers, and human resource managers like respondent Cruz may be solidarily held liable with the corporation in cases of illegal termination of employees, this is the exception rather than the general rule. To be held solidarily liable with the corporation in labor cases, the manager or officer must have acted with **malice or bad faith**

**Governing Laws:**

The Court's disposition in this case gives true meaning to the right to security of tenure guaranteed under Article XIII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution:

> It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may he provided by law.


Labor Code echoes the right to security of tenure:

> **ARTICLE 294.** Security of Tenure. — In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss or seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive or allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.
