#### Case Background and Parties Involved

- The case of Bernarte v. Philippine Basketball Association involves a petition for review filed by basketball referee Jose Mel Bernarte.
- Bernarte was deemed an independent contractor by the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), resulting in the denial of his claim for illegal dismissal.

#### Facts of the Case

- Bernarte and another referee, Renato Guevarra, were invited to join the PBA as referees.
- They signed contracts on a year-to-year basis during the leadership of Commissioner Emilio Bernardino.
- Changes were made to their employment terms during the term of Commissioner Jose Emmanuel M. Eala.
- Bernarte was not made to sign a contract during the first conference of the All-Filipino Cup but was made to sign a one and a half month contract for the second conference.
- Guevarra signed a contract as a trainee in 2001 and a yearly contract as a Regular Class C referee starting in 2002.
