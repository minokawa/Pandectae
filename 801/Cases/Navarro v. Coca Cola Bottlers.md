The case involves the appeal of Alberto Navarro against his dismissal by Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. Navarro argues that his absence from work due to heavy rains and flooding should not have resulted in his termination and that it was excusable.


On August 11, 1997, Navarro did not report to work due to heavy rains and flooding in his barangay. He submitted a written explanation accompanied by a certification from his Barangay Captain, stating that his absence was due to the heavy rains and subsequent flooding.  Despite his compliance and explanation, Navarro was dismissed on February 27, 1998, and given a notice of termination that listed the dates of his absences without permission.

Navarro filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the Labor Arbiter, but it was dismissed for lack of merit. Navarro appealed to the NLRC, which reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and declared Navarro's dismissal illegal and ordered Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. to reinstate Navarro to his former position without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and to pay his full backwages, allowances, and other benefits.

Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils., Inc. appealed the NLRC's decision to the Court of Appeals, which annulled the NLRC's resolution.


The Supreme Court agreed with Navarro that his application for leave should have been approved by the company. A worker cannot be expected to anticipate times of sickness or emergencies and that requiring prior notice in such situations would be absurd. The  Court emphasized the State's policy of affording full protection to labor and balancing the conflicting interests of labor and capital.
