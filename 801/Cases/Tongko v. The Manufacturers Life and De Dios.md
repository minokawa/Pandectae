Tongko argued that despite the Agency Agreement stating otherwise, he was in fact an employee of Manulife. He claimed that he had an employment relationship based on his compensation structure, administrative duties, and the provision of office resources by Manulife. 

Manulife contended that Tongko was an independent agent, not an employee. They pointed out that Tongko’s compensation was commission-based, he declared himself as self-employed in tax returns.

The dispute went through conflicting rulings:

The Labor Arbiter, initially ruled that no employer-employee relationship existed between Tongko and Manulife. The NLRC reversed the Arbiter’s decision, finding that an employment relationship did exist and that Tongko had been illegally dismissed. Court of Appeals reverted to the Arbiter’s decision, ruling that no employer-employee relationship existed.


On the 2008 petition, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals, finding that an employer-employee relationship did exist between Tongko and Manulife.  The Court found that Manulife exercised sufficient control over Tongko’s work to establish an employment relationship. Evidence included Tongko’s adherence to company codes of conduct and administrative duties, as well as Manulife's control over his recruitment and management of agents. The Insurance Code and Civil Code governed the relationship between Manulife and Tongko. Despite the Agency Agreement characterizing Tongko as an independent agent, the Court looked at the actual nature of his duties and the control exerted by Manulife. Am the practical realities of Tongko’s work—such as the oversight and control by Manulife—supported an employment relationship.


**Now at the presented MR.**

Manulife’s motion for reconsideration argued that the Supreme Court's decision violated due process, misapplied legal standards, and disregarded critical evidence. 


The Supreme Court’s final ruling concluded that the nature of Tongko’s relationship with Manulife was **governed by the Insurance Code**, and despite some elements resembling an employment relationship, the predominant nature was an agency relationship. The dismissal of Tongko’s claim was based on the lack of sufficient evidence to support an employment relationship and the court’s view that **labor tribunals did not have jurisdiction over the matter** given the contractual nature of their relationship.


**Rationale of the Reversal - ERRONEOUS APPLICATION OPF THE 4 FOLD TEST**

The Supreme Court determined that the initial decision had erred in applying labor law standards to a situation that was governed by a combination of **insurance, civil, and contract laws,** leading to a reversal of the earlier ruling and dismissal of Tongko’s petition. This is an erroneous application of the control test.

The Court took into account the nature of the insurance industry and the legal context provided by the Insurance Code, Civil Code, and the Agreement between Tongko and Manulife. The **principal-agent relationship** typical in the insurance industry was not being appropriately considered. 

The Agreement explicitly characterized Tongko as an insurance agent, and this classification was consistent with industry practices and legal standards. There was insufficient evidence showing that Manulife exercised the kind of "means-and-manner" control over Tongko that characterizes an employer-employee relationship. Instead, the control exercised was consistent with an agency relationship, which allows principals to direct the outcomes but not necessarily the methods used by their agents.

The Court noted Tongko’s previous admissions in his tax returns and other documents where he declared himself as self-employed. These admissions contradicted his claim of being an employee and were deemed critical in assessing the true nature of his relationship with Manulife. Tongko also had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that Manulife’s control extended to the level required for an employment relationship.
