Arlene S. Espiritu was engaged by Fuji Television Network, Inc. as a news correspondent/producer. Her employment contract was initially for a term of one year but was successively renewed on a yearly basis with salary adjustment upon every renewal.

In January 2009, Arlene was diagnosed with lung cancer and informed Fuji about her condition. Fuji informed her that they would have a problem renewing her contract due to her illness. Arlene insisted that she was still fit to work as certified by her attending physician. Arlene and Fuji signed a non-renewal contract on May 5, 2009, stipulating that her contract would not be renewed after its expiration on May 31, 2009, under protest.

Arlene filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and Labor Arbiter ruled she was not a regular employee but an independent contractor. The NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter's decision, finding Arlene to be a regular employee and ordering Fuji to pay her backwages.


Both parties filed separate petitions for certiorari before the Court of Appeals which affirmed the NLRC decision, ordering Fuji to reinstate Arlene and awarding her various monetary benefits and damages. Fuji filed a petition for review on certiorari before the Supreme Court.


Decision:

The Supreme Court upheld CA decision that Arlene was a regular employee based on the four-fold test. That Arlene's work was necessary and desirable to Fuji's business and that she was illegally dismissed. Arlene's continuous contract renewals and the nature of her work qualified her as a regular employee, not an independent contractor. The employer's control over her work and the necessity of her duties in the business confirmed the employer-employee relationship.

The burden of proof often shifts depending on the claim. 

If Arlene was a regular employee and the complaints is for illegal dismissal, the burden of proof is on the employee to prove the fact of dismissal.Â Once the employee establishes the fact of dismissal, supported by substantial evidence, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show that there was a just or authorized cause for the dismissal and that due process was observed.

However, proving that she is an independent contractor rather than a regular employee falls on the employer.

**Relevant Case Law**:

- **Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora**: Recognizes the validity of fixed-term contracts, but they must be freely entered into by both parties.
- **GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga**: Highlights that not all employees require the same level of protection, depending on their qualifications and bargaining power.
- **Sonza v. ABS-CBN**: Differentiates between regular employees and independent contractors based on the "four-fold test," which includes control, wages, and power of dismissal.
- **Dumpit-Murillo v. Court of Appeals**: Reiterates that the necessity and desirability of work in the usual course of business make an employee regular, despite the fixed-term nature of the contract.

### Court Decision:

The court found that the employee, Arlene, was a regular employee despite having a fixed-term contract. Her work as a news producer was necessary and desirable to the employer's business (Fuji TV), and the continuous renewal of her contract indicated regular employment. The court applied the "four-fold test" and determined that Fuji exercised control over Arlene's work, which established an employer-employee relationship.

The court also held that Arlene was illegally dismissed. Fuji's decision not to renew her contract was influenced by her health condition, which constitutes constructive dismissal. As a regular employee, Arlene was entitled to security of tenure, and her dismissal was not justified under the Labor Code's provisions.

### The Four-Fold Test for Determining Employment Status

The **four-fold test** is a legal framework used by courts to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor. This distinction is crucial in labor disputes, as employees are entitled to certain rights and protections under labor laws, which do not apply to independent contractors. The four elements of the test are as follows:

1. **Selection and Engagement of the Employee**: Who selected and hired the individual? If the hiring party directly selects and engages the worker, it suggests an employer-employee relationship.
    
2. **Payment of Wages**: Who pays the worker? If the hiring party directly pays the individual for their work, it indicates an employer-employee relationship.
    
3. **Power of Dismissal**: Who has the authority to dismiss the worker? If the hiring party can terminate the worker's engagement, this power indicates an employer-employee relationship.
    
4. **Power of Control**: This is the most crucial element of the four-fold test. It examines who has control over the means and methods by which the work is accomplished. If the hiring party controls not only the results but also the means by which the work is done, an employer-employee relationship is likely to exist.
