## 2020 A

#### ACTIONS

Frivolous action 
- A frivolous action is a groundless lawsuit with little prospect of success; it is often brought merely to harass, annoy, and cast groundless suspicions on the integrity and reputation of the defendant. (Sian represented by Romualdo A. Sian vs. Spouses Somoso, the former being substituted by his surviving son, Anthony Voltaire B. Somoso, et al., G.R. 201812, Jan. 22, 2020)

Moot and academic cases 
- A moot and academic case is one that ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that a declaration thereon will be of no practical use or value. (Dangerous Drugs Board vs. Matibag, G.R. 210013, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

Administrative proceedings 
- The main thrust of a disciplinary proceeding against a member of the bar is to determine whether he or she is fit to continue holding the privileges of being an officer of the court; in an administrative proceeding, therefore, a complainant is a mere witness; he or she is not indispensable to the proceedings because there are no private interests involved. (Sindon vs. Presiding Judge Alzate, Regional Trial Court, Branch 1, Bangued, Abra, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2576, Jan. 29, 2020)

#### AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES

Evident premeditation 
- To substantiate the claim of evident premeditation, this Court instructed in People v. Borbon that it is indispensable that the facts on "how and when the plan to kill was hatched" are presented into evidence; in People v. Ordona, we added that "the requirement of deliberate planning should not be based merely on inferences and presumptions but on clear evidence." (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)

Treachery 
- For treachery to qualify the killing to murder, the following elements must be proven: (1) that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself [or herself], and (2) that the offender consciously adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him or her. (People vs. Pitulan, G.R. 226486, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The essence of treachery is "in the suddenness of the attack by an aggressor on the unsuspecting victim, depriving the latter of any chance to defend himself or herself and thereby ensuring the commission of the offense without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make." (Id.)

#### AGRICULTURAL TENANCY ACT OF THE PHILIPPINES (R.A. 1199), AS AMENDED

Application of 
- According to R.A. 1199, as amended, otherwise known as the Agricultural Tenancy Act of the Philippines, an agricultural leasehold tenancy exists "when a person who, either personally or with the aid of labor available from members of his immediate farm household, undertakes to cultivate a piece of agricultural land susceptible of cultivation by a single person together with members of his immediate farm household, belonging to or legally possessed by, another in consideration of a fixed amount in money or in produce or in both." (Romero, et al. vs. Sombrino, G.R. 241353, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The absence of any of the requisites does not make an occupant, cultivator, or a planter a de jure tenant which entitles him to security of tenure under existing tenancy laws; however, if all the aforesaid requisites are present and an agricultural leasehold relation is established, the same shall confer upon the agricultural lessee the right to continue working on the landholding until such leasehold relation is extinguished; the agricultural lessee shall be entitled to security of tenure on his landholding and cannot be ejected therefrom unless authorized by the Court for causes herein provided; in case of death or permanent incapacity of the agricultural lessor, the leasehold shall bind the legal heirs. (Id.)


- The existence of a tenancy relation is not presumed; according to established jurisprudence, the following indispensable elements must be proven in order for a tenancy agreement to arise: 1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; 2) the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; 3) there is consent between the parties to the relationship; 4) the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; 5) there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and 6) the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee. (Id.)

Tenancy relationship 
- Tenancy relationship can only be created with the consent of the true and lawful landowner who is the owner, lessee, usufructuary or legal possessor of the land; it cannot be created by the act of a supposed landowner, who has no right to the land subject of the tenancy, much less by one who has been dispossessed of the same by final judgment. (Romero, et al. vs. Sombrino, G.R. 241353, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Tenancy relationship cannot be presumed; an assertion that one is a tenant does not automatically give rise to security of tenure; nor does the sheer fact of working on another's landholding raise a presumption of the existence of agricultural tenancy; one who claims to be a tenant has the onus to prove the affirmative allegation of tenancy; hence, substantial evidence is needed to establish that the landowner and tenant came to an agreement in entering into a tenancy relationship. (Id.)

#### ALIBI

Defense of 
- It is a well-settled rule that alibi and denial are inherently weak defenses and they deserve scant regard when the prosecution has clearly established the identity of the accused. (Delos Santos vs. People, G.R. 227581, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### ANTI-HAZING LAW (R.A. 8049)

Application of 
- Hazing often involves a conspiracy among those involved, be it in the planning stage, the inducement of the victim, or in the participation in the actual initiation rites; the rule on res inter alios acta, then, does not apply. (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)


- R.A. 8049, nevertheless, presents a novel provision that introduces a disputable presumption of actual participation; and which modifies the concept of conspiracy; Section 4, paragraph 6 thereof provides that the presence of any person during the hazing is prima facie evidence of participation as principal, unless he prevented the commission of the punishable acts; this provision is unique because a disputable presumption arises from the mere presence of the offender during the hazing, which can be rebutted by proving that the accused took steps to prevent the commission of the hazing. (Id.)


- The Anti-Hazing Law aims to prevent organizations from making hazing a requirement for admission; the increased penalties imposed on those who participate in hazing is the country's response to a reprehensible phenomenon that persists in schools and institutions; the Anti-Hazing Law seeks to punish the conspiracy of silence and secrecy, tantamount to impunity, that would otherwise shroud the crimes committed. (Id.)


- The intent of the Anti-Hazing Law is to deter members of a fraternity, sorority, organization, or association from making hazing a requirement for admission; by making the conduct of initiation rites that cause physical and psychological harm malum prohibitum, the law rejects the defense that one's desire to belong to a group gives that group the license to injure, or even cause the person's death. (Id.)


- Those group members who do not actually perform the hazing ritual, but who by their presence incite or exacerbate the violence being committed, may be principals either by inducement or by indispensable cooperation. (Id.)

Constitutionality of 
- The Anti-Hazing Law is not a bill of attainder; bills of attainder are prohibited under Article III, Section 22 of the Constitution, which states: SECTION 22. No ex post facto law or bill of attainder shall be enacted; a bill of attainder encroaches on the courts' power to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused and to impose the corresponding penalty, violating the doctrine of separation of powers; for a law to be considered a bill of attainder, it must be shown to contain all of the following: "a specification of certain individuals or a group of individuals, the imposition of a punishment, penal or otherwise, and the lack of judicial trial." (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)

#### ANTI-HAZING LAW (R.A. 8049), AS AMENDED BY R.A. 11053

Application of 
- Section 14, paragraph 4 of the Anti-Hazing Law turns cowardice into virtue, shame into strength, and disobedience into heroism; more than that, this serves as a grave warning that failing to act knowing fully well that others are being traumatized, injured, maimed, or killed does not make a person only an observer or witness. (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)


- Section 14(c) imposes the lower penalty for one's presence during the hazing 
- reclusion temporal in its maximum period with a P1-million fine; as the penalty is not reclusion perpetua, the accused may also benefit from the application of Republic Act No. 4103, as amended, otherwise known as the Indeterminate Sentence Law. (Id.)

#### APPEALS

Appeal in criminal cases 
- In criminal cases, an appeal "throws the whole case open for review; the underlying principle is that errors in an appealed judgment, even if not specifically assigned, may be corrected motu proprio by the court if the consideration of these errors is necessary to arrive at a just resolution of the case." (People vs. Salen, Jr., G.R. 231013, Jan. 29, 2020)


- It has been held that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite, and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment whether they are assigned or unassigned; the appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law. (People vs. Fornillos @ "Intoy", G.R. 231991, Jan. 27, 2020)

Factual findings of administrative and quasi-judicial agencies 
- Factual findings of administrative and quasi-judicial agencies, such as the Ombudsman, are generally accorded not only respect but at times finality, this holds true only when they are supported by substantial evidence. (Ancheta vs. Villa, G.R. 229634, Jan. 15, 2020)


- It deserves mentioning that factual findings of quasi-judicial bodies like the NLRC, if supported by substantial evidence, are accorded respect and even finality by this Court, more so when they coincide with those of the LA, as in this case. (Herma Shipping and Transport Corporation vs. Cordero, G.R. 244144, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Settled is the rule that factual findings by quasi-judicial bodies and administrative agencies, when supported by substantial evidence and sustained by the Court of Appeals, are accorded great respect and binding upon this Court; we recognize that administrative agencies possess specialized knowledge and expertise in their respective fields, so long as the quantum of evidence required in administrative proceedings which is substantial evidence has been met. (Soliva vs. Dr. Tanggol, in his capacity as Chancellor of Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT), G.R. 223429, Jan. 29, 2020)

Factual findings of the National Labor Relations Commission 
- Judicial review of labor cases must not go beyond the evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence upon and as such, the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the NLRC are generally accorded not only great weight and respect but even clothed with finality and deemed binding on the Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. (Prime Stars International Promotion Corporation, et al. vs. Baybayan, et al., G.R. 213961, Jan. 22, 2020)

Petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 
- A catena of cases has consistently held that questions of fact cannot be raised in an appeal via certiorari before the Court and are not proper for its consideration; the Court is not a trier of facts; it is not the Court's function to examine and weigh all over again the evidence presented in the proceedings below. (Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Macabagdal, represented by Eulogia Macabagdal-Pascual, G.R. 203948, Jan. 22, 2020)


- A petition for review under Rule 45 is limited only to questions of law; factual questions are not the proper subject of an appeal by certiorari. (Soliva vs. Dr. Tanggol, in his capacity as Chancellor of Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT), G.R. 223429, Jan. 29, 2020)


- As a general rule, only questions of law raised via a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court are reviewable by the Court; factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, including labor tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are specialized to rule on matters falling within substantial evidence. (Multinational Ship Management, Inc./Singa Ship Agencies, Pte. Ltd., et al. vs. Briones, G.R. 239793, Jan. 27, 2020)


- As a general rule, questions of fact are not proper subjects of appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court as this mode of appeal is confined to questions of law; nevertheless, the foregoing general rule admits of several exceptions such as when the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; when the inference made is manifestly mistaken; and when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts. (Romero, et al. vs. Sombrino, G.R. 241353, Jan. 22, 2020)


- As a rule, this Court is not a trier of facts; only questions of law distinctly set forth in the petition ought to be raised before this Court; factual findings of the trial and appellate courts will not be disturbed by this Court unless they are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises, or conjectures, among others. (National Power Corporation vs. Heirs of Salvador Serra Serra, et al., G.R. 224324, Jan. 22, 2020)


- As the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC, and the CA uniformly ruled against the validity, regularity, and due execution of the employee's resignation letter and affidavit of quitclaim, the court finds no reason to deviate from that findings; it is binding on the court in the absence of arbitrariness or grave abuse of discretion. (Al-Masiya Overseas Placement Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Viernes, G.R. 216132, Jan. 22, 2020)


- It bears stressing that in a petition for review on certiorari, the Court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing errors of law in the absence of any showing that the factual findings complained of are devoid of support in the records or are glaringly erroneous; the Court is not a trier of facts, and this rule applies with greater force in labor cases; questions of fact are to be resolved by the labor tribunals. (Id.)


- It is settled that the jurisdiction of the Court under Rule 45 is limited only to questions of law as the Court is not a trier of facts; this rule, however, allows for exceptions such as when the findings of fact of the trial court, or in this case of the quasi-judicial agencies concerned, are conflicting or contradictory with those of the CA. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)


- Parties cannot simply assert that the exception to the rule that factual issues are beyond the scope of a petition for review, should apply to their case without substantiating and proving their claim; mere allegation of any of the exceptions does not suffice, but the same must be alleged, substantiated, and proved by the parties so the court may evaluate and review the facts of the case. (Spouses Franco, et al. vs. Spouses Galera, Jr., G.R. 205266, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, states that only questions of law shall be raised in a petition for review on certiorari. (Delos Santos vs. People, G.R. 227581, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The arguments raised by petitioner inarguably require to inquire into the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution, a course of action which this Court will, generally, not do, consistent with our repeated holding that this Court is not a trier of facts; it is basic that factual findings of trial courts, including their assessment of witnesses' credibility, are entitled to great weight and respect by this Court, especially when affirmed by the CA. (Soriano vs. People, G.R. 240458, Jan. 8, 2020)


- The rule that only questions of law are the proper subject of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court applies with equal force to expropriation cases; unless the value of the expropriated property is grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures, such issue is beyond the scope of the Court's judicial review in a Rule 45 petition. (National Transmission Corporation, as Transferee-in-Interest of the National Power Corporation vs. Spouses Taglao, G.R. 223195, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The Rules of Court requires that only questions of law should be raised in petitions filed under Rule 45; this Court is not a trier of facts; it will not entertain questions of fact as the factual findings of the appellate courts are final, binding, or conclusive on the parties and upon this court when supported by substantial evidence. (Ignacio, doing business under the name and style Teresa R. Ignacio Enterprises vs. Ragasa, et al., G.R. 227896, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The settled rule is that the Court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari is limited to resolving only questions of law; a question of law arises when doubt exists as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts. (Herma Shipping and Transport Corporation vs. Cordero, G.R. 244144, Jan. 27, 2020)


- This Court, not being a trier of facts, must necessarily remand the case to the trial court for the accounting, reception of evidence and evaluation thereof for the proper determination of the ownership and share of the parties. (Paterno vs. Paterno, G.R. 213687, Jan. 08, 2020)


- Whether a person is an agricultural tenant is a question of fact, not law, which is outside the scope of a petition for review on certiorari; the lower courts' factual findings are considered final, binding, or conclusive on the parties and on the court when these are supported by substantial evidence. (Spouses Franco, et al. vs. Spouses Galera, Jr., G.R. 205266, Jan. 15, 2020)

Question of fact 
- A question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding circumstances as well as their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probability of the situation. (The Heirs of Marsella T. Lupena [in substitution of Marsella T. Lupena] vs. Medina, G.R. 231639, Jan. 22, 2020)


- A question of fact requires this Court to review the truthfulness or falsity of the allegations of the parties; this review includes assessment of the "probative value of the evidence presented." (Ignacio, doing business under the name and style Teresa R. Ignacio Enterprises vs. Ragasa, et al., G.R. 227896, Jan. 29, 2020)

Question of law and question of fact 
- If the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact; the test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact. (Ang, et al. vs. Abaldonado, G.R. 231913, Jan. 15, 2020)


- In Century Iron Works, Inc. v. Bañas, the Court differentiated between question of law and question of fact, thus: a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts; for a question to be one of law, the question must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants or any of them. (Delos Santos vs. People, G.R. 227581, Jan. 15, 2020)


- In Far Eastern Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. v. People, the Court differentiated questions of law from questions of fact, to wit: a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts; for a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants, but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts. (Ang, et al. vs. Abaldonado, G.R. 231913, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise it is a question of fact. (Delos Santos vs. People, G.R. 227581, Jan. 15, 2020)

Rules on 
- In Guagua National Colleges v. Court of Appeals, et al., to wit: the 10-day period stated in Article 276 should be understood as the period within which the party adversely affected by the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrators or Panel of Arbitrators may file a motion for reconsideration; only after the resolution of the motion for reconsideration may the aggrieved party appeal to the CA by filing the petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court within 15 days from notice pursuant to Section 4 of Rule 43; the foregoing ruling applies to a petition for review under Rule 43 that is not preceded by a motion for reconsideration with the Voluntary Arbitrator, for, at that time, such motion was a prohibited pleading under the procedural rules of the Department of Labor and Employment and the National Conciliation and Mediation Board. (Del Monte Fresh Produce (Philippines), Inc. vs. Del Monte Fresh Supervisors Union, G.R. 225115, Jan. 27, 2020)

#### ARREST

Search incident to a lawful arrest 
- The search conducted inside the utility box of the motorcycle was legal; a search incident to a lawful arrest under Section 13, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court states: SEC. 13. Search incident to lawful arrest; a person lawfully arrested may be searched for dangerous weapons or anything which may have been used or constitute proof in the commission of an offense without a search warrant; in the instant case, the shabu was found in a peppermint gum container inside the utility box of accused-appellants' motorcycle that was within their immediate control; therefore, it is within the permissible area that the apprehending officers could validly execute a warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest. (People vs. Amago, G.R. 227739, Jan. 15, 2020)

Warrantless arrest 
- Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides the occasions on which a person may be arrested without a warrant, to wit: Section 5. Arrest without warrant; when lawful. 
- A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant, arrest a person: (a) When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit an offense; (b) When an offense has just been committed and he has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it; and (c) When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is serving final judgment or is temporarily confined while his case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred from one confinement to another. (People vs. Amago, G.R. 227739, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### ATTORNEYS

Attorney-client privilege communication 
- A compromise agreement prepared by a lawyer pursuant to the instruction of his client and delivered to the opposing party, an offer and counter-offer for settlement, as in this case, or a document given by a client to his counsel not in his professional capacity, are not privileged communications, the element of confidentiality not being present. (Minas vs. Doctor, Jr., A.C. No. 12660, Jan. 28, 2020)


- The mere relation of attorney and client does not raise a presumption of confidentiality; the client must intend for the communication to be confidential; a confidential communication refers to information transmitted by voluntary act of disclosure between attorney and client in confidence and by means, which, so far as the client is aware, discloses the information to no third person other than one reasonably necessary for the transmission of the information or the accomplishment of the purpose for which it was given. (Id.)

Conflict of interest 
- A conflict of interest exists when a lawyer represents inconsistent interests of two opposing parties, like when the lawyer performs an act that will injuriously affect his first client in any matter in which he represented him, or when the lawyer uses any knowledge he previously acquired from his first client against the latter. (Hierro vs. Nava II, A.C. No. 9459, Jan. 7, 2020)


- The prohibition against conflict of interest is founded on principles of public policy and good taste, inasmuch as the lawyer-client relationship is based on trust and confidence; its purpose is to ensure absolute freedom of communication between the lawyer and the client in order to enable the former to suitably represent and serve the latter's interests. (Id.)

Disbarment 
- A disbarment case is sui generis for it is neither purely civil nor purely criminal, but is rather an investigation by the court into the conduct of its officers; the issue to be determined is whether respondent is still fit to continue to be an officer of the court in the dispensation of justice; an administrative proceeding for disbarment continues despite the desistance of a complainant, or failure of the complainant to prosecute the same. (Aguirre vs. Atty. Reyes, A.C. No. 4355, Jan. 8, 2020)


- In administrative proceedings, such as disbarment, the quantum of proof necessary for a finding of guilt is substantial evidence, i.e., that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; complainants have the burden of proving by substantial evidence the allegations in their complaints; the basic rule is that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof. (Aguirre vs. Atty. Reyes, A.C. No. 4355, Jan. 8, 2020)

Disciplinary proceedings 
- Disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are sui generis; they are neither purely civil nor purely criminal which involve a trial of an action or a suit; they are rather investigations by the Court into the conduct of its officers; public interest is their primary objective and the real question for determination is whether or not the attorney should still be allowed the privileges as such. (Ladrera vs. Atty. Osorio, A.C. No. 10315, Jan. 22, 2020)

Duties 
- A lawyer's responsibility to protect and advance the interests of his client does not warrant a course of action propelled by ill motives and malicious intentions against the other party; mandated to maintain the dignity of the legal profession, they must conduct themselves honorably and fairly; they advance the honor of their profession and the best interests of their clients when they render service or give advice that meets the strictest principles of moral law. (Martin-Ortega vs. Tadena, A.C. No. 12018, Jan. 29, 2020)


- As an officer of the court, it is a lawyer's duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the Court; the highest form of respect for judicial authority is shown by a lawyer's obedience to court orders and processes. (Miranda vs. Atty. Carpio, A.C. No. 6281, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The relationship between a lawyer and his client is highly fiduciary and prescribes on a lawyer a great fidelity and good faith; the highly fiduciary nature of this relationship imposes upon the lawyer the duty to account for the money or property collected or received for or from his client. (Caballero vs. Pilapil, A.C. No. 7075, Jan. 21, 2020)


- While a lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client, it should not be at the expense of truth and the administration of justice; under the Code of Professional Responsibility, a lawyer has the duty to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice, and is enjoined from unduly delaying a case by impeding execution of a judgment or by misusing court processes. (Martin-Ortega vs. Tadena, A.C. No. 12018, Jan. 29, 2020)


- While lawyers owe their entire devotion to the interest of their clients and zeal in the defense of their client's right, they should not forget that they are, first and foremost, officers of the court, bound to exert every effort to assist in the speedy and efficient administration of justice. (Id.)

Gross immorality 
- As a basis of disciplinary action, such immoral conduct, or immorality must be so corrupt as to virtually constitute a criminal act or so unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree or committed under such scandalous or revolting circumstances as to shock the common sense of decency. (Hierro vs. Nava II, A.C. No. 9459, Jan. 7, 2020)

Language used by a lawyer 
- Though a lawyer's language may be forceful and emphatic, it should always be dignified and respectful, befitting the dignity of the legal profession; the use of intemperate language and unkind ascriptions has no place in the dignity of the judicial forum. (Aguirre vs. Atty. Reyes, A.C. No. 4355, Jan. 8, 2020)

Liability of 
- A member of the Bar may be penalized, even disbarred or suspended from his office as an attorney, for violation of the lawyer's oath and/or for breach of the ethics of the legal profession as embodied in the CPR; for the practice of law is "a profession, a form of public trust, the performance of which is entrusted to those who are qualified and who possess good moral character." (Caballero vs. Pilapil, A.C. No. 7075, Jan. 21, 2020)


- Respondent's cavalier attitude in repeatedly ignoring the orders of the Supreme Court constitutes utter disrespect to the judicial institution; respondent's conduct indicates a high degree of irresponsibility; a Court's Resolution is "not to be construed as a mere request, nor should it be complied with partially, inadequately, or selectively"; respondent's obstinate refusal to comply with the Court's orders "not only betrays a recalcitrant flaw in her character; it also underscores her disrespect of the Court's lawful orders which is only too deserving of reproof." (Id.)


- The Court has previously held that disciplinary proceedings should only revolve around the determination of the respondent-lawyer's administrative liability and not his civil liability; it must be clarified that this rule remains applicable only to claimed liabilities which are purely civil in nature for instance, when the claim involves moneys received by the lawyer from his client in a transaction separate and distinct and not intrinsically linked to his professional engagement. (Minas vs. Doctor, Jr., A.C. No. 12660, Jan. 28, 2020)


- The relationship between a lawyer and his client is highly fiduciary and prescribes on a lawyer great fidelity and good faith; the highly fiduciary nature of this relationship imposes upon the lawyer the duty to account for the money or property collected or received for or from his client; a lawyer's failure to return, upon demand, the funds held by him on behalf of his client, as in this case, gives rise to the presumption that he has appropriated the same for his own use, in violation of the trust reposed in him by his client. (Id.)

Negligence of counsel 
- It is worth emphasizing that the rule which states that the mistakes of counsel bind the client may not be strictly followed where observance of it would result in outright deprivation of the client's liberty or property, or where the interests of justice so require; in rendering justice, procedural infirmities take a backseat against substantive rights of litigants; if the strict application of the rules would tend to frustrate rather than promote justice, the Court is not without power to exercise its judicial discretion in relaxing the rules of procedure. (Latogan vs. People, G.R. 238298, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The negligence of the counsel binds the client, even mistakes in the application of procedural rules; the only exception to this doctrine is "when the reckless or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client of due process of law"; in such a case, the counsel's error must be so palpable and maliciously exercised that it would viably be the basis for disciplinary action. (Spouses Abrogar vs. Land Bank, G.R. 221046, Jan. 22, 2020)

Presumption of misappropriation 
- A lawyer's failure to return upon demand the funds held by him on behalf of his client gives rise to the presumption that he has appropriated the same for his own use in violation of the trust reposed to him by his client; such act is a gross violation of general morality as well as of professional ethics. (Caballero vs. Pilapil, A.C. No. 7075, Jan. 21, 2020)

Solicitation of legal business 
- The standards of the legal profession condemn the lawyer's advertisement of his talents; a lawyer cannot, without violating the ethics of his profession, advertise his talents or skills in a manner similar to a merchant advertising his goods; the proscription against advertising of legal services or solicitation of legal business rests on the fundamental postulate that the practice of law is a profession. (Aguirre vs. Atty. Reyes, A.C. No. 4355, Jan. 8, 2020)

Sui generis 
- It must be noted that administrative cases are sui generis and are not affected by the result of any civil or criminal case; they do not involve a trial of an action or a suit, being neither purely civil nor purely criminal, but rather involve investigations by the Court into the conduct of its officers. (Hierro vs. Nava II, A.C. No. 9459, Jan. 7, 2020)

Suspension from practice of law 
- Jurisprudence is replete with cases where the Court held that "the lifting of a lawyer's suspension is not automatic upon the end of the period stated in the Court's decision, and an order from the Court lifting the suspension at the end of the period is necessary in order to enable him to resume the practice of his profession." (Miranda vs. Atty. Carpio, A.C. No. 6281, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### BANKS

Banking institutions 
- The banking industry is one impressed with great public interest as it affects economies and plays a significant role in businesses and commerce; the public reposes its faith and confidence upon banks, such that even the humble wage-earner has not hesitated to entrust his life's savings to the bank of his choice, knowing that they will be safe in its custody and will even earn some interest for him; this is the reason why the fiduciary nature of the banks' functions is well-entrenched in jurisprudence. (Catapang vs. Lipa Bank, G.R. 240645, Jan. 27, 2020)


- The public relies on the banks' sworn profession of diligence and meticulousness in giving irreproachable service; the level of meticulousness must be maintained at all times by the banking sector. (Id.)

#### BASES CONVERSION AND DEVELOPMENT (BCDA) ACT OF 1992 (R.A. 7227), AS AMENDED BY R.A. 7917

Application of 
- Section 8 [of R.A. 7227, as amended] is two (2) pronged; the first commands that the sale proceeds of certain properties in Fort Bonifacio and Villamor (Nicholas) Air Base are deemed appropriated by Congress to each of the aforenamed recipients and for the respective purposes specified therein; the sale proceeds are not BCDA income but public funds subject to the distribution scheme and purposes provided in the law itself; the second expressly enjoins that the proceeds of the sale shall not be diminished by any item or circumstance, including all forms of taxes and fees. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Bases Conversion and Development Authority, G.R. 217898, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### BILL OF RIGHTS

Equal protection clause 
- Equal protection "does not demand absolute equality among residents; it merely requires that all persons shall be treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions both as to privileges conferred and liabilities enforced." (Zomer Development Company, Inc. vs. Special Twentieth Division of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, et al., G.R. 194461, Jan. 7, 2020)


- In Samahan ng Progresibong Kabataan v. Quezon City, this Court summarized the three (3) tests to determine the reasonableness of a classification: the strict scrutiny test applies when classification either (i) interferes with the exercise of fundamental rights, including the basic liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, or (ii) burdens suspect classes; the intermediate scrutiny test applies when a classification does not involve suspect classes or fundamental rights, but requires heightened scrutiny, such as in classifications based on gender and legitimacy; lastly, the rational basis test applies to all other subjects not covered by the first two tests. (Id.)


- The Constitution guarantees that no person shall be denied equal protection of the laws; the right to equal protection of the laws guards "against undue favor and individual or class privilege, as well as hostile discrimination or the oppression of inequality"; equal protection, however, was not intended to prohibit the legislature from enacting statutes that either tend to create specific classes of persons or objects, or tend to affect only these specific classes of persons or objects. (Id.)

Right to be presumed innocent 
- Every accused has the right to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proven beyond reasonable doubt; the presumption of innocence stands as a fundamental principle of both constitutional and criminal law; the prosecution has the burden of proving every single fact establishing guilt; every vestige of doubt having a rational basis must be removed; the defense of the accused, even if weak, is no reason to convict. (People vs. Carreon, G.R. 229086, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Every criminal proceeding begins with the constitutionally safeguarded presumption that the accused is innocent, which can only be overturned by proof beyond reasonable doubt; the prosecution has the burden of proof; it must not depend on the weakness of the defense; rather, it must depend on the strength of its own cause. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)

Rights of the accused 
- Article III, Section 12(1) and 17 of the Constitution's Bill of Rights: SECTION 12. (1) Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice; if the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with one; these rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)

#### CERTIFICATION AGAINST FORUM SHOPPING

Late submission of secretary's certificate 
- Case law provides that a party's belated submission of a Secretary's Certificate constitutes substantial compliance with the rules, as it operates to ratify and affirm the authority of the delegate to represent such party before the courts. (Good Earth Enterprises, Inc. vs. Garcia, et al., G.R. 238761, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### CERTIORARI

Petition for 
- A petition for certiorari is proper where the impugned dispositions, as in this case, are tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- A petition for certiorari under Rule 65 "is a special civil action that may be resorted to only in the absence of appeal or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law." (Republic vs. Quiñonez, G.R. 237412, Jan. 6, 2020)


- As a general rule, a motion for reconsideration must first be filed with the lower court before the extraordinary remedy of certiorari is resorted to, since a motion for reconsideration is considered a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; this general rule admits of well-established exceptions, one of which is when the Issue raised is a pure question of law; there is a question of law in a given case when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, and there is a question of fact when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged facts. (Id.)


- As the remedies of appeal and certiorari are mutually exclusive, certiorari will not prosper if appeal is an available remedy to a litigant, even if the ground is grave abuse of discretion. (Spouses Abrogar vs. Land Bank, G.R. 221046, Jan. 22, 2020)


- It is settled that a special civil action for certiorari may only be resorted to in cases where there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. (Id.)


- Mallari v. Banco Filipino Savings & Mortgage Bank enumerates these instances, viz.: indeed, the Court in some instances has allowed a petition for certiorari to prosper notwithstanding the availability of an appeal, such as, (a) when public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictate it; (b) when the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null; and (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Mere disagreement with the Ombudsman's findings is not enough to constitute grave abuse of discretion; the Office of the Ombudsman has both the constitutional and statutory mandate to act on criminal complaints against erring public officials and employees; as an independent constitutional body, the Office of the Ombudsman is given a wide latitude to conduct investigations and to prosecute cases to fulfill its role "as the champion of the people" and "preserver of the integrity of the public service." (Beltran, et al. vs. Sandiganbayan (Second Division), et al., G.R. 201117, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Proper remedy to assail the final, executory and unappealable decision of the Ombudsman. (Ancheta vs. Villa, G.R. 229634, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Since the remedy of an ordinary appeal was undeniably available to petitioners, the CA correctly dismissed their Petition for Certiorari for being the wrong mode of appeal; in an attempt to justify their plea for the liberal application of the Rules, petitioners insist that they should not be bound by their former counsel's negligence in choosing to file the wrong remedy because it would deprive them of their property without due process of law; this argument, however, is untenable. (Spouses Abrogar vs. Land Bank, G.R. 221046, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The extraordinary remedy of certiorari is not a substitute for a lost appeal; it is not allowed when a party to a case fails to appeal a judgment to the proper forum, especially if one's own negligence or error in one's choice of remedy occasioned such loss or lapse. (Id.)

Writ of 
- To assail the Ombudsman's determination of probable cause, an allegation of grave abuse of discretion must be substantiated; grave abuse of discretion exists where a power is exercised in an arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility so patent and gross as to amount to evasion of positive duty or virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by, or in contemplation of law. (Arroyo vs. Sandiganbayan Fifth Division, et al., G.R. 210488, Jan. 27, 2020)


- To justify the issuance of the writ of certiorari on the ground of abuse of discretion, the abuse must be grave and it must be so patent as to be equivalent to having acted without jurisdiction. (Id.)

#### CIVIL REGISTRAR GENERAL

Functions 
- Administrative Order No. 1 of the Office of the Civil Registrar General, an application for the delayed registration of a marriage certificate is required to be posted on the city bulletin board for 10 days to afford the public an opportunity to oppose it; only after the 10-day posting period can the civil registrar evaluate the application, along with its supporting documents, and ascertain if there are any anomalies in the solemnization of the marriage or invalidities between the parties. (Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao vs. Llauder, G.R. 219062, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Administrative Order No. 1 of the Office of the Civil Registrar General states that the civil registrar is the person or body charged by law for the recording of vital events and other documents affecting a person's civil status; the Administrative Order takes pains in laying out the proper procedures for the registration of one's life events, including his or her birth, marriage, and death. (Id.)

#### CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION (CSC)

Career Executive Service Board (CESB) 
- The CESB, as the Court ruled in Career Executive Service Board v. Civil Service Commission, which was cited in Feliciano, has the authority to "(a) identify other officers belonging to the CES in keeping with the conditions imposed by law; and (b) prescribe requirements for entrance to the third-level." (Dangerous Drugs Board vs. Matibag, G.R. 210013, Jan. 22, 2020)

CSC Revised Rules on Contempt 
- The CSC wields the power to punish for contempt; the Court has never nullified the rules of procedure of Constitutional Commissions on ground that their respective enabling laws supposedly do not authorize them to prescribe penalties for contemptuous conduct. (Eusebio vs. Civil Service Commission, G.R. 223623, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Under Section 4 of the CSC Revised Rules on Contempt, a fine of P1,000.00 may be imposed on the contemnor for each day of defiance of, disobedience to, or non-enforcement of, a final ruling of the CSC; if the contempt consists in the violation of an injunction or omission to do an act which is within the power of respondent to perform, he or she, in addition, shall be liable for damages as a consequence thereof. (Id.)


- Under Section 6, Article IX-A of the 1987 Constitution, the CSC en banc may promulgate its own rules concerning pleadings and practice before any of its offices so long as such rules do not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. (Id.)

#### CODE OF CONDUCT FOR COURT PERSONNEL (A.M. NO. 03-06-13-SC)

Application of 
- CANON I Fidelity to Duty SEC. 1. Court personnel shall not use their official position to secure unwarranted benefits, privileges or exemptions for themselves or for others. CANON IV Performance of Duties SEC. 1. Court personnel shall at all times perform official duties properly and with diligence. They shall commit themselves exclusively to the business and responsibilities of their office during working hours. (Mondejar vs. Laspiñas, Legal Researcher, et al., A.M. No. P-19-3996, Jan. 7, 2020)


- CANON I Fidelity to Duty SEC. 4. Court personnel shall not accept any fee or remuneration beyond what they receive or are entitled to in their official capacity; CANON III Conflict of Interest SEC. 2. Court personnel shall not: (b) Receive tips or other remuneration for assisting or attending to parties engaged in transactions or involved in actions or proceedings with the Judiciary. (Id.)


- CANON I Fidelity to Duty SEC. 5. Court personnel shall use the resources, property and funds under their official custody in a judicious manner and solely in accordance with the prescribed statutory and regulatory guidelines or procedures. (Id.)


- In Office of the Court Administrator v. Dalawis, the Court enunciated that court personnel must follow a high standard of honesty and integrity in the administration of justice; respondents were fixers, and they carry out this arrangement for a fee; as correctly held by Judge Chua, respondents violated several provisions of A.M. No. 03-06-13-SC or the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, promulgated on April 13, 2004; respondents' infractions are classified as grave offenses and punishable by dismissal from the service under Section 50(A)(3)(10) of the Civil Service Commission Resolution No. 1701077, or the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS), promulgated on July 3, 2017. (Id.)

#### COMPLEX CRIMES

Penalty 
- Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code requires that the penalty for a complex crime is the maximum penalty of the graver offense; the penalty for homicide is reclusion temporal while the penalty for direct assault is prision correccional; the proper penalty to be imposed for the complex crime of direct assault with homicide is reclusion temporal, subject to the Indeterminate Sentence Law. (People vs. Pitulan, G.R. 226486, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### COMPREHENSIVE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW (R.A. 3844)

Agricultural leasehold relations 
- In agricultural leasehold relations, the agricultural lessor who can be the owner, civil law lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor of the land grants his or her land's cultivation and use to the agricultural lessee, who in turn pays a price certain in money, or in produce, or both; the definition and elements of leasehold tenancy relations are similar to those of share tenancy; a slight difference, however, exists: a leasehold relation is not extinguished by the mere expiration of the contract's term or period, nor by the sale or transfer of legal possession of the land to another. (Spouses Franco, et al. vs. Spouses Galera, Jr., G.R. 205266, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The law also grants the agricultural lessee the right to preempt an intended sale; but if the property has been sold without the agricultural lessee's knowledge, he or she shall have the right to redeem the property, as in line with the law's objective of allowing tenant-farmers to own the land they cultivate. (Id.)


- The right of redemption granted to the agricultural lessee enjoys preference over any other legal redemption that may be exercised over the property; upon filing of the petition or request, the 180-day period shall cease to run, and will commence again upon the resolution of the petition or request or within 60 days from its filing. (Id.)

Agricultural tenancy agreement 
- Agricultural tenancy arrangements under Republic Act No. 3844 may be established either orally or in writing; the form of the contract is only prescribed when parties decide to reduce their agreement in writing, but it no longer affects the tenancy arrangement's validity. (Spouses Franco, et al. vs. Spouses Galera, Jr., G.R. 205266, Jan. 15, 2020)


- An express agreement of agricultural tenancy is not necessary; the tenancy relationship can be implied from the conduct of the parties. (Id.)


- For a valid agricultural tenancy arrangement to exist, these elements must concur: (1) the parties are the landowner and the tenant; (2) the subject matter is agricultural land; (3) there is consent between the parties; (4) the purpose is agricultural production; (5) there is personal cultivation by the tenant; and (6) there is sharing of the harvests between the parties; all these elements must be proven by substantial evidence; "the absence of one or more requisites is fatal"; as with any affirmative allegation, the burden of proof rests on the party who alleges it. (Id.)


- Section 5 of Republic Act No. 3844 also allows agricultural leasehold relations to be established impliedly: Section 5. Establishment of Agricultural Leasehold Relation; the agricultural leasehold relation shall be established by operation of law in accordance with Section four of this Code and, in other cases, either orally or in writing, expressly or impliedly. (Id.)

#### COMPREHENSIVE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW OF 1988 (R.A. 6657)

Death of a tenant-beneficiary 
- Memorandum Circular No. 19, series of 1978 (MC 19), which governs the transfer of farm holdings upon the death of the farmer-beneficiary, provides that upon the death of the original farmer-beneficiary, the ownership and cultivation of the farm holding shall ultimately be consolidated in one heir; such succeeding sole owner-cultivator is required to compensate the other compulsory heirs of the original farmer-beneficiary, to the extent of their respective legal interests in the farmland as of the death of the original farmer-beneficiary. (Golez, in his own behalf and his children Crispino Golez, et al. vs. Abais, G.R. 191376, Jan. 08, 2020)


- Upon the death of the new sole owner-cultivator, his or her successor-in-interest is bound to compensate the other compulsory heirs of the deceased farmer-beneficiary, to the extent of their respective legal interests in the disputed lots, subject to the payment of whatever outstanding obligations the deceased farmer-beneficiary might still have; the identification of the other heirs of the deceased original farmer-beneficiary, the determination of their respective interests in the disputed lots, as well as the obligations of the successor-in-interest of the deceased sole owner-cultivator, are factual matters which cannot be resolved in a petition for review, as all matters relating to the implementation of agrarian laws fall within the primary jurisdiction of the DAR regional director. (Id.)

Land Bank of the Philippines 
- In the case of Land Bank of the Philippines v. Baldoza, We reiterated that since LBP is performing a governmental function in an agrarian reform proceeding, it is exempt from payment of costs of suit, including commissioners' fees, as it is considered part of costs of suit. (Land Bank vs. Heirs of Bartolome J. Sanchez, G.R. 214902, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In the case of Land Bank of the Philippines v. Gonzales and Land Bank of the Philippines v. Ibarra, We ruled that LBP is exempt from paying the costs of the suit pursuant to Section 1, Rule 142 of the Rules, since it is an instrumentality performing a governmental function in agrarian reform proceedings charged with the disbursement of public funds. (Id.)


- The role of LBP in agrarian reform is more than just the ministerial duty of keeping and disbursing the Agrarian Reform Funds; LBP is also primarily responsible for the valuation and determination of just compensation. (Id.)

#### COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002 (R.A. 9165)

Chain of custody 
- A local government employee witnessed the inventory and taking of photographs of the seized items but none of the three (3) people required by Section 21(1), as originally worded, was present; the prosecution has "the positive duty to establish that earnest efforts were employed in contacting the representatives enumerated under Section 21(1) of Republic Act No. 9165, or that there was a justifiable ground for failing to do so." (People vs. Sebilleno, G.R. 221457, Jan. 13, 2020)


- Based on Section 21(1), the procedure to safeguard the integrity of the confiscated items used as evidence can be summarized as follows: (1) the seized items must be inventoried and photographed immediately after seizure or confiscation; (2) the physical inventory and photographing must be done in the presence of (a) the accused of his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the DOJ, all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Compliance with the chain of custody requirements ensures the integrity of the seized illicit drug in four (4) respects: first, the nature of the substances or items seized; second, the quantity (e.g., weight) of the substances or items seized; third, the relation of the substances or items seized to the incident allegedly causing their seizure; and fourth, the relation of the substances or items seized to the person/s alleged to have been in possession of or peddling them. (Id.)


- Compliance with this requirement forecloses opportunities for planting, contaminating, or tampering of evidence in any manner; conversely, noncompliance results in "a concomitant failure on the part of the prosecution to establish the identity of the corpus delicti," leading to the prosecution's failure to prove the accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. (Id.)


- Courts must employ heightened scrutiny, consistent with the requirements of proof beyond reasonable doubt, in evaluating case involving minuscule amounts of drugs. These can readily be planted and tampered. (Id.)


- In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Possession of Dangerous Drugs under RA 9165, as amended by RA 10640, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime; failing to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and hence, warrants an acquittal. (People vs. Esguerra a.k.a. "RR," G.R. 243986, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In People v. Lorenzo, this Court emphasized that moral certainty is not only required in proving the elements of illegal sale and dangerous drugs, but also in proving the identity of the seized drug. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- In People v. Tomawis, this Court emphasized that in planned buy-bust operations, because the seized items must be physically inventoried and photographed immediately upon seizure, the third-party witnesses must be present as early as during the actual transaction; their insulating presence serves the two-fold purpose of guaranteeing the legitimacy of the buy-bust operation and the integrity of the seized illicit drug: the presence of the three witnesses must be secured not only during the inventory but more importantly at the time of the warrantless arrest. (Id.)


- Noncompliance with Section 21 casts doubt on the integrity of the corpus delicti, and essentially, on accused's guilt; considering that the constitutional presumption of innocence mandates proof beyond reasonable doubt, "conviction cannot be sustained if there is a persistent doubt on the identity of the drug"; acquittal thus, ensues. (People vs. Sebilleno, G.R. 221457, Jan. 13, 2020)


- Section 21, Article II of Republic Act No. 9165 "is a matter of substantive law and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects"; it "spells out matters that are imperative"; even performing actions, which seemingly near compliance but do not really conform to its requisites, is not enough. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Section 21(1) of R.A. 9165 outlined the procedure to be followed by the apprehending officers in the seizure, initial custody, and handling of confiscated illegal drugs and/or paraphernalia. (People vs. Dadang a.k.a. "Manoy," G.R. 242880, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Section 21(1) of R.A. 10640 provides a saving clause: "that noncompliance of these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures and custody over said items." (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The chain of custody is "the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs of each stage, from the time of seizure or confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction"; as a means of verifying evidence, it demands "that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by proof sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be." (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The chain of custody over the seized drug remained unbroken, and the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti had been properly preserved; hence, accused-appellant's conviction must stand. (People vs. Esguerra a.k.a. "RR," G.R. 243986, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The chain of custody rule warrants that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The Implementing Rules allow the conduct of inventory of the seized items and taking of photographs "at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable"; deviations from the law may be excused, but the prosecution must plead and prove a justifiable ground. (People vs. Sebilleno, G.R. 221457, Jan. 13, 2020)


- The initial link in the chain of custody is the marking of the confiscated illicit drugs; marking precludes any contamination, switching or planting of evidence; through it, the evidence is separated from the corpus of other similar and correlated evidence, starting from confiscation until its disposal at the close of criminal proceedings. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The non-observance of the procedure mandated by Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended, casts serious doubt if the illegal drugs presented in court are the same illegal drugs seized. (People vs. Sali a.k.a. "Tapang/Pang," G.R. 236596, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The prosecution failed to comply with the requirements of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, and to provide justifiable grounds for such noncompliance; this creates reasonable doubt on the identity of the illegal drugs seized, ultimately warranting accused-appellant's acquittal. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- To be at par with the rule on the chain of custody, the marking of the confiscated articles should be undertaken: (1) in the presence of the accused; and (2) immediately upon seizure; this effectively guarantees that the articles seized are the same items that entered the chain and are eventually the ones offered in evidence. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime. (People vs. De Dios @ "Tata," G.R. 243664, Jan. 22, 2020)


- To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime; as part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, inter alia, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same. (People vs. Esguerra a.k.a. "RR," G.R. 243986, Jan. 22, 2020) (People vs. Fornillos @ "Intoy", G.R. 231991, Jan. 27, 2020)


- While the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and the IRR does not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items as void and invalid, the prosecution must satisfactorily prove that (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. (Edangalino vs. People, G.R. 235110, Jan. 8, 2020)

Illegal possession of dangerous drugs 
- As to the illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the following elements should be ascertained: [1] the accused was in possession of dangerous drugs; [2] such possession was not authorized by law; and [3] the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of dangerous drugs. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- In cases of Illegal Sale and Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under R.A. 9165, as amended, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime; failing to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and, hence, warrants an acquittal. (People vs. Dadang a.k.a. "Manoy," G.R. 242880, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In prosecuting a case for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the following elements must concur: (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object which is identified as a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug. (Id.)


- Prosecution for illegal possession of prohibited drugs necessitates that the elemental act of possession of a prohibited substance be established with moral certainty, together with the fact that the same is not authorized by law. (Edangalino vs. People, G.R. 235110, Jan. 8, 2020)


- The elements for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, as penalized in Section 11 of Republic Act No. 9165, are: "(1) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug." (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)

Illegal possession of drug paraphernalia 
- For a conviction for illegal possession of drug paraphernalia to prosper, it is primordial to show that the accused was in possession or control of any equipment, paraphernalia, and the like, which was fit or intended for smoking, consuming, and administering, among other acts, dangerous drugs into the body; and such possession was not authorized by law. (People vs. Dadang a.k.a. "Manoy," G.R. 242880, Jan. 22, 2020)

Illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs 
- The elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 are: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; while the elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 are: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug. (People vs. Fornillos @ "Intoy", G.R. 231991, Jan. 27, 2020)

- In a prosecution for illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the following elements must be established: (1) proof that the transaction or sale took place; (2) presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug as evidence; and (3) identification of the buyer and seller; what is material in a prosecution for illegal sale of drugs is the proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti as evidence. (People vs. Dadang a.k.a. "Manoy," G.R. 242880, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In every prosecution for the crime of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165, the following elements must be proven beyond reasonable doubt: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment. (People vs. Esguerra a.k.a. "RR," G.R. 243986, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In order to guarantee a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must prove the following: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of RA 9165 are: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; while the elements of Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under Section 11, Article II of RA 9165 are: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug. (People vs. De Dios @ "Tata," G.R. 243664, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The elements to sustain convictions for violation of Section 5 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act, or the illegal sale of dangerous drugs are "(1) proof that the transaction or sale took place and (2) the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug as evidence." (People vs. Sebilleno, G.R. 221457, Jan. 13, 2020)


- The illegal sale of dangerous drugs is punished under Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165; its elements are the following: "(1) proof that the transaction or sale took place and (2) the presentation in court of the corpus delicti or the illicit drug as evidence." (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The occurrence of the sale should be established; the object of the deal should also be offered as evidence and must similarly be proven as the same one confiscated from the accused. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 or illegal sale of prohibited drugs, in order to be convicted of the said violation, the following must concur: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Sali a.k.a. "Tapang/Pang," G.R. 236596, Jan. 29, 2020)

Witnesses rule 
- The absence of the required witnesses does not per se make the seized articles inadmissible as evidence but the prosecution must prove that it has acceptable reason for such failure, or a showing that it exerted genuine and sufficient effort to secure their presence. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)

#### COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002 (R.A. 9165), AS AMENDED BY R.A. 10640

Chain of custody 
- In the present case, there was a strict compliance with the chain of custody rule under Section 21 (1) of R.A. 9165 which specifies that: the apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice, and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (People vs. Amago, G.R. 227739, Jan. 15, 2020)


- R.A. 10640 amended Section 21 of R.A. 9165 and incorporated the saving clause contained in the IRR, and requires that the conduct of the physical inventory and taking of photograph of the seized items be done in the presence of (1) the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel; (2) an elected public official; and (3) a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media. (Edangalino vs. People, G.R. 235110, Jan. 8, 2020)

Illegal transportation of dangerous drugs 
- The very act of transporting a prohibited drug, like in the instant case, is a malum prohibitum since it is punished as an offense under a special law; the mere commission of the act constitutes the offense and is sufficient to validly charge and convict an individual committing the act, regardless of criminal intent; since the crime is malum prohibitum, it is inconsequential to prove that the illegal drugs were delivered or transported to another person; the only thing that had to be proven was the movement of the illegal drugs from one place to another. (People vs. Amago, G.R. 227739, Jan. 15, 2020)


- "Transport" as used under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 means "to carry or convey from one place to another"; the essential element of the charge is the movement of the dangerous drug from one place to another; there is no definitive moment when an accused "transports" a prohibited drug; when the circumstances establish the purpose of an accused to transport and the fact of transportation itself, there should be no question as to the perpetration of the criminal act. (Id.)

#### CONDOMINIUM ACT (R.A. 4726)

Application of 
- As held in Yamane, "the profit motive in such cases is hardly the driving factor behind such improvements, if it were contemplated at all; any profit that would be derived under such circumstances would merely be incidental, if not accidental"; a condominium corporation is especially formed for the purpose of holding title to the common area and exists only for the benefit of the condominium owners. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Section 9 allows a condominium corporation to provide for the means by which it should be managed; it authorizes a condominium corporation to collect association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges for: a) maintenance of insurance policies; b) maintenance, utility, gardening and other services benefiting the common areas, for the employment of personnel necessary for the operation of the building, and legal, accounting and other professional and technical services; c) purchase of materials, supplies and the like needed by the common areas; d) reconstruction of any portion or portions of any damage to or destruction of the project; and e) reasonable assessments to meet authorized expenditures. (Id.)


- To enable the orderly administration over these common areas which the unit owners jointly own, RA 4726 permits the creation of a condominium corporation for the purpose of holding title to the common areas; the unit owners shall in proportion to the appurtenant interests of their respective units automatically be members or shareholders of the condominium corporation to the exclusion of others. (Id.)

Condominium 
- Under the law, a condominium is an interest in real property consisting of a separate interest in a unit in a residential, industrial or commercial building and an undivided interest in common, directly or indirectly, in the land on which it is located and in other common areas of the building. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### CONSPIRACY

Existence of 
- For conspiracy to exist, it is essential that there must be a conscious design to commit an offense; conspiracy is the product of intentionality on the part of the cohorts; it is necessary that a conspirator should have performed some overt act as a direct or indirect contribution to the execution of the crime committed; the overt act may consist of active participation in the actual commission of the crime itself, or it may consist of moral assistance to his co-conspirators by being present at the commission of the crime or by exerting moral ascendancy over the other co-conspirators. (People vs. Amago, G.R. 227739, Jan. 15, 2020)


- In People v. Lababo, citing Bahilidad v. People, the Court summarized the basic principles in determining whether conspiracy exists or not; thus: there is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it; conspiracy is not presumed; like the physical acts constituting the crime itself, the elements of conspiracy must be proven beyond reasonable doubt; while conspiracy need not be established by direct evidence, for it may be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, all taken together, however, the evidence must be strong enough to show the community of criminal design. (Id.)


- The mere presence of an accused at the discussion of a conspiracy, even approval of it, without any active participation in the same, is not enough for purposes of conviction; conspiracy is said to exist where two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it; it can be proven by evidence of a chain of circumstances and may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime which indubitably point to and are indicative of a joint purpose, concert of action and community of interest. (Id.)

#### CONTEMPT

Indirect contempt 
- Indirect contempt is committed through any of the acts enumerated under Section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court; indirect contempt is only punished after a written petition is filed and an opportunity to be heard is given to the party charged. (Britania vs. Hon. Gepty in her capacity as Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Valenzuela City, et al., G.R. 246995, Jan. 22, 2020)

Power of 
- The power to declare a person in contempt of court and in dealing with him or her accordingly is an inherent power lodged in courts of justice, to be used as a means to protect and preserve the dignity of the court, the solemnity of the proceedings therein, and the administration of justice from callous misbehavior, offensive personalities, and contumacious refusal to comply with court orders; this contempt power, however plenary it may seem, must be exercised judiciously and sparingly with utmost self-restraint with the end in view of utilizing the same for correction and preservation of the dignity of the court, not for retaliation or vindication. (Britania vs. Hon. Gepty in her capacity as Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Valenzuela City, et al., G.R. 246995, Jan. 22, 2020)

Types of 
- There are two (2) types of contempt of court: (i) direct contempt and (ii) indirect contempt; direct contempt consists of misbehavior in the presence of or so near a court as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before it; it includes: (i) disrespect to the court, (ii) offensive behavior against others, (iii) refusal, despite being lawfully required, to be sworn in or to answer as a witness, or to subscribe an affidavit or deposition; it can be punished summarily without a hearing. (Britania vs. Hon. Gepty in her capacity as Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Valenzuela City, et al., G.R. 246995, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### CONTRACTS

Consensual contracts 
- As a contract is consensual in nature, it is perfected upon the concurrence of the offer and the acceptance; the offer must be certain and the acceptance must be absolute, unconditional and without variance of any sort from the proposal. (Catapang vs. Lipa Bank, G.R. 240645, Jan. 27, 2020)

Elements 
- A contract is a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service; there can be no contract unless all of the following requisites concur: (1) consent of the contracting parties; (2) object certain which is the subject matter of the contract; and (3) the cause of the obligation which is established; when one of the elements is wanting, no contract can be perfected. (Catapang vs. Lipa Bank, G.R. 240645, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Consent, in turn, is the acceptance by one of the offer made by the other; it is the meeting of the minds of the parties on the object and the cause which constitutes the contract; the area of agreement must extend to all points that the parties deem material or there is no consent at all. (Id.)

Interpretation of 
- Article 1332 of the Civil Code states that when a contract is in a language not understood by one of the parties, and mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract has the burden of proving that the terms of the contract were fully explained to the contracting party. (Catapang vs. Lipa Bank, G.R. 240645, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Article 1332 was intended for the protection of a party to a contract who is at a disadvantage due to his illiteracy, ignorance, mental weakness or other handicap; this article contemplates a situation wherein a contract has been entered into, but the consent of one of the parties is vitiated by mistake or fraud committed by the other contracting party. (Id.)

Principle of relativity of contracts 
- Pursuant to the principle of relativity of contracts under Article 1311 of the Civil Code, which provides that "contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns and heirs, except in case where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law." (Llorent vs. Star City PTY Limited, represented by the Jimeno, G.R. 212050, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### CO-OWNERSHIP

Concept of 
- A reading of Article 147 of the Family Code would show that the provision did not make any distinction or make any qualification in terms of the manner the property must be acquired before the presumption of co-ownership shall apply; as such, the term "acquired" must be taken in its ordinary acceptation. (Paterno vs. Paterno, G.R. 213687, Jan. 08, 2020)


- For as long as the properties had been purchased, whether on installment, financing or other mode of payment, during the period of cohabitation, the disputable presumption that they have been obtained by the parties' joint efforts, work or industry, and shall be owned by them in equal share, shall arise. (Id.)


- If the respondent is able to present proof that she contributed through her salary, income, work or industry in the acquisition of the properties, the parties' share shall be in proportion to their contributions; in the event that the respondent had not been able to contribute through her salary, income, work or industry, but was able to show that she cared for and maintained the family and the household, her efforts shall be deemed the equivalent of the contributions made by the petitioner. (Id.)


- The presumption that the properties are co-owned and thus must be shared equally is not conclusive but merely disputable; the petitioner may rebut the presumption by presenting proof that the properties, although acquired during the period of their cohabitation, were not obtained through their joint efforts, work and industry. (Id.)

Interest 
- When there is a finding of illegal dismissal and an award of backwages and separation pay, the decision also becomes a judgment for money from which another consequence flows the payment of legal interest in case of delay imposable upon the total unpaid judgment amount, from the time the decision became final. (Prime Stars International Promotion Corporation, et al. vs. Baybayan, et al., G.R. 213961, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### COURT OF TAX APPEALS

Jurisdiction 
- On August 16, 2016, in Banco de Oro v. Republic of the Phils., et al., the Court en banc pronounced in no uncertain terms that the Court of Tax Appeals had jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality or validity of a tax law or regulation or administrative issuance. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- On February 4, 2014, the Court en banc recognized that the Court of Tax Appeals possessed all such implied, inherent and incidental powers necessary to the full and effective exercise of its appellate jurisdiction over tax cases; City of Manila v. Judge Grecia-Cuerdo is relevant, thus: a grant of appellate jurisdiction implies that there is included in it the power necessary to exercise it effectively, to make all orders that will preserve the subject of the action, and to give effect to the final determination of the appeal. (Id.)

#### COURT PERSONNEL

Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service 
- It refers to acts or omissions that violate the norm of public accountability and diminish, or tend to diminish, the people's faith in the Judiciary. (Valdez vs. Alviar, Sheriff IV, A.M. No. P-20-4042, Jan. 28, 2020)

Duties 
- In order to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice, they must exemplify the highest sense of honesty and integrity. (Re: Alleged Dishonesty and Falsification of Civil Service Eligibility of Mr. Samuel R. Runez, Jr., Cashier III, Checks Disbursement Division, Financial Management Office-Office of the Court Administrator, A.M. No. 2019-18-SC, Jan. 28, 2020)


- The Court has always emphasized that all members of the judiciary should be free from any whiff of impropriety, not only with respect to their duties in the judicial branch but also to their behavior outside the court as private individuals, in order that the integrity and good name of the courts of justice be preserved. (Ambrosio vs. Delas Armas, Sheriff IV, Branch 265, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, A.M. No. P-14-3188, Jan. 28, 2020)


- The image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of its personnel; in truth, all court personnel are mandated to adhere to the strictest standards of honesty, integrity, morality, and decency. (Re: Alleged Dishonesty and Falsification of Civil Service Eligibility of Mr. Samuel R. Runez, Jr., Cashier III, Checks Disbursement Division, Financial Management Office-Office of the Court Administrator, A.M. No. 2019-18-SC, Jan. 28, 2020)

Falsification of official document and serious dishonesty 
- His act of using a falsified Certificate of Civil Service Professional Level Eligibility for the purpose of securing employment with the Court and later supporting his bid for promotion constitutes falsification of official document and serious dishonesty. (Re: Alleged Dishonesty and Falsification of Civil Service Eligibility of Mr. Samuel R. Runez, Jr., Cashier III, Checks Disbursement Division, Financial Management Office-Office of the Court Administrator, A.M. No. 2019-18-SC, Jan. 28, 2020)


- In the absence of a satisfactory explanation, a person who has in his or her possession or control a falsified document and who makes use of the same, is presumed to be the forger or the one who caused its forgery. (Id.)

Grave misconduct 
- Court personnel cannot take advantage of the vulnerability of desperate party-litigants for monetary gain: grave misconduct merits dismissal; in some cases, the court exercised its discretion to assess mitigating circumstances such as length of service or the fact that a transgression might be the first infraction of respondent. (Ambrosio vs. Delas Armas, Sheriff IV, Branch 265, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, A.M. No. P-14-3188, Jan. 28, 2020)

Gross neglect of duty 
- Respondent's repeated carelessness and inefficiency in the performance of his assigned task had caused great inconvenience to the judge and the litigants warranting a finding of guilt for gross neglect of duty. (Arce, Clerk III, Branch 122, Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City vs. Tauro, former Court Interpreter, Branch 122, Regional Trial Court, Caloocan City, A.M. No. P-20-4035, Jan. 28, 2020)

Liability of 
- Being an employee of the Supreme Court, a high degree of comportment and decorum is expected from the respondent; his acts, whether part of his official duties or in his private capacity, reflect upon the Court as an institution; it also bears stressing that even if the act was committed after office hours and was not in any way connected with his official duties, respondent must still be held accountable. (Re: Incident Report on the Alleged Improper Conduct of Allan Christer C. Castillo, Driver I, Motorpool Section, Property Division, Office of Administrative Services, A.M. No. 2019-08-SC, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Jurisprudence dictates that the issue in administrative cases is not whether the complainant has a cause of action against the respondent, but whether the employee concerned has breached the norms and standards of the judiciary. (Valdez vs. Alviar, Sheriff IV, A.M. No. P-20-4042, Jan. 28, 2020)


- The administrative liability of court personnel who are not judges or justices of the lower courts shall be governed by the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, which incorporates, among others, the civil service laws and rules; under the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, Simple Misconduct may be penalized by one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months suspension for the first offense. (Re: Incident Report on the Alleged Improper Conduct of Allan Christer C. Castillo, Driver I, Motorpool Section, Property Division, Office of Administrative Services, A.M. No. 2019-08-SC, Jan. 15, 2020)

Misconduct 
- In order to differentiate gross misconduct from simple misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, and not a mere error of judgment, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest in the former. (Ambrosio vs. Delas Armas, Sheriff IV, Branch 265, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, A.M. No. P-14-3188, Jan. 28, 2020) (Sarno-Davin, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19 vs. Quirante, Clerk III, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19, A.M. No. P-19-4021, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer; it is intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior and to constitute an administrative offense, the misconduct should relate to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and duties of a public officer. (Ambrosio vs. Delas Armas, Sheriff IV, Branch 265, Regional Trial Court, Pasig City, A.M. No. P-14-3188, Jan. 28, 2020) (Sarno-Davin, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19 vs. Quirante, Clerk III, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19, A.M. No. P-19-4021, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer; the misconduct is grave if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence. (Valdez vs. Alviar, Sheriff IV, A.M. No. P-20-4042, Jan. 28, 2020)

Neglect of duty 
- Neglect of duty is the failure of a public official or employee to give attention to a task expected of him; the public official or employee of the Judiciary responsible for such act or omission cannot escape the disciplinary power of this Court; simple neglect of duty is contrasted from gross neglect; gross neglect of duty refers to negligence characterized by the glaring want of care; by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently, but willfully and intentionally; or by acting with a conscious indifference to consequences with respect to other persons who may be affected. (Sarno-Davin, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19 vs. Quirante, Clerk III, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19, A.M. No. P-19-4021, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### COURTS

Hierarchy of courts 
- As correctly pointed out by petitioners, we have provided exceptions to this doctrine: first, a direct resort to this court is allowed when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time; a direct resort to this court includes availing of the remedies of certiorari and prohibition to assail the constitutionality of actions of both legislative and executive branches of the government; a second exception is when the issues involved are of transcendental importance; in these cases, the imminence and clarity of the threat to fundamental constitutional rights outweigh the necessity for prudence; the doctrine relating to constitutional issues of transcendental importance prevents courts from the paralysis of procedural niceties when clearly faced with the need for substantial protection; third, cases of first impression warrant a direct resort to this court; in cases of first impression, no jurisprudence yet exists that will guide the lower courts on this matter; fourth, the constitutional issues raised are better decided by this court; there is transcendental interest in determining whether a penal statute with grave consequences to the life and liberty of those charged under it is consistent with our constitutional principles. (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)


- The doctrine on hierarchy of courts is determinative of the appropriate venue where petitions for extraordinary writs should be filed; parties cannot randomly select the court or forum to which their actions will be directed. (Id.)


- The doctrine that requires respect for the hierarchy of courts was created by this court to ensure that every level of the judiciary performs its designated roles in an effective and efficient manner; this Court will not entertain direct resort to it when relief can be obtained in the lower courts; this holds especially true when questions of fact are raised. (Id.)


- This court has "full discretionary power to take cognizance and assume jurisdiction over special civil actions for certiorari filed directly with it for exceptionally compelling reasons or if warranted by the nature of the issues clearly and specifically raised in the petition." (Id.)

#### CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Complaint or information 
- Amendments that do not charge another offense different from that charged in the original one; or do not alter the prosecution's theory of the case so as to cause surprise to the accused and affect the form of defense he has or will assume are considered merely as formal amendments. (Quiambao vs. People, G.R. 195957, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Section 14, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the matter of amending the information: there is no precise definition of what constitutes a substantial amendment; according to jurisprudence, substantial matters in the complaint or information consist of the recital of facts constituting the offense charged and determinative of the jurisdiction of the court; under Section 14, however, the prosecution is given the right to amend the information, regardless of the nature of the amendment, so long as the amendment is sought before the accused enters his plea, subject to the qualification under second paragraph of Section 14. (Id.)


- The amendments to the original information for the crime of estafa, specifying the various dates of the acts complained of, are merely formal and not substantial, as the same do not amount to a change in the nature of the charges such that the accused would have to prepare a new defense, and it would not cause prejudice to the accused such that a new preliminary investigation would be necessary to accord him due process. (Id.)

Jurisdiction 
- In De Lima v. Reyes, this Court held that "once the information is filed in court, the court acquires jurisdiction of the case and any motion to dismiss the case or to determine the accused's guilt or innocence rests within the sound discretion of the court"; the filing of the information initiates the criminal action before the court, and the preliminary investigation by the prosecution is terminated. (Beltran, et al. vs. Sandiganbayan (Second Division), et al., G.R. 201117, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In De Lima: whether the accused had been arraigned or not and whether it was due to a reinvestigation by the fiscal or a review by the Secretary of Justice whereby a motion to dismiss was submitted to the Court, the Court in the exercise of its discretion may grant the motion or deny it and require that the trial on the merits proceed for the proper determination of the case. (Id.)

Motion for reconsideration 
- The notification prays for the submission of the motion for reconsideration for hearing but without stating the time, date, and place of the hearing of the motion; this is not the notice of hearing contemplated under Sections 4 and 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court; the notice of hearing shall state the time and place of hearing and shall be served upon all the parties concerned at least three days in advance. (Latogan vs. People, G.R. 238298, Jan. 22, 2020)

Motion to quash 
- A motion to quash an information may be filed at any time before a plea is entered by the accused; the accused may move to quash an information on constitutional grounds, based on the theory that there can be no crime if there is no law, the law being invalid (nullum crimen sine lege). (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)

Preliminary investigation 
- A preliminary investigation is merely inquisitorial and is only conducted to aid the prosecutor in preparing the information; it is preparatory to a trial; an accused's right to a preliminary investigation is purely statutory; it is not a right guaranteed by the Constitution; even if there are alleged irregularities in an investigation's conduct, this neither renders the information void nor impairs its validity. (Arroyo vs. Sandiganbayan Fifth Division, et al., G.R. 210488, Jan. 27, 2020)


- At the preliminary investigation, the Ombudsman determines probable cause which merely involves weighing of facts and circumstances and relying on common sense, without resorting to technical rules of evidence; a preliminary investigation is simply an inquisitorial mode of discovering whether or not there is reasonable basis to believe that a crime has been committed and that the person charged should be held responsible for it. (Id.)

Probable cause 
- For purposes of filing a criminal information, probable cause pertains to facts and circumstances sufficient to create a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof; as such, a finding of probable cause does not require an inquiry on whether there is sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. (Miraflores, et al. vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. Nos. 238103 & 238223, Jan. 5, 2020)


- In Leviste v. Almeda: to move the court to conduct a judicial determination of probable cause is a mere superfluity, for with or without such motion, the judge is duty-bound to personally evaluate the resolution of the public prosecutor and the supporting evidence; in fact, the task of the presiding judge when the Information is filed with the court is first and foremost to determine the existence or non-existence of probable cause for the arrest of the accused. (Arroyo vs. Sandiganbayan Fifth Division, et al., G.R. 210488, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Jurisprudence has consistently ruled in favor of non-interference in the Ombudsman's determination of the existence of probable cause, unless there is a clear showing of grave abuse of discretion; this policy is based on respect for the Ombudsman's mandate and on practical grounds. (Id.)


- Probable cause is defined as the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he was prosecuted. (Id.)


- The executive determination of probable cause is a highly factual matter; it requires probing into the "existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite the belief, in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he or she was prosecuted." (Id.)


- The Ombudsman's executive determination of probable cause is different from the judicial determination of probable cause; the determination of probable cause for the purpose of filing an information is a function within the exclusive sphere and competence of the Ombudsman; the courts must respect the exercise of discretion when an information filed against a person is valid on its face, and that no manifest error or grave abuse of discretion can be imputed to the public prosecutor. (Id.)


- This Court has already settled that motions for judicial determination of probable cause are superfluities, because the rules already direct the judge to make a personal finding of probable cause. (Id.)


- When an information is filed with the court, the court acquires jurisdiction of the case and a judicial determination of probable cause is made by the judge for the purpose of issuing a warrant of arrest; at this stage, any motion to dismiss the case or to determine the conviction or acquittal of the accused is within the sound discretion of the court. (Id.)

#### DAMAGES

Attorney's fees 
- In Tangga-an v. Philippine Transmarine Carriers, Inc., the Court, citing Kaisahan ng mga Manggagawa at Kawani sa MWC-East Zone Union v. Manila Water Company, Inc., upheld the award of attorney's fees in favor of an employee who had been illegally dismissed and impelled to litigate to protect his interests. (Seventh Fleet Security Services, Inc. vs. Loque, G.R. 230005, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The general rule is that attorney's fees cannot be recovered as part of damages because of the policy that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate; they are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit; the power of the court to award attorney's fees under Article 2208 demands factual, legal, and equitable justification; even when a claimant is compelled to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his rights, still attorney's fees may not be awarded where no sufficient showing of bad faith could be reflected in a party's persistence in a case other than an erroneous conviction of the righteousness of his cause. (Sian represented by Romualdo A. Sian vs. Spouses Somoso, the former being substituted by his surviving son, Anthony Voltaire B. Somoso, et al., G.R. 201812, Jan. 22, 2020)

Exemplary damages 
- The rule in our jurisdiction is that exemplary damages are awarded in addition to moral damages; in the case of Mahinay v. Velasquez, Jr., the Court pronounced: If the court has no proof or evidence upon which the claim for moral damages could be based, such indemnity could not be outrightly awarded; the same holds true with respect to the award of exemplary damages where it must be shown that the party acted in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner. (Sian represented by Romualdo A. Sian vs. Spouses Somoso, the former being substituted by his surviving son, Anthony Voltaire B. Somoso, et al., G.R. 201812, Jan. 22, 2020)

Moral damages 
- In Delos Santos v. Papa, the Court elucidated that the mere filing of an unmeritorious complaint does not ipso facto warrant the award of moral damages, to wit: Assuming arguendo that the petitioner's case lacked merit, the award of moral damages is not a legal consequence that automatically followed. (Odrada vs. Lazaro, et al., G.R. 205515, Jan. 20, 2020)


- In order for moral damages to be awarded, the following circumstances must concur: (1) there is an injury, whether physical, mental or psychological, clearly sustained by the claimant; (2) there is a culpable act or omission factually established; (3) the wrongful act or omission of the defendant is the proximate cause of the injury sustained by the claimant; and (4) the award of damages is predicated on any of the cases stated in Article 2219. (Id.)


- Malicious prosecution, for purposes of recovering moral damages, has been defined as "an action for damages brought by or against whom a criminal prosecution, civil suit or other legal proceeding has been instituted maliciously and without probable cause, after the termination of such prosecution, suit, or other proceeding in favor of the defendant therein. (Id.)


- Neither could Odrada be liable for moral damages on the ground of abuse of rights under Article 19 of the Civil Code; for there to be abuse of rights, the following must concur: (1) there is a legal right or duty; (2) which is exercised in bad faith; (3) for the sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another. (Id.)


- Traditionally, the term malicious prosecution has been associated with unfounded criminal actions; jurisprudence has also recognized malicious prosecution to include baseless civil suits intended to vex and humiliate the defendant despite the absence of a cause of action or probable cause; however, it should be stressed that the filing of an unfounded suit is not a ground for the grant of moral damages; otherwise, moral damages must every time be awarded in favor of the prevailing defendant against an unsuccessful plaintiff. (Sian represented by Romualdo A. Sian vs. Spouses Somoso, the former being substituted by his surviving son, Anthony Voltaire B. Somoso, et al., G.R. 201812, Jan. 22, 2020)

Nominal damages 
- It has been settled that nominal damages cannot co-exist with actual damages; nominal damages are adjudicated in order that a right of the plaintiff, which has been violated or invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him; since respondent has already been indemnified for the damages made on the leased premises, there is no more reason to further grant nominal damages. (Philippine-Japan Active Carbon Corporation vs. Borgaily, G.R. 197022, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### DECLARATORY RELIEF

Notice to the Solicitor General 
- In any action which involves the validity of a statute, executive order or regulation, or any other governmental regulation, the Solicitor General shall be notified by the party assailing the same and shall be entitled to be heard upon such question; the Rules only require that notice be given to the Solicitor General; they do not state that if the Solicitor General fails to participate in the action, the action would be dismissed. (Zomer Development Company, Inc. vs. Special Twentieth Division of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, et al., G.R. 194461, Jan. 7, 2020)

Petition for 
- A petition for declaratory relief may be treated as one for prohibition if the case has far-reaching implications and raises questions that need to be resolved for the public good; or if the assailed act or acts of executive officials are alleged to have usurped legislative authority. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020) (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- An action for declaratory relief should be filed by a person interested under a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, and whose rights are affected by a statute, executive order, regulation or ordinance before breach or violation thereof. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)


- CIR v. Standard Insurance, Co., Inc. further reinforced the rule that regional trial courts have no jurisdiction over petitions for declaratory relief against the imposition of tax liability or validity of tax assessments: The more substantial reason that should have impelled the RTC to desist from taking cognizance of the respondent's petition for declaratory relief except to dismiss the petition was its lack of jurisdiction. (Id.)


- Declaratory relief requires the following elements: (1) the subject matter of the controversy must be a deed, will, contract or other written instrument, statute, executive order or regulation, or ordinance; (2) the terms of said documents and the validity thereof are doubtful and require judicial construction; (3) there must have been no breach of the documents in question; (4) there must be an actual justiciable controversy or the "ripening seeds" of one between persons whose interests are adverse; (5) the issue must be ripe for judicial determination; and (6) adequate relief is not available through other means or other forms of action or proceeding. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Since there is no actual case involved in a petition for declaratory relief, it cannot be the proper vehicle to invoke the power of judicial review to declare a statute as invalid or unconstitutional. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The grant of declaratory relief is discretionary on the courts; courts may refuse to declare rights or to construe instruments if it will not terminate the controversy or if it is unnecessary and improper under the circumstances; a discretionary act cannot be the subject of a petition for mandamus. (Zomer Development Company, Inc. vs. Special Twentieth Division of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, et al., G.R. 194461, Jan. 7, 2020)


- The purpose of the action is to secure an authoritative statement of the rights and obligations of the parties under a statute, deed, contract, etc. for their guidance in its enforcement or compliance and not to settle issues arising from its alleged breach; it may be entertained only before the breach or violation of the statute, deed, contract, etc. to which it refers. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)


- There is no actual case involved in a Petition for Declaratory Relief; it cannot, therefore, be the proper vehicle to invoke the judicial review powers to declare a statute unconstitutional; to question the constitutionality of the subject issuances, respondents should have invoked the expanded certiorari jurisdiction under Section 1 of Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution; the adverted section defines judicial power as the power not only "to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable," but also "to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government." (Id.)


- Where the law or contract has already been contravened prior to the filing of an action for declaratory relief, the court can no longer assume jurisdiction over the action; in other words, a court has no more jurisdiction over an action for declaratory relief if its subject, i.e., the statute, deed, contract, etc., has already been infringed or transgressed before the institution of the action. (Id.)

#### DENIAL

Defense of 
- Denial is an inherently weak defense; absent any clear and convincing evidence, bare denial will not outweigh an affirmative testimony from a credible witness; without "any showing of ill motive on the part of the eyewitness testifying on the matter, a categorical, consistent and positive identification of the accused prevails over denial and alibi." (People vs. Pitulan, G.R. 226486, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Positive identification of petitioner as their father's assailant prevailed over petitioner's mere denial, because such denial, being negative and self-serving evidence, was undeserving of weight by virtue of its lack of substantiation by clear and convincing proof. (Patungan, Jr. vs. People, G.R. 231827, Jan. 20, 2020)

#### DIRECT ASSAULT

Commission of 
- Direct assault may be carried out in two (2) modes: (1) through committing an act equivalent to rebellion or sedition, but without public uprising; and (2) through employing force and resisting any person in authority while engaged in the performance of duties; the elements of the second mode of direct assault are as follows: appellants committed the second form of assault, the elements of which are: 1) that there must be an attack, use of force, or serious intimidation or resistance upon a person in authority or his agent; 2) the assault was made when the said person was performing his duties or on the occasion of such performance; and 3) the accused knew that the victim is a person in authority or his agent, that is, that the accused must have the intention to offend, injure or assault the offended party as a person in authority or an agent of a person in authority. (People vs. Pitulan, G.R. 226486, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### DUE PROCESS

Administrative due process 
- Administrative due process cannot be fully equated with due process in its strict judicial sense, for in the former a formal or trial-type hearing is not always necessary, and technical rules of procedure are not strictly applied; the essence of due process, therefore, as applied to administrative proceedings, is an opportunity to explain one's side, or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of. (Soliva vs. Dr. Tanggol, in his capacity as Chancellor of Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT), G.R. 223429, Jan. 29, 2020)


- In administrative proceedings, due process is satisfied when a person is notified of the charge against him and given an opportunity to explain or defend oneself; in such proceedings, the filing of charges and giving reasonable opportunity for the person so charged to answer the accusations against him constitute the minimum requirements of due process. (Id.)

Procedural due process 
- The Court delineated the requirements of procedural due process in King of Kings Transport, Inc. v. Mamac, viz.: (1) The first written notice to be served on the employees should contain the specific causes or grounds for termination against them, and a directive that the employees are given the opportunity to submit their written explanation within a reasonable period; "reasonable opportunity" under the Omnibus Rules means every kind of assistance that management must accord to the employees to enable them to prepare adequately for their defense; this should be construed as a period of at least five (5) calendar days from receipt of the notice to give the employees an opportunity to study the accusation against them, consult a union official or lawyer, gather data and evidence, and decide on the defenses they will raise against the complaint. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)

Substantive and procedural due process 
- In an illegal dismissal case, the onus probandi rests on the employer to prove that the employee's dismissal was for a valid cause; a valid dismissal requires compliance with both substantive and procedural due process, that is, the dismissal must be for any of the just or authorized causes enumerated in Article 297 [282] and Article 298 [283], respectively, of the Labor Code, and only after notice and hearing. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)

#### EMPLOYMENT, TERMINATION OF

Abandonment 
- Abandonment, as a just cause for termination, requires "a deliberate and unjustified refusal of an employee to resume his work, coupled with a clear absence of any intention of returning to his or her work." (Seventh Fleet Security Services, Inc. vs. Loque, G.R. 230005, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The following elements must therefore concur: (1) the failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship, with the second element as the more determinative factor and being manifested by some overt acts. (Id.)

Backwages 
- Our labor laws dictate that backwages must be computed from the time the employee was unjustly dismissed until his or her actual reinstatement or upon payment of his or her separation pay if reinstatement is no longer feasible; insofar as accrued backwages and other benefits are concerned, the employer's obligation to the employee continues to accumulate until he actually implements the reinstatement aspect of the final judgment or fully satisfies the monetary award in case reinstatement is no longer possible. (Tan and/or C&L Lending Investor vs. Dagpin, G.R. 212111, Jan. 15, 2020)

Constructive dismissal 
- An employee is considered to be constructively dismissed from service if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain by an employer has become so unbearable to the employee as to leave him or her with no option but to forego his or her continued employment. (Al-Masiya Overseas Placement Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Viernes, G.R. 216132, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In cases of constructive dismissal, the impossibility, unreasonableness, or unlikelihood of continued employment leaves an employee with no other viable recourse but to terminate his or her employment. (Id.)


- It can be inferred that various situations, whereby the employer intentionally places the employee in a situation which will result in the latter's being coerced into severing his ties with the former, can result in constructive dismissal. (Id.)


- Similar to the case of Torreda, herein respondent was made to copy and sign a prepared resignation letter and this was made as a condition for the release of her passport and plane ticket; in light of these, the Court finds that, indeed, it was logical for respondent to consider herself constructively dismissed; the impossibility, unreasonableness, or unlikelihood of continued employment has left respondent with no other viable recourse but to terminate her employment. (Id.)

Floating status or temporary off-detail of employees 
- "Floating status" or temporary "off-detail" of employees, the Court, applying Article 301 [286] of the Labor Code by analogy, considers this situation as a form of temporary retrenchment or lay-off; Article 301 [286] of the Labor Code reads: ART. 301. [286] When Employment not Deemed Terminated. The bona fide suspension of the operation of a business or undertaking for a period not exceeding six (6) months, . . .; in all such cases, the employer shall reinstate the employee to his former position without loss of seniority rights if he indicates his desire to resume his work not later than one (1) month from the resumption of operations of his employer or from his relief from the military or civic duty. (Seventh Fleet Security Services, Inc. vs. Loque, G.R. 230005, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Placing an employee on floating status for more than six months without being deployed to a specific assignment is tantamount to constructive dismissal. (Id.)


- The placement of an employee on "floating status" must not exceed six months; otherwise, the employee may be considered constructively dismissed; the burden of proving that there are no posts available to which the security guard can be assigned rests on the employer; however, the mere lapse of six months in "floating status" should not automatically result to constructive dismissal; the peculiar circumstances of the employee's failure to assume another post must still be inquired upon. (Id.)

Insubordination 
- Insubordination or willful disobedience requires the concurrence of the following requisites: (1) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful or intentional, the willfulness being characterized by a "wrongful and perverse attitude"; and (2) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)

Neglect of duties 
- Jurisprudence provides that in order to constitute a valid cause for dismissal, the neglect of duties must be both gross and habitual; gross negligence has been defined as "the want or absence of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care; it evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them"; on the other hand, habitual neglect "imparts repeated failure to perform one's duties for a period of time, depending on the circumstances; a single or isolated act of negligence does not constitute a just cause for the dismissal of the employee. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)

Principle of totality of infractions 
- The totality of infractions or the number of violations committed during the period of employment shall be considered in determining the penalty to be imposed upon an erring employee; the offenses committed by petitioner should not be taken singly and separately. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)

Resignation 
- The employer still has the burden of proving that the resignation is voluntary despite the employer's claim that the employee resigned, which petitioners failed to discharge.(Prime Stars International Promotion Corporation, et al. vs. Baybayan, et al., G.R. 213961, Jan. 22, 2020)

Separation pay 
- As a general rule, an employee who has been dismissed for any of the just causes enumerated under Article 282 of the Labor Code is not entitled to a separation pay; in exceptional cases, however, the Court has granted separation pay to a legally dismissed employee as an act of "social justice" or on "equitable grounds"; in both instances, it is required that the dismissal (1) was not for serious misconduct; and (2) did not reflect on the moral character of the employee. (Herma Shipping and Transport Corporation vs. Cordero, G.R. 244144, Jan. 27, 2020)


- In the cases of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company v. NLRC and subsequently, Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. Workers Association v. NLRC, the Court stressed that "separation pay shall be allowed as a measure of social justice only in the instances where the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those reflecting on his moral character." (Id.)

Service incentive leave pay (SILP) 
- In RTG Construction, Inc. v. Facto, the Court awarded money claims, particularly SILP, despite the validity of the employee's dismissal; the first paragraph of Article 95 of the Labor Code provides that every employee who has rendered at least one year of service shall be entitled to a yearly incentive leave of five days with pay. (Villanueva vs. Ganco Resort and Recreation, Inc., et al., G.R. 227175, Jan. 8, 2020)

#### ESTAFA THROUGH FALSIFICATION OF COMMERCIAL DOCUMENTS

Commission of 
- For the crime of estafa through falsification of commercial documents, being a complex crime, the penalty for the more serious crime, which is estafa in this case, shall be imposed in its maximum period. (Soriano vs. People, G.R. 240458, Jan. 8, 2020)


- The falsification was, therefore, a necessary means to commit estafa, and falsification was already consummated even before the falsified documents were used to defraud the bank; the complex crime of estafa through falsification of documents is committed when the offender commits on a public, official or commercial document any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171 as a necessary means to commit estafa. (Id.)

#### EVIDENCE

Authentication and proof of documents 
- Under Section 20, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on Evidence, before a private document is admitted in evidence, it must be authenticated either by the person who executed it, the person before whom its execution was acknowledged, any person who was present and saw it executed, or who after its execution, saw it and recognized the signatures, or the person to whom the parties to the instruments had previously confessed execution thereof. (Catapang vs. Lipa Bank, G.R. 240645, Jan. 27, 2020)

Burden of proof 
- The Court cannot entertain "what-ifs" when the life and liberty of a person is at stake certainly, as "it is not proper to torture the minds of the members of this Court by placing them in the trying position of running the risk of convicting an innocent man, all because of the prosecution's failure to do its duty of gathering evidence to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt." (People vs. Dolandolan, G.R. 232157, Jan. 8, 2020)

Circumstantial evidence 
- An accused may be convicted when the circumstances established form an unbroken chain leading to one fair reasonable conclusion and pointing to the accused to the exclusion of all others as the guilty person. (People vs. Adalia, G.R. 235990, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Our rules on evidence and jurisprudence allow the conviction of an accused through circumstantial evidence alone, provided that the following requisites concur: (i) there is more than one circumstance; (ii) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (iii) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt. (Id.)

Direct evidence 
- People v. Pentecostes decreed that circumstantial evidence is by no means a "weaker" form of evidence vis-a-vis direct evidence; it elaborated: direct evidence of the commission of a crime is not indispensable to criminal prosecutions; a contrary rule would render convictions virtually impossible given that most crimes, by their very nature, are purposely committed in seclusion and away from eyewitnesses. (People vs. Adalia, G.R. 235990, Jan. 22, 2020)

Proof beyond reasonable doubt 
- In People v. Ganguso, this Court explained that the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal case is anchored on the constitutional guarantees of due process and of an accused's right to be presumed innocent; it held: An accused has in his favor the presumption of innocence which the Bill of Rights guarantees; unless his guilt is shown beyond reasonable doubt, he must be acquitted. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not, of course, mean such degree of proof as excluding possibility of error, produces absolute certainty; moral certainty only is required, or that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind; the conscience must be satisfied that the accused is responsible for the offense charged. (Id.)


- Proof beyond reasonable doubt, "or that quantum of proof sufficient to produce a moral certainty that would convince and satisfy the conscience of those who act in judgment," is crucial in overthrowing the presumption of innocence; in the event that the prosecution falls short of meeting the standard of evidence called for, it would be needless for the defense to offer evidence on its behalf; the presumption of innocence stands, and the accused is accordingly acquitted of the charge. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)


- This reasonable doubt standard is demanded by the due process clause of the Constitution which protects the accused from conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged; the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and unless it discharges that burden the accused need not even offer evidence in his behalf, and he would be entitled to an acquittal. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)

Public document 
- A death certificate is a public document; as a public document, it is admissible in evidence even without further proof of their due execution and genuineness. (Patungan, Jr. vs. People, G.R. 231827, Jan. 20, 2020)


- A notarized document has in its favor the presumption of regularity and the truthfulness of its contents; a notarized document, being a public document, is evidence of the fact which gave rise to its execution. (Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Macabagdal, represented by Eulogia Macabagdal-Pascual, G.R. 203948, Jan. 22, 2020)

Substantial evidence 
- In order to sustain a finding of culpability for the administrative offenses, substantial evidence is required, or such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; the standard of substantial evidence is satisfied when there is reasonable ground to believe that a person is responsible for the misconduct complained of. (Sarno-Davin, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19 vs. Quirante, Clerk III, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19, A.M. No. P-19-4021, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Time and again, the Court has ruled that in administrative proceedings, complainants bear the burden of proving the allegations in their complaints by substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. (Martin-Ortega vs. Tadena, A.C. No. 12018, Jan. 29, 2020)

Weight and sufficiency of 
- Reasonable doubt may arise from the evidence adduced or from the lack of evidence, and it should pertain to the facts constitutive of the crime charged; while no test definitively determines what is reasonable doubt under the law, the view is that it must involve genuine and irreconcilable contradictions based, not on suppositional thinking, but on the hard facts constituting the elements of the crime. (People vs. Carreon, G.R. 229086, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### EXPROPRIATION

Just compensation 
- Just compensation is defined as the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator; it is that sum of money which a person desirous but not compelled to buy, and an owner willing but not compelled to sell, would agree on as price to be given and received therefor; the measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss. (National Transmission Corporation, as Transferee-in-Interest of the National Power Corporation vs. Spouses Taglao, G.R. 223195, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Just compensation should be computed based on the fair value of the property at the time of its taking or the filing of the complaint, whichever came first. (Id.)


- The determination of just compensation indeed lies within the trial court's discretion, it should not be done arbitrarily or capriciously; the valuation of courts must be based on all established rules, correct legal principles, and competent evidence; the courts are proscribed from basing their judgments on speculations and surmises. (Id.)


- The just compensation should not only be 10 percent  of the market value of the subject property; in several cases, the Court struck down reliance on Section 3A of RA 6395, as amended by PD No. 938; an easement of a right of way transmits no rights except the easement itself, and the respondents would retain full ownership of the property taken; nonetheless, the acquisition of such easement is not gratis; the limitations on the use of the property taken for an indefinite period would deprive its owner of the normal use thereof. (Id.)


- While market value may be one of the basis in the determination of just compensation, the same cannot be arbitrarily arrived at without considering the factors to be appreciated in arriving at the fair market value of the property, e.g., the cost of acquisition, the current value of like properties, its size, shape, location, as well as the tax declarations thereon. (Id.)

#### FALSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS

Elements 
- The elements of falsification of documents under paragraph 1, Article 172 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) are: (1) that the offender is a private individual or a public officer or employee who did not take advantage of his official position; (2) that he committed any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171 of the RPC; and (3) that the falsification was committed in a public, official or commercial document. (Soriano vs. People, G.R. 240458, Jan. 8, 2020)

#### FAMILY CODE

Marriage 
- A Filipino who initiated a foreign divorce proceeding is in the same place and in like circumstance as a Filipino who is at the receiving end of an alien initiated proceeding; the subject provision should not make a distinction; in both instance, it is extended as a means to recognize the residual effect of the foreign divorce decree on Filipinos whose marital ties to their alien spouses are severed by operation of the latter's national law. (Galapon vs. Republic, G.R. 243722, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In the recent case of Manalo, the Court en banc extended the scope of Article 26(2) to even cover instances where the divorce decree is obtained solely by the Filipino spouse; the Court's ruling states, in part: to reiterate, the purpose of paragraph 2 of Article 26 is to avoid the absurd situation where the Filipino spouse remains married to the alien spouse who, after a foreign divorce decree that is effective in the country where it was rendered, is no longer married to the Filipino spouse. (Id.)


- Petitioner sufficiently established the authenticity and validity of the divorce decree obtained abroad; the divorce decree obtained by foreign spouse, with or without petitioner's conformity falls within the scope of Article 26(2) and merits recognition in this jurisdiction. (Id.)

Property relations 
- Since the petitioner and the respondent suffer no legal impediment and exclusively lived with each other under a void marriage, their property relation is one of co-ownership under Article 147 of the Family Code; the said provision finds application in this case even if the parties were married before the Family Code took effect by express provision of the Family Code on its retroactive effect for as long as it does not prejudice or impair vested or acquired rights in accordance with the Civil Code or other laws. (Paterno vs. Paterno, G.R. 213687, Jan. 08, 2020)


- The marriage of the petitioner and the respondent had long been declared an absolute nullity by reason of their psychological incapacity to perform their martial obligations to each other; the property relations of parties to a void marriage is governed either by Article 147 of 148 of the Family Code. (Id.)

Support 
- Anent the issue on the propriety of the increase in the amount of support, Article 198 of the Family Code provides that the obligation of mutual support between the spouses ceases when a judgment declaring a marriage void becomes final and executory. (Paterno vs. Paterno, G.R. 213687, Jan. 08, 2020)

#### FILING AND SERVICE

Pleadings, judgments and other papers 
- Where a party appears by attorney in an action or proceeding in a court of record, all notices must be served on the attorney of record; service of the court's order on any person other than the counsel of record is not legally effective, nay, binding on the party; nor may it start the corresponding reglementary period for the subsequent procedural steps which may be taken by the attorney; this rule is founded on considerations of fair play. (Tan and/or C&L Lending Investor vs. Dagpin, G.R. 212111, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### FORCIBLE ENTRY

Action for 
- As correctly observed by the RTC, Federico's entry in the premises of the subject property without the consent and knowledge of the registered owner, who was abroad at that time, clearly falls under stealth, defined in our jurisprudence as "any secret, sly or clandestine act to avoid discovery and to gain entrance into, or to remain within the residence of another without permission." (Madayag vs. Madayag, G.R. 217576, Jan. 20, 2020)


- Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court requires that in action for forcible entry, as in this case, it must be alleged that the complainant was deprived of the possession of any land or building by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth, and that the action was filed anytime within one year from the time the unlawful deprivation of possession took place, except that when the entry is through stealth, the one-year period is counted from the time the complainant learned of the dispossession. (Id.)


- The only question that courts must resolve in an ejectment case is who between the parties is entitled to the physical or material possession of the property in dispute; the main issue is possession de facto, independent of any claim of ownership or possession de jure; courts should base their decision on who had prior physical possession of the premises under litigation; as a rule, "possession" in forcible entry cases refers to nothing more than prior physical possession or possession de facto, not possession de jure or that arising from ownership. (Madayag vs. Madayag, G.R. 217576, Jan. 20, 2020)


- Title is not an issue; the Court has, however, consistently ruled that possession can be acquired not only by material or actual occupation, but also by the fact that a thing is subject to the action of one's will or by the proper acts and legal formalities established for acquiring such right; in Quizon v. Juan, the Court explained: possession can be acquired by juridical acts; these are acts to which the law gives the force of acts of possession. (Id.)

#### GENERAL BANKING LAW OF 2002 (R.A. 8791)

Section 47 
- In Goldenway Merchandising, this Court squarely addressed the argument that Republic Act No. 8791, Section 47 violated the equal protection clause when it provided a shorter redemption period for juridical persons. (Zomer Development Company, Inc. vs. Special Twentieth Division of the Court of Appeals, Cebu City, et al., G.R. 194461, Jan. 7, 2020)

#### INDETERMINATE SENTENCE LAW (R.A. 4103)

Application of 
- In imposing a prison sentence for an offense punishable by a law other than the Revised Penal Code, the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence, the minimum term of which shall not be less than the minimum fixed by law and the maximum of which shall not exceed the maximum term prescribed by the same. (People vs. Dadang a.k.a. "Manoy," G.R. 242880, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### INFANTICIDE

Elements 
- To convict an accused charged with infanticide, the following elements must be proved: (a) a child was killed; (b) the deceased child was less than three (3) days old; and (c) the accused killed the child. (People vs. Adalia, G.R. 235990, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### INTERESTS

Legal interest 
- The term "forbearance," within the context of usury law, has been described as a contractual obligation of a lender or creditor to refrain, during a given period of time, from requiring the borrower or debtor to repay the loan or debt then due and payable; forbearance of money, goods or credits, therefore, refers to arrangements other than loan agreements, where a person acquiesces to the temporary use of his money, goods or credits pending the happening of certain events or fulfilment of certain conditions. (Ignacio, doing business under the name and style Teresa R. Ignacio Enterprises vs. Ragasa, et al., G.R. 227896, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The twelve percent (12 percent ) per annum legal interest shall apply only until June 30, 2013; starting July 1, 2013, the rate of six percent (6 percent ) per annum shall be the prevailing rate of interest when applicable; the need to determine whether the obligation involved herein is a loan and forbearance of money nonetheless exists. (Id.)

#### JUDGES

Compulsory disqualification 
- Section 4, Rule III of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice requires the judge in whose sala an application for notarial commission is filed to conduct a summary hearing to determine whether a petition for notarial commission is sufficient in form and substance; whether the allegations contained in the petition are true; and whether the applicant has read and fully understood the Notarial Rules. (Sindon vs. Presiding Judge Alzate, Regional Trial Court, Branch 1, Bangued, Abra, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2576, Jan. 29, 2020)

Duties 
- Judges, as officers of the court, have the duty to see to it that justice is dispensed with evenly and fairly; not only must they be honest and impartial, but they must also appear to be honest and impartial in the dispensation of justice; judges should make sure that their acts are circumspect and do not arouse suspicion in the minds of the public. (Sindon vs. Presiding Judge Alzate, Regional Trial Court, Branch 1, Bangued, Abra, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2576, Jan. 29, 2020)

Gross ignorance of the law 
- Court finds Judge Villarosa liable for: (1) violation of A.M. No. 03-3-03-SC dated July 8, 2014 when he deliberately failed to transfer eight commercial cases to Branch 137; and (2) four counts of gross ignorance of the law and procedure. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Presiding Judge Villarosa, formerly of Branch 66, Regional Trial Court, Makati City, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2578, Jan. 28, 2020)

#### JUDGMENTS

Execution of 
- Section 36, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court applies to cases where the judgment remains unsatisfied and there is a need for the judgment obligor to appear and be examined concerning his or her property and income to determine whether the same may be properly held to satisfy the full judgment amount; the provision speaks of the judgment obligor's property and income only; not those belonging to third persons; for a judgment creditor or purchaser at an execution sale acquires only whatever rights the judgment obligor may have over the property at the time of levy. (Britania vs. Hon. Gepty in her capacity as Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Valenzuela City, et al., G.R. 246995, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The remedies of a third-party claimant under Section 16 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court is further explained by Justice Florenz D. Regalado in this wise: The remedies of a third-party claimant mentioned in Section 16, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that is, a summary hearing before the court which authorized the execution, or a "terceria" or third-party claim filed with the sheriff, or an action for damages on the bond posted by the judgment creditor, or an independent revindicatory action, are cumulative remedies and may be resorted to by a third-party claimant independently of or separately from and without need of availing of the others. (Sian represented by Romualdo A. Sian vs. Spouses Somoso, the former being substituted by his surviving son, Anthony Voltaire B. Somoso, et al., G.R. 201812, Jan. 22, 2020)

Immutability of 
- As in the liberal construction of the rules on notice of hearing, the Court has enumerated the factors that justify the relaxation of the rule on immutability of final judgments to serve the ends of justice, including: (a) matters of life, liberty, honor or property; (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (c) the merits of the case; (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; and (f) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby. (Latogan vs. People, G.R. 238298, Jan. 22, 2020)


- It is a fundamental principle that a judgment that lapses into finality becomes immutable and unalterable; the primary consequence of this principle is that the judgment may no longer be modified or amended by any court in any manner even if the purpose of the modification or amendment is to correct perceived errors of law or fact; this principle known as the doctrine of immutability of judgment is a matter of sound public policy, which rests upon the practical consideration that every litigation must come to an end. (Britania vs. Hon. Gepty in her capacity as Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Branch 75, Valenzuela City, et al., G.R. 246995, Jan. 22, 2020)

Judgments of quasi-judicial bodies 
- Judgments of courts and quasi-judicial bodies are couched in mandatory language; compliance therewith is compulsory, especially when public interest is at stake; the authority of these rulings, however, is diminished by the flagrant and stubborn refusal of party-litigants to comply with their directives. (Eusebio vs. Civil Service Commission, G.R. 223623, Jan. 29, 2020)

Judgments of trial courts 
- Trial courts should always be mindful of their implicit status in society and the privilege this affords them; with such privilege as their norm, they might unconsciously adopt a standpoint so far removed from the realities of the cases brought before them; in rendering judgment, trial courts must deliberately look beyond their privileged assumptions to resolve the issues set before them with probity and justice. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)

Judicial precedent 
- A judgment in civil case does not rise to a level of a judicial precedent to be followed in subsequent cases by all courts in the land, where the same was rendered by a regional trial court, and not by the Supreme Court; the invalidity of RMC 31-2008 issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), which treats demurrage and detention fees to be within the prism of regular corporate income tax rate, does not preclude the Secretary of Finance from promulgating RR 15-2013, which touches on the same subject, as the CIR and the Secretary of Finance derive their respective powers from two (2) distinct sources; thus, their respective issuances, are separate and independent of each other. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)

Law of the case 
- Law of the case applies only to the same case and relates entirely to questions of law; in law of the case, the rule made by an appellate court cannot be departed from in subsequent proceedings in the same case. (Paterno vs. Paterno, G.R. 213687, Jan. 8, 2020)


- Law of the case has been defined as the opinion delivered on a former appeal; it means that whatever is once irrevocably established, the controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court. (Id.)

#### JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

Power of judicial review 
- A requirement for the exercise of this Court's power of judicial review is that the case must be ripe for adjudication: petitioners must, thus, comply with the requisites for the exercise of the power of judicial review: (1) there must be an actual case or justiciable controversy before this Court; (2) the question before this Court must be ripe for adjudication; (3) the person challenging the act must be a proper party; and (4) the issue of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity and must be the very litis mota of the case. (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)


- An issue is ripe for adjudication when an assailed act has already been accomplished or performed by a branch of government; moreover, the challenged act must have directly adversely affected the party challenging it. (Id.)


- For a case to be considered ripe for adjudication, it is a prerequisite that an act had then been accomplished or performed by either branch of government before a court may interfere, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself as a result of the challenged action. (Id.)


- It is settled that Regional Trial Courts have jurisdiction to resolve the constitutionality of a statute, "this authority being embraced in the general definition of the judicial power to determine what are the valid and binding laws by the criterion of their conformity to the fundamental law"; the Constitution vests the power of judicial review or the power to declare the constitutionality or validity of a law, treaty, international or executive agreement, presidential decree, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation not only in this Court, but in all RTCs. (Id.)


- When matters are still pending or yet to be resolved by some other competent court or body, then those matters are not yet ripe for this Court's adjudication; this is especially true when there are facts that are actively controverted or disputed. (Id.)

#### JURISDICTION

Incapable of pecuniary estimation 
- A demand for the return of the security deposit after the lease agreement had already expired is a collection suit, not an action for specific performance for breach of contract, which is cognizable by the municipal trial court. (Philippine-Japan Active Carbon Corporation vs. Borgaily, G.R. 197022, Jan. 15, 2020)


- In order to determine whether the subject matter of an action is one which is capable of pecuniary estimation, the nature of the principal action or remedy sought must be considered; if it is primarily for recovery of a sum of money, then the claim is considered as capable of pecuniary estimation, and the jurisdiction lies with the municipal trial courts if the amount of the claim does not exceed P300,000.00 outside Metro Manila, and does not exceed P400,000.00 within Metro Manila. (Id.)


- Where the basic issue of the case is something other than the right to recover a sum of money, where the money claim is merely incidental to the principal relief sought, then the subject matter of the action is not capable of pecuniary estimation and is within the jurisdiction of the RTC. (Id.)

Jurisdiction over the subject matter 
- The invariable rule is that what determines the nature of the action, as well as the court has jurisdiction over the case, are the allegations in the complaint; in ejectment cases, the complaint must state and sufficiently show on its face the essential facts laid down under Section 1, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, to give the court jurisdiction without resort to parol evidence. (Madayag vs. Madayag, G.R. 217576, Jan. 20, 2020)


- Under BP Blg. 129, Section 19, RTCs have exclusive jurisdiction "in all other cases in which the demand, exclusive of interest, damages of whatever kind, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs or the value of property in controversy exceeds Three hundred thousand pesos (P300,000.00) or, in such other cases in Metro Manila, where the demand, exclusive of the abovementioned items exceeds Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000.00)." (Llorent vs. Star City PTY Limited, represented by the Jimeno and Cope Law Offices as Attorney-in-fact, G.R. 212050, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### JUSTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES

Defense of relatives 
- The justifying circumstance of defense of a relative likewise requires the firsttwo (2) requisites, but in lieu of the third requirement, it requires that "in case the provocation was given by the person attacked, that the one making the defense had no part therein." (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)

Lack of sufficient provocation 
- In People v. Nabora that a provocation is deemed sufficient if it is "adequate to excite the person to commit the wrong and must accordingly be proportionate to its gravity." (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The third requisite of lack of sufficient provocation requires the person invoking self-defense to not have antagonized the attacker. (Id.)

Reasonable necessity 
- As for the second requisite, "reasonable necessity of means employed to prevent or repel such aggression" envisions a rational equivalence between the perceived danger and the means employed to repel the attack. (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)


- This Court in People v. Encomienda recognized that in circumstances that lead to self-defense or defense of a relative, the instinct for self-preservation will outweigh rational thinking; thus, "when it is apparent that a person has reasonably acted upon this instinct, it is the duty of the courts to sanction the act and hold the act irresponsible in law for the consequences." (Id.)

Self-defense 
- An admission of self-defense or defense of a relative frees the prosecution from the burden of proving that the accused committed the act charged against him or her; the burden is shifted to the accused to prove that his or her act was justified. (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)


- For the justifying circumstance of self-defense to be appreciated in the accused's favor, the accused must prove the following: "(1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person resorting to self-defense." (Id.)

Unlawful aggression 
- In People v. Caratao, this Court emphasized that if unlawful aggression is not proven, "self-defense will not have a leg to stand on and this justifying circumstance cannot and will not be appreciated, even if the other elements are present." (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The first requisite of unlawful aggression is defined as the actual or imminent threat to the person invoking self-defense; this requirement is an indispensable condition of both self-defense and defense of a relative; after all, if there is no unlawful aggression, the assailant would have nothing to prevent or repel. (Id.)

#### KIDNAPPING AND SERIOUS ILLEGAL DETENTION

Elements 
- The crime of Kidnapping and serious illegal detention, under Art. 267 of the RPC, has the following elements: (1) the offender is a private individual; not either of the parents of the victim or a public officer who has a duty under the law to detain a person; (2) he kidnaps or detains another, or in any manner deprives the latter of his liberty; (3) the act of detention or kidnapping must be illegal; and (4) in the commission of the offense, any of the following circumstances is present: (a) the kidnapping or detention lasts for more than three days; (b) it is committed by simulating public authority; (c) any serious physical injuries are inflicted upon the person kidnapped or detained or threats to kill him are made or (d) the person kidnapped or detained is a minor, female or a public official. (People vs. Carreon, G.R. 229086, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The essence of illegal detention is the deprivation of the victim's liberty; the prosecution must prove actual confinement or restriction of the victim, and that such deprivation was the intention of the appellant; the accused must have knowingly acted to restrain the victim; after all, the offense requires taking coupled with intent to restrain; if the victim is a minor, or the victim is kidnapped and illegally detained for the purpose of extorting ransom, the duration of his or her detention becomes inconsequential. (Id.)


- The last paragraph of Article 267 of the RPC provides that if the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the detention or is raped or subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed; the last paragraph gives rise to a special complex crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention with rape. (Id.)


- When it comes to a victim who is a minor, the prevailing jurisprudence on illegal detention is that the curtailment of the victim's liberty need not involve any physical restraint upon the victim's person; leaving a minor in a place from which she or he did not know the way home, even if she or he had the freedom to roam around the place of detention, would still amount to deprivation of liberty. (Id.)

#### LABOR ARBITERS

Jurisdiction 
- Article 224 of the Labor Code clothes the labor tribunals with original and exclusive jurisdiction over claims for damages arising from employer-employee relationship. (Comscentre Phils., Inc., et al. vs. Rocio, G.R. 222212, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from employer-employee relations fall under the original and exclusive jurisdiction of labor arbiters. (Gemudiano, Jr. vs. Naess Shipping Philippines, Inc. and/or Royal Dragon Ocean Transport, Inc. and/or Pedro Miguel F. Oca, G.R. 223825, Jan. 20, 2020)


- In Bañez v. Valdevilla, the Court elucidated that the jurisdiction of labor tribunals is comprehensive enough to include claims for all forms of damages "arising from the employer-employee relations"; thus, the Court decreed therein that labor tribunals have jurisdiction to award not only the reliefs provided by labor laws, but also damages governed by the Civil Code. (Comscentre Phils., Inc., et al. vs. Rocio, G.R. 222212, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In Supra Multi-Services, Inc. v. Labitigan, while we recognized that Article 224 of the Labor Code had been invariably applied to claims for damages filed by an employee against the employer, we held that the law should also apply with equal force to an employer's claim for damages against its dismissed employee, provided that the claim arises from or is necessarily connected with the fact of termination and should be entered as a counterclaim in the illegal dismissal case. (Id.)

#### LABOR RELATIONS

Doctrine of strained relations 
- If reinstatement is not viable, separation pay may be awarded in lieu of reinstatement; considering that Loque no longer asked to be reinstated, the Court takes it as an indicia of strained relations between Loque and Seventh Fleet which makes reinstatement no longer appropriate; thus, the award of backwages and separation pay in lieu of reinstatement is proper in this case; however, a re-computation of the backwages and separation pay is in order considering that backwages and separation pay must be computed until the finality of the decision ordering the payment of separation pay. (Seventh Fleet Security Services, Inc. vs. Loque, G.R. 230005, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In the case of Digital Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. v. Digitel Employees Union, We held that the length of time from the occurrence of the incident to its resolution and the demonstrated litigiousness of the parties showed that their relationship is strained; the protracted litigation between the parties here sufficiently demonstrate that their relationship is strained. (Papertech, Inc vs. Katando, G.R. 236020, Jan. 8, 2020)


- In the case of Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corp. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, wherein We discussed the following considerations in applying the doctrine of strained relations: (1) the employee must occupy a position where he or she enjoys the trust and confidence of his or her employer; (2) it is likely that if reinstated, an atmosphere of antipathy and antagonism may be generated as to adversely affect the efficiency and productivity of the employee concerned; (3) it cannot be applied indiscriminately because some hostility is invariably engendered between the parties as a result of litigation; and (4) it cannot arise from a valid and legal act of asserting one's right; after Globe-Mackay, We clarified that the doctrine cannot apply when the employee has not indicated an aversion to returning to work, or does not occupy a position of trust and confidence in, or has no say in the operation of, the employer's business; in addition, strained relations between the parties must be proven as a fact. (Id.)

Management prerogative 
- There is no question that employers enjoy management prerogative when it comes to the formulation of business policies, including those that affect their employees; however, company policies that are an outcome of an exercise of management prerogative can implicate the rights and obligations of employees, and to that extent they become part of the employment contract, as when the violation of policies is considered a ground for contract termination. Del Monte Fresh Produce (Philippines), Inc. vs. Del Monte Fresh Supervisors Union, G.R. 225115, Jan. 27, 2020)

#### LABOR STANDARDS

Contract of employment between the domestic seafarer and the employer 
- A condition in the employment contract where the commencement of the employment relations is at the discretion or prerogative of the employer's master of the ship through the issuance of a boarding confirmation to the domestic seafarer, is void, as the condition is solely dependent on the will or whim of the employer; when the fulfilment of the condition depends exclusively upon the will of the debtor, the conditional obligation is void. (Gemudiano, Jr. vs. Naess Shipping Philippines, Inc. and/or Royal Dragon Ocean Transport, Inc. and/or Pedro Miguel F. Oca, G.R. 223825, Jan. 20, 2020)


- A purely potestative condition that is imposed not on the birth of the contract of employment because the contract has already been perfected, but only on the fulfillment or performance of the parties' respective obligations, such as for the domestic seafarer to render services on board the ship and for the company to pay him the agreed compensation for such services, is void and must be obliterated from the face of the contract without affecting the rest of the stipulations. (Id.)


- If the court were to make a distinction between the perfection of a contract of employment and the commencement of an employment relationship on its face, and so rule that a mere perfected contract would make the jurisdiction of the case fall under regular courts, the court will arrive at a dangerous conclusion where domestic seafarers' only recourse in law in case of breach of contract is to file a complaint for damages before the regional trial court; in so doing, the domestic seafarers would have to pay filing fees, which their overseas counterpart need not comply with in filing a complaint before the labor arbiters, and the former would need to prove their claim by preponderance of evidence, which is greater than what overseas seafarers need to discharge in cases before labor arbiters, where they only have to prove their claims by substantial evidence. (Id.)


- In the instant case, there is no doubt that there was already a perfected contract of employment between petitioner and respondents; the contract had passed the negotiation stage or "the time the prospective contracting parties manifest their interest in the contract"; it had reached the perfection stage or the so-called "birth of the contract" as it was clearly shown that the essential elements of a contract, i.e., consent, object, and cause, were all present at the time of its constitution. (Id.)


- The determination of propriety of petitioner's non-deployment necessarily involves the interpretation and application of labor laws, which are within the expertise of labor tribunals; the question of whether respondents are justified in cancelling the deployment of petitioner requires determination of whether a subsequent advice from the same medical provider as to the health of petitioner could validly supersede its initial finding during the required PEME that petitioner is fit to work. (Id.)

#### LACHES

Principle of 
- Laches is the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it is present in cases of unreasonable neglect to protect one's rights giving rise to the presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or declined to assert it. (Ang, et al. vs. Abaldonado, G.R. 231913, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### LEASE

Contract of 
- The lessor must return the security deposit to the lessee after the expiration of the lease, but he has the right to withhold the same and to apply it to the damages made on the leased premises by the lessee; a lessee, when it occupies the premises, acknowledges that the leased premises are in good and tenantable condition, and that upon termination of the lease, it will surrender the premises, also in the same good and tenantable condition when taken, with the exception of ordinary wear and tear. (Philippine-Japan Active Carbon Corporation vs. Borgaily, G.R. 197022, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 (R.A. 7160)

Business tax 
- Respondent, being one of the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) holding companies whose public assets are owned by the Republic of the Philippines, is not liable to pay local business tax on the dividends earned from its San Miguel Corporation (SMC) preferred shares. (City of Davao, et al. vs. AP Holdings, Inc., G.R. 245887, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNIT (LGU)

Territorial jurisdiction 
- A local government unit is created by law, with due regard to "verifiable indicators of viability and projected capacity to provide services"; by correlating territorial jurisdiction with territorial boundaries in its December 4, 2018 Decision, this Court placed too much reliance on land area as indicative of the metes and bounds of a local government unit; the Local Government Code defines "land area" as: (c) Land Area. - It must be contiguous, unless it comprises two (2) or more islands or is separated by a local government unit independent of the others; properly identified by metes and bounds with technical descriptions; and sufficient to provide for such basic services and facilities to meet the requirements of its populace. (Republic of the Philippines, Represented by Raphael P.M. Lotilla, Secretary, Department of Energy (DOE) vs. Provincial Government of Palawan, Represented by Governor Abraham Kahlil B. Mitra, G.R. 170867, Jan. 21, 2020) 


- Article X, Section 7 of the Constitution mandates that local government units shall be entitled to an equitable share in the utilization and development of the natural wealth within their area; while "territorial jurisdiction" does not appear in the Constitution, it is inscribed in the Local Government Code, the law meant to implement the constitutional mandate under Article X, Section 7; the Local Government Code provides that local government units shall be entitled to a 40 percent  share in the gross collection the State derives from the utilization and development of these natural resources "within their territorial jurisdiction." (Id.)


- Presidential Decree No. 1596 categorically states that the seabed, subsoil, and continental margin shall be included in the Municipality of Kalayaan and made part of the Province of Palawan; this means that the territory and thus, the territorial jurisdiction of the Province of Palawan extends to the entirety of the Municipality of Kalayaan, including its seabed, subsoil, and the continental margin; this interpretation is more consistent with the factual findings of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in its landmark ruling, which used the Province of Palawan as its baseline point to determine the contested reefs' proximity to the Philippines. (Id.)


- Since the Local Government Code requires that the land area "must be contiguous," this Court emphasized in its Decision that contiguity is essential in determining territorial jurisdiction; however, the phrase "must be contiguous" is followed by an important proviso: "unless it comprises two or more islands"; thus, it is clear from the laws and regulations defining a local government unit's "respective area" that the requirement of contiguity shall not apply if the local government unit is comprised of islands; all that is required is that it is properly identified by its metes and bounds; this clarification is necessary considering the geographical peculiarities unique to the Province of Palawan. (Id.)


- The Constitution assigns the natural boundaries of local government units as either "territorial and political subdivisions" or "autonomous regions"; territorial and political subdivisions are the provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays, and are covered by the entirety of Article X of the Constitution; autonomous regions are covered by a different set of constitutional provisions; their territorial jurisdiction, therefore, is not defined akin to that of territorial and political subdivisions. (Id.)


- The Constitution does not define a local government unit's territorial jurisdiction in relation to its entitlement to an equitable share in the utilization and development of the natural wealth; it does, however, mandate that the shares shall be within their respective areas and in the manner provided by law. (Id.)


- The province of Palawan need not return the funds it received under Executive Order No. 683, for to require the return of funds not only undermines public welfare and the presumption of regularity of the actions of public officials, but will likewise weaken the local autonomy envisioned by the constitution. (Id.)

#### MARRIAGE

Declaration of presumptive death 
- Mere absence of the spouse (even for such period required by the law), lack of any news that such absentee is still alive, failure to communicate or general presumption of absence under the Civil Code would not suffice; this conclusion proceeds from the premise that Article 41 of the Family Code places upon the present spouse the burden of proving the additional and more stringent requirement of "well-founded belief'' which can only be discharged upon a showing of proper and honest-to-goodness inquiries and efforts to ascertain not only the absent spouse's whereabouts but, more importantly, that the absent spouse is still alive or is already dead. (Republic vs. Quiñonez, G.R. 237412, Jan. 6, 2020)


- The Court en banc clarified the meaning of well-founded belief by comparing the language of Article 41 to its Civil Code counterpart; the Court held: Notably, Article 41 of the Family Code, compared to the old provision of the Civil Code which it superseded, imposes a stricter standard; it requires a "well-founded belief" that the absentee is already dead before a petition for declaration of presumptive death can be granted. (Id.)


- The essential requisites for a declaration of presumptive death for the purpose of remarriage are: 1. That the absent spouse has been missing for four consecutive years, or two consecutive years if the disappearance occurred where there is danger of death under the circumstances laid down in Article 391, Civil Code; 2. That the present spouse wishes to remarry; 3. That the present spouse has a well-founded belief that the absentee is dead; and 4. That the present spouse files a summary proceeding for the declaration of presumptive death of the absentee. (Id.)


- To be able to comply with this requirement, the present spouse must prove that his/her belief was the result of diligent and reasonable efforts and inquiries to locate the absent spouse and that based on these efforts and inquiries, he/she believes that under the circumstances, the absent spouse is already dead; it requires exertion of active effort (not a mere passive one). (Id.)

#### MIGRANT WORKERS AND OVERSEAS FILIPINOS ACT OF 1995 (R.A. 8042)

Application of 
- Republic Act No. (RA) 8042, otherwise known as the Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos Act of 1995, explicitly prohibits the substitution or alteration to the prejudice of the worker of employment contracts already approved and verified by the DOLE from the time of actual signing thereof by the parties up to and including the period of the expiration of the same without the approval of the DOLE. (Prime Stars International Promotion Corporation, et al. vs. Baybayan, et al., G.R. 213961, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Section 10 of RA 8042 mandates solidary liability among the corporate officers, directors, partners and the corporation or partnership for any claims and damages that may be due to the overseas workers. (Id.)

#### MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

Filing of 
- Filing of the motion beyond the prescribed fifteen (15)–day period forecloses the right to appeal; that the belated filing was due to the negligence of the counsel's secretary cannot justify the lenient application or suspension of the rules. (Spouses Yap-Sumndad, et al. vs. Friday's Holdings, Inc., represented herein by its Director Mario B. Badiola, G.R. 235586, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### MURDER

Commission of 
- Every conviction requires that the prosecution prove: (1) the identity of the accused; and (2) the fact of the crime; the second requirement is fulfilled when all the elements of the crime charged are present. (People vs. Pitulan, G.R. 226486, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In De Guzman, this Court discussed that paraffin testing is conclusive only as to the presence of nitrate particles in a person, but not as to its source, such as from firing a gun; by itself, paraffin testing only indicates a possibility, not infallibility, that a person has fired a gun. (Id.)


- In People v. Tuniaco, this Court held that the presentation of the murder weapon is not indispensable to prove the corpus delicti, as its physical existence is not an element of murder; to prove the corpus delicti, the prosecution only needs to show that: "(a) a certain result has been established and (b) some person is criminally responsible for it." (Id.)

#### 2000 NATIONAL PROSECUTION SERVICE (NPS)

Rule on appeals 
- Based on the [DOJ's Department Circular No. 70-A and Department Circular No. 018-14], it can be deduced that the prevailing appeals process in the NPS with regard to complaints subject of preliminary investigation would depend on two (2) factors, namely: (1) where the complaint was filed, i.e., whether in the NCR or in the provinces; and (2) which court has original jurisdiction over the case, i.e., whether or not it is cognizable by the MTCs/MeTCs/MCTCs. (Urmaza, vs. Hon. Regional Prosecutor Rojas/Hon. Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Ulanday, et al., G.R. 240012, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In Cariaga v. Sapigao, the Court summarized the rule as follows: (a) If the complaint is filed outside the NCR and is cognizable by the MTCs/MeTCs/MCTCs, the ruling of the OPP may be appealable by way of petition for review before the ORP, which ruling shall be with finality; (b) If the complaint is filed outside the NCR and is not cognizable by the MTCs/MeTCs/MCTCs, the ruling of the OPP may be appealable by way of petition for review before the SOJ, which ruling shall be with finality; (c) If the complaint is filed within the NCR and is cognizable by the MTCs/MeTCs/MCTCs, the ruling of the Office of the City Prosecutor (OCP) may be appealable by way of petition for review before the Prosecutor General, whose ruling shall be with finality; (d) If the complaint is filed within the NCR and is not cognizable by the MTCs/MeTCs/MCTCs, the ruling of the OCP may be appealable by way of petition for review before the SOJ, whose ruling shall be with finality; (e) Provided, that in instances covered by (a) and (c), the SOJ may, pursuant to his power of control and supervision over the entire NPS, review, modify, or reverse the ruling of the ORP or the Prosecutor General, as the case may be. (Id.)


- While the Court of Appeals could have taken cognizance of the case since the ruling of the Office of Regional Prosecutor (ORP) with regard to herein petitioner's appeal should be deemed final, the CA cannot be faulted for dismissing her petition outright as there was no way for the CA to determine whether or not said petition was filed on time. (Id.)

#### NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS LAW (ACT NO. 2031)

Liability of drawer 
- Generally, by drawing a check, the drawer: admits the existence of the payee and his then capacity to endorse; impliedly represents that he (the payee) has funds or credits available for its payment in the bank in which it is drawn; engages that if the bill is not paid by the drawee and due proceedings on dishonour are taken by the holder, he will upon demand pay the amount of the bill together with the damages and expenses accruing to the holder by reason of the dishonor of the instrument; and, if the drawee refuses to accept a bill drawn upon him, becomes liable to pay the instrument according to his original undertaking. (Llorent vs. Star City PTY Limited, represented by the Jimeno and Cope Law Offices as Attorney-in-fact, G.R. 212050, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Its secondary liability under Section 61 of the NIL became primary when the payment of the subject demand/bank drafts had been stopped which had the same effect as if the instruments had been dishonored and notice thereof was given to the drawer pursuant to Section 84 of the NIL. (Id.)


- Regarding the effect of countermand or stopping payment, the drawer of a bill, including a draft or check, as a general rule, may by notice to the drawee prior to acceptance or payment countermand his order and command the drawee not to pay, in which case the drawee is obliged to refuse to accept or pay; there are however cases which hold that a draft drawn by one bank upon another and bought and paid for by a remitter, as the equivalent of money or as an executed sale of credit by the drawer, is not subject to rescission or countermand so as to avoid the drawer's liability thereon. (Id.)


- The liability of the drawer is not primary but secondary, particularly after acceptance because it is conditional upon proper presentment and notice of dishonor, and, in case of a foreign bill of exchange, protest, unless such conditions are excused or dispensed with; under Section 84 of the NIL, when the instrument is dishonored by non-payment, an immediate right of recourse to all parties secondarily liable thereon accrues to the holder, subject to the provisions of the NIL. (Id.)


- The right to stop payment cannot be exercised so as to prejudice the rights of holders in due course without rendering the drawer liable on the instrument to such holders; stopping payment does not discharge the liability of the drawer of a check or other bill to the payee or other holder; where payment has been stopped by the drawer the relation between the drawer and payee becomes the same as if the instrument had been dishonored and notice thereof given to the drawer; the drawer's conditional liability is changed to one free from the condition and his situation is like that of the maker of a promissory note due on demand; and he is liable on the instrument if he has no sufficient defense. (Id.)


- When the bank, as the drawer of a negotiable check, signs the instrument its engagement is then as absolute and express as if it were written on the check and a dual promise is implied from the issuance of a check: first, that the bank upon which it is drawn will pay the amount thereof; and second, if such bank should fail to make the payment, the drawer will pay the same to the holder. (Id.)

#### NOTARIES PUBLIC

Effect of notarization 
- For notarization ensures the authenticity and reliability of a document; it converts a private document into a public one and makes it admissible in evidence without need of preliminary proof of authenticity and due execution. (Ladrera vs. Atty. Osorio, A.C. No. 10315, Jan. 22, 2020)

Jurat and acknowledgment 
- The language of the jurat avows that the document was subscribed and sworn to before the notary public; on the other hand, an acknowledgment is the act of one who has executed a deed, attesting the deed to be his own before some competent officer; the notary declares that the executor of the document has personally attested before him or her the same to be the executor's free act. (Ladrera vs. Atty. Osorio, A.C. No. 10315, Jan. 22, 2020)

Liability of 
- Atty. Osorio's want of care in the performance of his notarial duties constituted a transgression of Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which requires lawyers to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land, and promote respect for the law and legal processes, and of the Lawyer's Oath which commands him to obey the laws and to do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in court. (Ladrera vs. Atty. Osorio, A.C. No. 10315, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The required personal appearance and competent evidence of identity allow the notary public to verify the identity of the principal himself or herself and determine whether the instrument, deed, or document is his or her voluntary act; competent evidence of identity is necessary for filling in the details of the notarial register. (Id.)

#### OBLIGATIONS AND CONTRACTS

Forbearance of money 
- The difference between the final amount as adjudged by the court and the initial payment made by the government should earn legal interest; accrual of legal interest should begin from the issuance of the writ of possession since it is from this date that the fact of deprivation of property can be established. (National Power Corporation vs. Heirs of Salvador Serra Serra, et al., G.R. 224324, Jan. 22, 2020)

Judicial consignation 
- The requirements of judicial consignation, viz.: (1) a debt due; (2) the creditor to whom tender of payment was made refused without just cause to accept the payment, or the creditor was absent, unknown or incapacitated, or several persons claimed the same right to collect, or the title of the obligation was lost; (3) the person interested in the performance of the obligation was given notice before consignation was made; (4) the amount was placed at the disposal of the court; and (5) the person interested in the performance of the obligation was given notice after the consignation was made. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)

Solidary liability 
- According to Article 1207 of the Civil Code, there is solidary liability only when the obligation expressly so states, or when the law or the nature of the obligation requires solidarity. (Llorent vs. Star City PTY Limited, represented by the Jimeno and Cope Law Offices a Attorney-in-fact, G.R. 212050, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### OMBUDSMAN ACT OF 1989 (R.A. 6770)

Office of the Special Prosecutor 
- In Dumangcas, Jr. v. Marcelo, this Court held that even a one-line marginal note by the Ombudsman is sufficient to approve or disapprove the Office of the Special Prosecutor's recommendations: it may appear that the Ombudsman's one-line note lacks any factual or evidentiary grounds as it did not set forth the same; the state of affairs, however, is that the Ombudsman's note stems from his or her review of the findings of fact reached by the investigating prosecutor. (Beltran, et al. vs. Sandiganbayan (Second Division), et al., G.R. 201117, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In its current form, the Office of the Special Prosecutor is a component of the Office of the Ombudsman, with both concurrently exercising prosecutorial powers; however, in exercising its functions, the Office of the Special Prosecutor shall be under the supervision and control of the Office of the Ombudsman and can only act upon its authority; the Office of the Special Prosecutor is but a mere component of the Office of the Ombudsman; it does not possess an independent power to act on behalf of the Ombudsman. (Id.)

#### ORAL DEFAMATION OR SLANDER

Commission of 
- Oral defamation may either be simple or grave; it becomes grave when it is of a serious and insulting nature; an allegation is considered defamatory if it ascribes to a person the commission of a crime, the possession of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance which tends to dishonor or discredit or put him in contempt or which tends to blacken the memory of one who is dead. (Urmaza, vs. Hon. Regional Prosecutor Rojas/Hon. Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Ulanday, et al., G.R. 240012, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Oral Defamation or Slander is libel committed by oral means, instead of in writing; it is defined as "the speaking of base and defamatory words which tend to prejudice another in his reputation, office, trade, business or means of livelihood." (Id.)


- The elements of Oral Defamation are: (1) there must be an imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, status or circumstances; (2) made orally; (3) publicly; (4) and maliciously; (5) directed to a natural or juridical person, or one who is dead; (6) which tends to cause dishonor, discredit or contempt of the person defamed. (Id.)

#### PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION-STANDARD EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT (POEA-SEC)

Compensability of disability 
- As to the extent of compensability, the entitlement of an overseas seafarer to disability benefits is governed by the law, the employment contract, and the medical findings in accordance with the rules. (Wilhelmsen Smith Bell Manning, Inc., et al. vs. Villaflor, G.R. 225425, Jan. 29, 2020)


- For disability to be compensable under Section 20(A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, the two elements must concur: (1) the injury or illness must be work-related; and (2) the work-related injury or illness must have existed during the term of the seafarer's contract. (Id.)


- Regarding the company-designated physician's duty to issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading to determine the extent of compensation: 1. The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him; 2. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total; 3. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days; the employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and 4. If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification. (Id.)

Compensation and benefits for injury or illness 
- Non-compliance with the third doctor referral does not automatically make the diagnosis of the company-designated physician conclusive and binding on the courts; the Court has previously held that, "if the findings of the company-designated physician are clearly biased in favor of the employer, then courts may give greater weight to the findings of the seafarer's personal physician." (Multinational Ship Management, Inc./Singa Ship Agencies, Pte. Ltd., et al. vs. Briones, G.R. 239793, Jan. 27, 2020)


- We also ruled in Kestrel Shipping Co., Inc., et al., v. Munar, that "a seafarer's compliance with such procedure presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with an assessment as to his fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration of the 120-day or 240-day periods; absent a certification from the company-designated physician, the seafarer had nothing to contest and the law steps in to conclusively characterize his disability as total and permanent." (Id.)


- Under Section 20(A)(3) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, "if a doctor appointed by the seafarer disagrees with the assessment, a third doctor may be agreed jointly between the Employer and the seafarer; the third doctor's decision shall be final and binding on both parties"; the provision refers to the declaration of fitness to work or the degree of disability; it presupposes that the company-designated physician came up with a valid, final and definite assessment as to the seafarer's fitness or unfitness to work before the expiration of the 120-day or 240-day period. (Id.)

Total and permanent disability 
- A total disability does not require that the employee be completely disabled, or totally paralyzed; what is necessary is that the injury must be such that the employee cannot pursue his or her usual work and earn from it; on the other hand, a total disability is considered permanent if it lasts continuously for more than 120 days; what is crucial is whether the employee who suffers from disability could still perform his work notwithstanding the disability he incurred. (Multinational Ship Management, Inc./Singa Ship Agencies, Pte. Ltd., et al. vs. Briones, G.R. 239793, Jan. 27, 2020)

Work-related injury 
- It is not necessary that the nature of the employment be the sole and only reason for the illness or injury suffered by the seafarer; it is sufficient that there is a reasonable linkage between the disease suffered by the employee and his work to lead a rational mind to conclude that his work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing condition he might have had. (Wilhelmsen Smith Bell Manning, Inc., et al. vs. Villaflor, G.R. 225425, Jan. 29, 2020)


- One "arising out of and in the course of employment"; jurisprudence is to the effect that compensable illness or injury cannot be confined to the strict interpretation of said provision in the POEA-SEC as even pre-existing conditions may be compensable if aggravated by the seafarer's working condition. (Id.)

#### PLEADINGS

Filing and service 
- Even if a party represented by counsel has been actually notified, said notice is not considered notice in law; the reason is simple, the parties, generally, have no formal education or knowledge of the rules of procedure, specifically, the mechanics of an appeal or availment of legal remedies; thus, they may also be unaware of the rights and duties of a litigant relative to the receipt of a decision. (Calleon vs. HZSC Realty Corporation, G.R. 228572, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Section 2, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court provides that "if any party has appeared by counsel, service upon him shall be made upon his counsel or one of them, unless service upon the party himself is ordered by the court." (Id.)

#### PRESUMPTIONS

Presumption of innocence 
- Before the accused in a criminal case may be convicted, the evidence must be strong enough to overcome the presumption of innocence and to exclude every hypothesis except that of the guilt of the defendant; if the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, then the evidence does not pass the test of moral certainty and will not suffice to support a conviction. (People vs. Dolandolan, G.R. 232157, Jan. 8, 2020)


- The constitutional presumption of innocence is not violated when there is a logical connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed; when such prima facie evidence is unexplained or not contradicted by the accused, the conviction founded on such evidence will be valid; however, the prosecution must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt; the existence of a disputable presumption does not preclude the presentation of contrary evidence. (Fuertes vs. Senate of the Philippines, et al., G.R. 208162, Jan. 7, 2020)


- The Court, in People v. Lagramada, explained: in a criminal prosecution, the law always presumes that the defendant is not guilty of any crime whatsoever, and this presumption stands until it is overcome by competent and credible proof; where two conflicting probabilities arise from the evidence, the one compatible with the presumption of innocence will be adopted; it is therefore incumbent upon the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused with moral certainty or beyond reasonable doubt as demanded by law. (People vs. Dolandolan, G.R. 232157, Jan. 8, 2020)

Presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties 
- Given the flagrant procedural lapses the police committed in handling the seized shabu and the obvious evidentiary gaps in the chain of its custody, a presumption of regularity in the performance of duties cannot be made in this case; a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is made in the context of an existing rule of law or statute authorizing the performance of an act or duty or prescribing a procedure in the performance thereof. (People vs. Sebilleno, G.R. 221457, Jan. 13, 2020)


- In People v. Kamad, this Court explained: given the flagrant procedural lapses the police committed in handling the seized shabu and the obvious evidentiary gaps in the chain of its custody, a presumption of regularity in the performance of duties cannot be made in this case; a presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty is made in the context of an existing rule of law or statute authorizing the performance of an act or duty or prescribing a procedure in the performance thereof. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Judicial reliance on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity; the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty cannot overcome the stronger presumption of innocence in favor of the accused; otherwise, a mere rule of evidence will defeat the constitutionally enshrined right to be presumed innocent. (Edangalino vs. People, G.R. 235110, Jan. 8, 2020)


- The presumption applies when nothing in the record suggests that the law enforcers deviated from the standard conduct of official duty required by law; where the official act is irregular on its face, the presumption cannot arise. (Quillao vs. People, G.R. 239772, Jan. 29, 2020) (People vs. Sebilleno, G.R. 221457, Jan. 13, 2020)


- This presumption is neither definite nor conclusive; it cannot overturn the constitutionally safeguarded presumption of innocence; when the assailed official act is irregular on its face, as in this case, an adverse presumption arises as a matter of course. (People vs. Suating alias "Bok", G.R. 220142, Jan. 29, 2020)

Presumption of regularity of a notarized document 
- The presumption of regularity accorded to notarized documents is not conclusive as it can be refuted by clear and convincing evidence. (Odrada vs. Lazaro, et al., G.R. 205515, Jan. 20, 2020)

#### PUBLIC OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

Condonation doctrine 
- In Crebello v. Ombudsman, it was underscored that the prospective application of Carpio-Morales should be reckoned from April 12, 2016 because that was the date on which this Court had acted upon and denied with finality the motion for clarification/motion for partial reconsideration thereon. (Herrera vs. Mago, et al., G.R. 231120, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The condonation doctrine had been considered as good law since then until November 10, 2015 when the Court promulgated Carpio-Morales v. Court of Appeals, thus: relatedly it should be clarified that there is no truth in Pascual's postulation that the courts would be depriving the electorate of their right to elect their officers if condonation were not to be sanctioned; in political law, election pertains to the process by which a particular constituency chooses an individual to hold a public office; in this jurisdiction, there is, again, no legal basis to conclude that election automatically implies condonation. (Id.)

Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service 
- In Pia v. Gervacio, Jr., it was explained that "acts may constitute Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service as long as they tarnish the image and integrity of his/her public office." (Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao vs. Llauder, G.R. 219062, Jan. 29, 2020)

Discretionary functions 
- Discretion, when applied to public functionaries, means a power or right conferred upon them by law of acting officially, under certain circumstances, according to the dictates of their own judgments and consciences, uncontrolled by the judgments or consciences of others. (Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao vs. Llauder, G.R. 219062, Jan. 29, 2020)

Discretionary functions distinguished from ministerial functions 
- A purely ministerial act or duty, in contradistinction to a discretional act, is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of his own judgment, upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done. (Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao vs. Llauder, G.R. 219062, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Although respondent's function as an assistant registration officer is indeed ministerial, this does not mean that she must blindly approve all applications submitted to her office; it is ministerial in that when a properly accomplished application is presented before her accompanied by all the necessary documents, she has no choice but to approve and process the registration. (Id.)


- If the law imposes a duty upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is discretionary and not ministerial; the duty is ministerial only when the discharge of the same requires neither the exercise of official discretion nor judgment. (Id.)

Grave misconduct 
- Defined as the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer coupled with the elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules. (Herrera vs. Mago, et al., G.R. 231120, Jan. 15, 2020)

Gross neglect of duty 
- Gross neglect of duty is understood as the failure to give proper attention to a required task or to discharge a duty, characterized by want of even the slightest care, or by conscious indifference to the consequences insofar as other persons may be affected, or by flagrant and palpable breach of duty; it is the omission of that care which even inattentive and thoughtless men never fail to give to their own property. (Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao vs. Llauder, G.R. 219062, Jan. 29, 2020)

Liability of 
- Under Section 50 of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, if the respondent is found guilty of two (2) or more charges, the penalty for the most serious charge shall be imposed and the other charges shall be considered as aggravating circumstances; under Section 49 of the same Rules, the maximum of the penalty shall be imposed where only aggravating and no mitigating circumstances are present; grave misconduct is classified as a grave offense for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even for first time offenders; on the other hand, conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service is a grave offense, which carries the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and the penalty of dismissal for the second offense. (Herrera vs. Mago, et al., G.R. 231120, Jan. 15, 2020)

Simple dishonesty 
- As an administrative offense, dishonesty is defined as the concealment or distortion of truth in a matter of fact relevant to one's office or connected with the performance of his duties; it is disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray. (Soliva vs. Dr. Tanggol, in his capacity as Chancellor of Mindanao State University - Iligan Institute of Technology (MSU-IIT), G.R. 223429, Jan. 29, 2020)

Simple neglect of duty 
- It is characterized by failure of an employee or official to give proper attention to a task expected of him or her, signifying a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference; this warrants the penalty of mere suspension from office without pay. (Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao vs. Llauder, G.R. 219062, Jan. 29, 2020)


- Simple neglect of duty means the failure of an employee or official to give proper attention to a task expected of him or her, signifying a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference. (Ancheta vs. Villa, G.R. 229634, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES

Treachery 
- Defined as "the swift and unexpected attack on the unarmed victim without the slightest provocation on his or her part"; to substantiate its allegation of treachery, the prosecution must prove: "(1) that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself, and (2) that the offender consciously adopted the particular means, method or form of attack employed by him." (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)

#### RAPE

Commission of 
- Rape is committed: 1. By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: a. Through force, threat or intimidation; b. When the offended party is deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious; c. By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; d. When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present; the elements necessary to sustain a conviction for statutory rape are: (1) the offender is a man; (2) he had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (3) the offended party is under 12 years old. (People vs. Gratela, G.R. 225961, Jan. 6, 2020)


- The elements of rape by carnal knowledge under Article 266-A (1)(a) are: (1) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (2) such act was accomplished through force, threat, or intimidation. ) (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230904, Jan. 8, 2020)


- When the offender is the victim's father, there need not be actual force, threat or intimidation because when a father commits the odious crime of rape against his own daughter who was a minor at the time the crime was committed, his moral ascendancy or influence over the latter substitutes for violence and intimidation.) (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230904, Jan. 8, 2020)

Sexual abuse of minors 
- The Court herein observes that R.A. 8353 amending the RPC should now be uniformly applied in cases involving sexual intercourse committed against minors, and not Section 5 (b) of R.A. 7610; while R.A. 7610 has been considered as a special law that covers the sexual abuse of minors, R.A. 8353 has expanded the reach of our already existing rape laws; these existing rape laws should not only pertain to the old Article 335 of the RPC but also to the provision on sexual intercourse under Section 5 (b) of R.A. 7610 which, applying Quimvel's characterization of a child "exploited in prostitution or subjected to other abuse," virtually punishes the rape of a minor. (People vs. Gratela, G.R. 225961, Jan. 6, 2020)

#### RES JUDICATA

Bar by prior judgment 
- Res judicata applies in the concept of "bar by prior judgment" if the following requisites concur: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) the judgment or order must be on the merits; (3) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and (4) there must be, between the first and the second action, identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)

Principle of 
- A prior decision is conclusive in a second suit where the elements of res judicata are present; for a prior judgment to constitute a bar to a subsequent case, the following requisites must concur: a. it must be a final judgment or order; b. the court rendering the same must have jurisdiction over the subject matter and over parties; c. there must be between the two cases identity of parties, identity of subject matter and identity of causes of action; and d. it must be a judgment or order on the merits. (Id.)


- Although there is identity of parties and identity of issues raised in both cases, the prior decision does not constitute a judgment on the merits which would operate to bar the resolution of the substantive issues in a subsequent case, where the same was premised primarily on lack of jurisdiction. (Golez, in his own behalf and his children Crispino Golez, et al. vs. Abais, G.R. 191376, Jan. 8, 2020)

#### REVISED CORPORATION CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES (R.A. 11232)

Isolated transaction rule 
- The issue on whether a foreign corporation which does not have license to engage in business in the Philippines can seek redress in Philippine courts depends on whether it is doing business or it merely entered into an isolated transaction; a foreign corporation that is not doing business in the Philippines must disclose such fact if it desires to sue in Philippine courts under the "isolated transaction rule" because without such disclosure, the court may choose to deny it the right to sue. (Llorent vs. Star City PTY Limited, represented by the Jimeno, G.R. 212050, Jan. 15, 2020)


- The right and capacity to sue, being, to a great extent, matters of pleading and procedure, depend upon the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint; as to a foreign corporation, the qualifying circumstance that if it is doing business in the Philippines, it is duly licensed or if it is not, it is suing upon a singular and isolated transaction, is an essential element of the plaintiff's capacity to sue and must be affirmatively pleaded. (Id.)


- While the law (presently the Revised Corporation Code or its predecessor, the Corporation Code) grants to foreign corporations with Philippine license the right to sue in the Philippines, the Court, however, in a long line of cases under the regime of the Corporation Code has held that a foreign corporation not engaged in business in the Philippines may not be denied the right to file an action in the Philippine courts for an isolated transaction. (Id.)

#### REVISED RULES OF ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE (RRACCS)

Application of 
- Section 46, Rule 10 of the Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS) classifies grave misconduct and gross neglect of duty as grave offenses punishable by dismissal from the service even on the first violation; Section 52(a) of the RRACCS states that the penalty of dismissal shall carry with it the cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification from holding public office and bar from taking civil service examinations. (Sarno-Davin, Presiding Judge, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19 vs. Quirante, Clerk III, Regional Trial Court, Digos, Davao del Sur, Branch 19, A.M. No. P-19-4021, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### ROBBERY WITH RAPE

Commission of 
- For the crime of robbery with rape, the law does not distinguish whether the rape was committed before, during, or after the robbery, but only that it punishes robbery that was accompanied by rape. (People vs. Salen, Jr., G.R. 231013, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The elements of robbery with rape are the following: (1) the taking of personal property is committed with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is characterized by intent to gain or animus lucrandi; and (4) the robbery is accompanied by rape; here, the prosecution has sufficiently showed that the elements of the crime are present. (Id.)

#### SALES

Brokerage service 
- When there is a close, proximate, and causal connection between the broker's efforts and the principal's sale of his property or joint venture agreement, in this case the broker is entitled to a commission. (Ignacio, doing business under the name and style Teresa R. Ignacio Enterprises vs. Ragasa, et al., G.R. 227896, Jan. 29, 2020)

Double sale 
- Although it is a recognized principle that a person dealing on a registered land need not go beyond its certificate of title, it is also a firmly settled rule that where there are circumstances which would put a party on guard and prompt him to investigate or inspect the property being sold to him, such as the presence of occupants/tenants thereon, it is expected from the purchaser of a valued piece of land to inquire first into the status or nature of possession of the occupants. (Spouses German vs. Spouses Santuyo, et al., G.R. 210845, Jan. 22, 2020)


- For Article 1544 to apply, the following requisites must concur: this provision connotes that the following circumstances must concur: "(a) the two or more sales transactions in the issue must pertain to exactly the same subject matter, and must be valid sales transactions; (b) the two or more buyers at odds over the rightful ownership of the subject matter must each represent conflicting interests; and (c) the two or more buyers at odds over the rightful ownership of the subject matter must each have bought from the very same seller." (Id.)


- Generally, persons dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title, without having to go beyond it to determine the property's condition; however, when circumstances are present that should prompt a potential buyer to be on guard, it is expected that they inquire first into the status of the land; one such circumstance is when there are occupants or tenants on the property, or when the seller is not in possession of it. (Id.)


- It is readily apparent that the rules concerning double sale of movable properties differ from that of immovable properties; in double sale of immovable sale, the law provides for a three-pronged approach in determining ownership, to wit: (1) to the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of Property; (2) in default thereof, to the person who in good faith was first in possession; and (3) in default thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good faith; on the other hand, in case of double sale of a movable property, ownership is simply transferred to the first who may have taken possession thereof in good faith. (Odrada vs. Lazaro, et al., G.R. 205515, Jan. 20, 2020)


- Ownership over the motor vehicle rightfully belongs to the first possessor in good faith. (Id.)


- Pursuant to Article 1544, ownership of immovable property subject of a double sale is transferred to the buyer who first registers it in the Registry of Property in good faith. (Spouses German vs. Spouses Santuyo, et al., G.R. 210845, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The rule on double sales applies when the same thing is sold to multiple buyers by one seller, but not to sales of the same thing by multiple sellers. (Id.)


- The second buyer who has actual or constructive knowledge of the prior sale cannot be a registrant in good faith; thus, he cannot rely on the indefeasibility of his transfer certificate of title. (Id.)

#### SEARCHES AND SEIZURES

Probable cause 
- Since probable cause is dependent largely on the findings of the judge who conducted the examination and who had the opportunity to question the applicant and his witnesses, then his findings deserve great weight; the reviewing court can overturn such findings only upon proof that the judge disregarded the facts before him or ignored the clear dictates of reason. (People vs. Gabiosa, Sr., G.R. 248395, Jan. 29, 2020)


- The purpose of the proceeding is for the judge to determine that probable cause exists; there is no need to examine both the applicant and the witness/es if either one of them is sufficient to establish probable cause. (Id.)

Search warrant 
- Warrant that justifies the intrusion, to be valid, must satisfy the following requirements: (1) it must be issued upon "probable cause;" (2) probable cause must be determined personally by the judge; (3) such judge must examine under oath or affirmation the complainant and the witnesses he may produce; and (4) the warrant must particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. (People vs. Gabiosa, Sr., G.R. 248395, Jan. 29, 2020)

Validity of 
- Despite the sanctity that the Constitution accords a person's abode, however, it still recognizes that there may be circumstances when State-sanctioned intrusion to someone's home may be justified, and as a consequence, also reasonable; this is also why the right only protects the individual against unreasonable searches or seizures because while State-sanctioned intrusion is, as a general rule, unreasonable, the Constitution itself lays down the main exception on when it becomes reasonable: when the State obtains a warrant from a judge who issues the same on the basis of probable cause. (People vs. Gabiosa, Sr., G.R. 248395, Jan. 29, 2020)


- It preserves, in essence, the right of the people "to be let alone" vis-à-vis the far-reaching and encompassing powers of the State, with respect to their persons, houses, papers, and effects; it thus ensures protection of the individual from arbitrary searches and arrests initiated and perpetrated by the State. (Id.)

#### SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE

Extrajudicial settlement of estate 
- An unregistered affidavit of self-adjudication or extrajudicial settlement does not bind third persons with respect to the adjudication of property but there is no rule that the same cannot be used to prove that one is an heir due to the sheer fact that it was not registered before the register of deeds. (Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Macabagdal, represented by Eulogia Macabagdal-Pascual, G.R. 203948, Jan. 22, 2020)

#### SPECIAL PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AGAINST ABUSE, EXPLOITATION AND DISCRIMINATION ACT (R.A. 7610)

Application of 
- Debasement is defined as "the act of reducing the value, quality, or purity of something"; degradation, on the other hand, means the "lessening of a person's or thing's character or quality"; intent is a state of mind that accompanies the act; since intent is an internal state, the same can only be verified through the external acts of the person. (Delos Santos vs. People, G.R. 227581, Jan. 15, 2020)

Lascivious conduct 
- The elements of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of RA 7610 are as follows: (1) The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse; "children exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse" those children, whether male or female, (1) who for money, profit or any other consideration or (2) due to the coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (3) The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230904, Jan. 8, 2020)

#### STATUTES

Contemporaneous construction 
- Contemporaneous construction is resorted to when there is an ambiguity in the law and its provisions cannot be discerned through plain meaning; the interpretation of those called upon to implement the law is given great respect. (Republic of the Philippines, Represented by Raphael P.M. Lotilla, Secretary, Department of Energy (DOE) vs. Provincial Government of Palawan, Represented by Governor Abraham Kahlil B. Mitra, G.R. 170867, Jan. 21, 2020)


- In Tamayo v. Manila Hotel Company: it is a rule of statutory construction that "courts will and should respect the contemporaneous construction placed upon a statute by the executive officers, whose duty it is to enforce it and unless such interpretation is clearly erroneous will ordinarily be controlled thereby." (Id.)

Interpretation of 
- It is a fundamental rule in statutory construction that a special law cannot be repealed or modified by a subsequently enacted general law in the absence of any express provision in the latter law to that effect; special law must be interpreted to constitute an exception to the general law in the absence of special circumstances warranting a contrary conclusion. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Bases Conversion and Development Authority, G.R. 217898, Jan. 15, 2020)


- It is settled that between a general law and a special law, the latter prevails; for a special law reveals the legislative intent more clearly than a general law does. Verily, the special law should be deemed an exception to the general law. (Id.)


- The Court has invariably ruled that when the law speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no occasion for interpretation; there is only room for application. (Id.)

Procedural rules 
- It should be emphasized that compliance with procedural rules is necessary for an orderly administration of justice; these rules are not to be rigidly applied so as to frustrate the greater interest of substantial justice; as stated in the Rules of Court, these rules "shall be liberally construed in order to promote their object and to assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding." (Ancheta vs. Villa, G.R. 229634, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Time and again, this Court has relaxed the observance of procedural rules to advance substantial justice; legal technicalities may be excused when strict adherence thereto will impede the achievement of justice it seeks to serve; what should guide judicial action is that a party is given the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of his or her action or defense rather than for him or her to lose life, honor, or property on mere technicalities. (Tan and/or C&L Lending Investor vs. Dagpin, G.R. 212111, Jan. 15, 2020)

Tax laws 
- When an administrative rule is merely interpretative in nature, its applicability needs nothing further than its bare issuance, for it gives no real consequence more than what the law itself has already prescribed; RR 15-2013 is an internal issuance for the guidance of "all internal revenue officers and others concerned," and an interpretative issuance vis-à-vis RA 10378; as such, it need not pass through a public hearing or consultation, get published, nay, registered with the U.P. Law Center for its effectivity. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION

Labor laws 
- The Court has applied the rules of statutory construction to labor legislations and regulations; however, there is no prohibition to the application of these rules to labor contracts, for Article 1702 of the Civil Code itself provides: Article 1702. In case of doubt, all labor legislation and all labor contracts shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living for the laborer. (Del Monte Fresh Produce (Philippines), Inc. vs. Del Monte Fresh Supervisors Union, G.R. 225115, Jan. 27, 2020)

#### TAXATION

BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 
- RMC No. 65-2012, sharply departs from Yamane and the law on condominium corporations; it invalidly declares that the amounts paid as dues or fees by members and tenants of a condominium corporation form part of the gross income of the latter, thus, subject to income tax, value-added tax, and withholding tax; the reason given a condominium corporation furnishes its members and tenants with benefits, advantages, and privileges in return for such payments, consequently, these payments constitute taxable income or compensation for beneficial services it provides to its members and tenants, hence, subject to income tax, value-added tax, and withholding tax. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)

Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
- Section 4 of RA 8424 empowers the BIR Commissioner to interpret tax laws and to decide tax cases; but the BIR Commissioner cannot, in the exercise of such power, issue administrative rulings or circulars inconsistent with the law to be implemented; administrative issuances must not override, supplant, or modify the law, they must remain consistent with the law intended to carry out. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)

Gross Income 
- Gross income means income derived from whatever source, including compensation for services; the conduct of trade or business or the exercise of a profession; dealings in property; interests; rents; royalties; dividends; annuities; prizes and winnings; pensions; and a partner's distributive share in the net income of a general professional partnership, among others. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)

Gross Philippine Billing 
- Demurrage and detention fees definitely form part of an international sea carrier's gross income; for they are acquired in the normal course of trade or business; the phrase "in the course of trade or business" means the regular conduct or pursuit of a commercial or an economic activity, including transactions incidental thereto, by any person regardless of whether or not the person engaged therein is a nonstock, nonprofit private organization (irrespective of the disposition of its net income and whether or not it sells exclusively to members or their guests), or government entity. (Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc., et al. vs. Secretary of Finance, et al., G.R. 222239, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Demurrage fee is the allowance or compensation due to the master or owners of a ship, by the freighter, for the time the vessel may have been detained beyond the time specified or implied in the contract of affreightment or the charter-party; it is only an extended freight or reward to the vessel, in compensation for the earnings the carrier is improperly caused to lose; detention occurs when the consignee holds on to the carrier's container outside of the port, terminal, or depot beyond the free time that is allotted.

- Gross Philippine Billings covers gross revenue derived from transportation of passengers, cargo and/or mail originating from the Philippines up to the final destination; any other income is subject to the regular income tax rate. (Id.)


- Under RR 15-2013, demurrage and detention fees are not deemed within the scope of GPB; for demurrage fees "which are in the nature of rent for the use of property of the carrier in the Philippines, is considered income from Philippine source and is subject to income tax under the regular rate as the other types of income of the on-line carrier; detention fees and other charges "relating to outbound cargoes and inbound cargoes are all considered Philippine-sourced income of international sea carriers they being collected for the use of property or rendition of services in the Philippines, and are subject to the Philippine income tax under the regular rate." (Id.)

Tax Reform Act of 1997 
- Prescription period for violation of the law is five years; as the original information was filed after the five-year prescriptive period, the action had prescribed. (Sze vs. Bureau of Internal Revenue, represented by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. 210238, Jan. 6, 2020)


- Republic Act No. 8424 (RA 8424) or the Tax Reform Act of 1997 was in effect when RMC No. 65-2012 was issued on October 31, 2012; in defining taxable income, Section 31 of RA 8424 states: Section 31; Taxable Income Defined. - The term taxable income means the pertinent items of gross income specified in this Code, less the deductions and/or personal and additional exemptions, if any, authorized for such types of income by this Code or other special laws. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Section 32 of RA 8424 does not include association dues, membership fees, and other assessments/charges collected by condominium corporations as sources of gross income; the subsequent amendment under the TRAIN Law substantially replicates the old Section 32. (Id.)

Value-added tax 
- The value-added tax is a burden on transactions imposed at every stage of the distribution process on the sale, barter, exchange of goods or property, and on the performance of services, even in the absence of profit attributable thereto, so much so that even a non-stock, non-profit organization or government entity, is liable to pay value-added tax on the sale of goods or services. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)

Withholding tax 
- The withholding tax system was devised for three (3) primary reasons, i.e. - (1) to provide taxpayers a convenient manner to meet their probable income tax liability; (2) to ensure the collection of income tax which can otherwise be lost or substantially reduced through failure to file the corresponding returns; and (3) to improve the government's cash flow; this results in administrative savings, prompt and efficient collection of taxes, prevention of delinquencies and reduction of governmental effort to collect taxes through more complicated means and remedies. (In the Matter of Declaratory Relief on the Validity of BIR Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 65-2012 "Clarifying the Taxability of Association Dues, Membership Fees and Other Assessments/charges Collected by Condominium Corporations", G.R. 215801, Jan. 15, 2020)


- Withholding tax is intended to facilitate the collection of income tax and if there is no income tax, withholding tax cannot be collected; Section 57 of RA 8424 directs that only income, be it active or passive, earned by a payor-corporation can be subject to withholding tax. (Id.)

#### THE GENERAL BANKING ACT (R.A. 337)

Section 83 
- Under Section 83 (the DOSRI Law) of the General Banking Act (R.A. 337), the following elements must be present to constitute a violation of the provision: (1) the offender is a director or officer of any banking institution; (2) the offender, either directly or indirectly, for himself or as a representative or agent of another, performs any of the following acts: (a) he borrows any of the deposits or funds of such bank; or (b) he becomes a guarantor, indorser, or surety for loans from such bank to others; or (c) he becomes in any manner an obligor for money borrowed from bank or loaned by it; and (3) the offender has performed any of such acts without the written approval of the majority of the directors of the bank, excluding the offender, as the director concerned. (Soriano vs. People, G.R. 240458, Jan. 8, 2020)

#### UNJUST ENRICHMENT

Principle of 
- Article 2154 of the Civil Code, if something is received when there is no right to demand it, and it was unduly delivered through mistake, the obligation to return it arises; and under Article 2163, there is payment by mistake if something which has never been due or has already been paid is delivered. (Llorent vs. Star City PTY Limited, represented by the Jimeno, G.R. 212050, Jan. 15, 2020)

#### WITNESSES

Credibility of 
- Accused-appellants' uncorroborated defenses of denial and claims of frame-up cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti; the testimonies of police officers who caught the accused-appellants in flagrante delicto are usually credited with more weight and credence, in the absence of evidence that they have been inspired by an improper or ill motive, than the defenses of denial and frame-up of an accused which have been invariably viewed with disfavor for it can easily be concocted. (People vs. Amago, G.R. 227739, Jan. 15, 2020)


- As a general rule, the evaluation of testimonial evidence and the condition of the witnesses by the trial courts is accorded great respect precisely because it is in the best position to observe first-hand the demeanor of the witnesses, a matter which is important in determining whether what has been testified to may be taken to be the truth or falsehood. (Catapang vs. Lipa Bank, G.R. 240645, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Findings and conclusion, there being no showing that the lower courts overlooked or misinterpreted any relevant matters that would influence the outcome of the case; at any rate, the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties. (People vs. Dadang a.k.a. "Manoy," G.R. 242880, Jan. 22, 2020)


- Great respect is given to the trial court's factual findings, particularly when affirmed by the Court of Appeals; this is the general rule, unless the lower courts have "overlooked or misconstrued substantial facts which could have affected the outcome of the case." (People vs. Salen, Jr, G.R. 231013, Jan. 29, 2020)


- In cases where the issue rests on the credibility of witnesses, as in this case, it is important to emphasize the well-settled rule that "appellate courts accord the highest respect to the assessment made by the trial court because of the trial judge's unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grueling examination." (People vs. Adalia, G.R. 235990, Jan. 22, 2020)


- In People v. Cirbeto, this Court underscored that an appellate court can only overturn the trial court's factual findings and replace it with its own factual findings if "there is a showing that the trial court overlooked facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would affect the result of the case." (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)


- In rape cases, the accused may be convicted on the basis of the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the rape victim, provided that her testimony is clear, convincing, and otherwise consistent with human nature; this is a matter best assigned to the trial court which had the first-hand opportunity to hear the testimonies of the witnesses and observe their demeanor, conduct, and attitude during cross-examination. (People vs. Dolandolan, G.R. 232157, Jan. 8, 2020)


- It is inherent in the crime of rape that the conviction of an accused invariably depends upon the credibility of the victim as she is oftentimes the sole witness to the dastardly act; the rule is that when a woman claims that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed and that if her testimony meets the crucible test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on the basis thereof. (Id.)


- It is settled that testimonial evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but must foremost be credible in itself; the test to determine the value or credibility of a witness' testimony is whether the same is in conformity with common knowledge and is consistent with the experience of mankind. (People vs. Carreon, G.R. 229086, Jan. 15, 2020)


- It is settled that the trial court's factual findings, especially when affirmed by the appellate court, are entitled to great respect and generally should not be disturbed on appeal unless certain substantial facts were overlooked which, if considered, may affect the outcome of the case. (People vs. Adalia, G.R. 235990, Jan. 22, 2020)


- It is well-settled that where there is nothing to indicate that a witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated, and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit. (Patungan, Jr. vs. People, G.R. 231827, Jan. 20, 2020)


- It was only after two years, when AAA was in her pre-teens, when she mustered the courage to tell her secret to her mother; the Court accepts AAA's explanation as reasonable justification for the delay in reporting the crime. (People vs. Gratela, G.R. 225961, Jan. 6, 2020)


- Rape is a crime that is almost always committed in isolation or in secret, usually leaving only the victim to testify about the commission of the crime; as such, an accused may be convicted of rape on the basis of the victim's sole testimony provided it is credible, consistent and convincing; when the consistent and forthright testimony of a rape victim is consistent with medical findings, as here, the essential requisites of carnal knowledge are deemed to have been sufficiently established. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230904, Jan. 8, 2020)


- The determination of witnesses' credibility is left to the trial courts, which have the unique opportunity to observe their conduct in court; the trial courts' findings are generally binding on this Court and will not be overturned without a showing of any fact or circumstance that was overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied, which may change the results of a case. (People vs. Pitulan, G.R. 226486, Jan. 22, 2020)


- The trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties, and hence, due deference should be accorded to the same. (People vs. Fornillos @ "Intoy", G.R. 231991, Jan. 27, 2020)


- Well-entrenched is the rule that the matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and position to discriminate between truth and falsehood. (Patungan, Jr. vs. People, G.R. 231827, Jan. 20, 2020)


- When it comes to the credibility of witnesses, the trial court's findings and its calibration of their testimonies' probative weight are accorded high respect and even finality; the trial court's unique vantage point allows it to observe the witnesses during trial, putting it in the best position to determine whether a witness is telling the truth. (People vs. Antonio @ Tokmol, G.R. 229349, Jan. 29, 2020)


- When there are two (2) conflicting testimonies of the same witness pertaining to material points, one inculpatory and the other exculpatory, the latter being compatible with the presumption of innocence and a verdict of acquittal must prevail; the exculpatory evidence emanating from the prosecution itself is an admission against interest, hence, assumes the highest degree of credibility. (People vs. Carreon, G.R. 229086, Jan. 15, 2020)


- While inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony do not necessarily impair her credibility, "for said inconsistencies to be dismissed so as to give full credence to the alleged victim, they must be minor, trivial and as far as practicable, few and far between." (People vs. Dolandolan, G.R. 232157, Jan. 8, 2020)


- While the Court recognizes that a "truth-telling witness is not always expected to give an error-free testimony, considering the lapse of time and treachery of human memory" the prosecution bears the burden of reconciling and explaining any lapses, errors, or inconsistencies in said testimony, in accordance with the principle that the "evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense." (Id.)

## 2020 B

#### ABUSE OF RIGHTS

Bad faith 
- While it has submitted voluminous documents to show that its actions were justified by the terms of the Distributorship Agreement, PELI has not had the opportunity to prove that the foregoing acts mentioned in the Complaint were indeed made without malice and bad faith, since it was not even able to file an answer to Tocoms' complaint; the legal concept of bad faith denotes a dishonest purpose, moral deviation, and a conscious commission of a wrong; it includes "a breach of known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud; it is, therefore, a question of intention, which can be inferred from one's conduct and/or contemporaneous x x x statements"; bad faith under the law cannot be presumed; it must be established by clear and convincing evidence; as such, the case must be reinstated so that PELI may once and for all prove its bona fides in its dealings with Tocoms, in connection with the expiration of their Distribution Agreement. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

Elements 
- Most recently in Chevron Philippines, Inc. v. Mendoza, this Court has held that abuse of rights under Article 19 has three elements, namely: (1) the existence of a legal right or duty, (2) an exercise of such right or discharge of such duty in bad faith, and (3) such exercise of right or discharge of duty was made with the sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another; however, the Court has also held that: There is no hard and fast rule which can be applied to determine whether or not the principle of abuse of rights may be invoked; the question of whether or not the principle of abuse of rights has been violated, resulting in damages under Articles 20 and 21 or other applicable provision of law, depends on the circumstances of each case; cases such as University of the East v. Jader and the Globe Mackay case, where the Court did not utilize the foregoing threefold test in finding a violation of Article 19, have therefore led to the following observation, viz.: The principle of abuse of rights may be invoked if it is proven that a right or duty was exercised in bad faith, regardless of whether it was for the sole intent of injuring another; it is the absence of good faith which is essential for the application of this principle; the foregoing discussion highlights bad faith as the crucial element to a violation of Article 19; the mala fide exercise of a legal right in accordance with Article 19 is penalized by Article 21, under which "any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage"; Article 19 imposes upon all persons exercising their legal rights the duty to act with justice, give everyone his due, and to observe honesty and good faith; failure to discharge such duties is compensable under Article 20 if the act is "contrary to law"; and under Article 21 if the act is legal but "contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy." (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

Nature and purpose 
- The nature and purpose of Article 19 of the Civil Code was discussed in Globe Mackay Radio and Cable Corp. v. CA, viz.: This article, known to contain what is commonly referred to as the principle of abuse of rights, sets certain standards which must be observed not only in the exercise of one's rights but also in the performance of one's duties; these standards are the following: to act with justice; to give everyone his due; and to observe honesty and good faith; the law, therefore, recognizes a primordial limitation on all rights; that in their exercise, the norms of human conduct set forth in Article 19 must be observed; a right, though by itself legal because recognized or granted by law as such, may nevertheless become the source of some illegality; when a light is exercised in a manner which does not conform with the norms enshrined in Article 19 and results in damage to another, a legal wrong is thereby committed for which the wrongdoer must be held responsible; while Article 19 lays down a rule of conduct for the government of human relations and for the maintenance of social order, it does not provide a remedy for its violation; generally, an action for damages under either Article 20 or Article 21 would be proper. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### ABUSE OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH

As a qualifying circumstance 
- Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime; the inequality of forces in this case is beyond doubt; Feliciano, Sr. was a thin 52-year-old man who was slow moving according to his daughter; appellants attacked him with nine (9) persons; the number alone shows the inequality of strength between the victim and the aggressors; coupled with the fact that Feliciano, Sr. was already a frail man, supports the finding of abuse of superior strength; this circumstance qualifies the killing of Feliciano, Sr. into murder. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Abuse of superior strength was also present in the case for the killing of the three victims as there was a notorious inequality of forces between the accused-appellants as police officers and the three who were already weak from the beatings they had endured. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ACTIONS, DISMISSAL OF

Failure to prosecute 
- A dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute operates as a judgment on the merits; expressly provided under Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, as amended; while the Court agrees with petitioners that the dismissal order had the effect of adjudication on the merits, our acquiescence ends there; dismissal with prejudice means that there is an adjudication on the merits as well as a final disposition, barring the right to bring or maintain an action on the same claim or cause; an "adjudication on the merits" for non prosequitor cases imposes as a sanction "prejudice to the refiling of the same claim"; an involuntary dismissal generally acts as a judgment on the merits for the purposes of res judicata. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### ACTIONS, PRESCRIPTION OF

Filing of complaint for illegal dismissal 
- As to the issue on prescription, Gallego timely filed his complaint; repatriated in August 2000, he was repeatedly instructed to wait for the results of the training of the newly recruited crew members of the vessel, M/V Eastern Falcon, he previously boarded, and was likewise promised for re-deployment; Gallego patiently waited for three years or until February 2003; it cannot be said that his cause of action accrued from the time he was repatriated in August 2000 because he was thereafter promised re-deployment; besides, he was illegally dismissed; the prescriptive period to file a complaint for illegal dismissal is four years from the time the cause of action accrued; an action for illegal dismissal or when one is arbitrarily and unjustly deprived of his job or means of livelihood is essentially a complaint for "injury to rights," which falls under Article 1146 of the Civil Code of the Philippines; his filing of the labor complaint is within the four-year prescriptive period from the time the cause of action accrued. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### ALIBI

Defense of 
- For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity; the excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception; where there is the least possibility of accused-appellant's presence at the crime scene, as in this case, the alibi will not hold water; here, "Lawlaw" claims to have been working in the bakery at the time of the incident; aside from being an unsubstantiated claim, it was not shown that it was physically impossible for "Lawlaw" to be at the situs criminis; the alleged bakery is also located at the same barangay where Feliciano, Sr.'s house is located. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT OF 2004 (R.A. 9285) VIS-A-VIS PROHIBITION ON ISSUANCE OF INJUNCTION IN CASES INVOLVING NATIONAL GOVERNMENT PROJECTS (R.A. 8975)

Interim or provisional relief 
- Petitioner adds that there is an extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue making the prohibition under RA 8975 inapplicable; petitioner invokes the third paragraph of Section 3 of RA 8975, but We do not agree; the issue between the parties are purely contractual; in Falcon, it was sharply ruled that, and as applicable herein: In the instant case, the State action being assailed is the DFA's termination of the Amended BOT Agreement with BCA; although the said agreement involves a public service that the DFA is mandated to provide and, therefore, is imbued with public interest, the relationship of DFA to BCA is primarily contractual and their dispute involves the adjudication of contractual rights; the propriety of the DFA's acts, in relation to the termination of the Amended BOT Agreement, should be gauged against the provisions of the contract itself and the applicable statutes to such contract; these contractual and statutory provisions outline what constitutes due process in the present case; BCA failed to demonstrate that there is a constitutional issue involved in this case, much less a constitutional issue of extreme urgency. (Busan Universal Rail, Inc. vs. Department of Transportation – Metro Rail Transit 3, G.R. 235878, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The parties actually agree that the dispute between them arising from the MRT3 Contract should be referred to arbitration; the MRT3 Contract was entered into as a result of a negotiated procurement under R.A. 9184, or the Government Procurement Reform Act; under Section 28 of R.A. 9285 or the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, as referred to in Section 59, Rule XVIII of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9184, the grant of an interim measure of protection by the proper court before the constitution of an arbitral tribunal is allowed; however, R.A. 8975 prohibits the issuance of temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions against national government project; on the application of RA 9285 vis-à-vis RA 8975, the case of Falcon is instructive: Republic Act No. 9285 is a general law applicable to all matters and controversies to be resolved through alternative dispute resolution methods; this law allows a Regional Trial Court to grant interim or provisional relief, including preliminary injunction, to parties in an arbitration case prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal; this general statute, however, must give way to a special law governing national government projects, R.A. 8975 which prohibits courts, except the Supreme Court, from issuing TROs and writs of preliminary injunction in cases involving national government projects; a court's grant of injunctive relief in such an instance is prejudicial to public interest since government would be indefinitely hampered in its duty to provide vital public goods and services in order to preserve the private propriety rights of the project proponent; the only circumstance under which a court may grant injunctive relief is the existence of a matter of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a TRO or injunctive writ is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will result; inasmuch as petitioner was seeking to restrain respondent from terminating the MRT3 Contract, the cited pronouncements in Falcon find application; the RTC properly dismissed petitioner's petition. (Busan Universal Rail, Inc. vs. Department of Transportation – Metro Rail Transit 3, G.R. 235878, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### AN ACT TO ENSURE THE EXPEDITIOUS IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BY PROHIBITING LOWER COURTS FROM ISSUING TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS, PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS OR PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTIONS, PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF, AND OTHER PURPOSES (R.A. 8975)

Issuance of temporary restraining orders and writs of preliminary injunction 
- Section 3 of R.A. 8975 expressly vests jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court to issue any TRO, preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction against the government, or any of its subdivisions, officials or any person or entity, whether public or private acting under the government's direction, to restrain, prohibit or compel specified acts; in Philco Aero, Inc. v. Secretary Tugade, this Court recognized the remedy of resorting directly before this Court in cases covered under R.A. 8975; Section 3 thereof was explicit in excluding other courts in the issuance of injunctive writs; however, in Bases Conversion and Development Authority v. Uy, this Court clarified that the prohibition applies only to TRO and preliminary injunction, viz.: A perusal of these aforequoted provisions readily reveals that all courts, except this Court, are proscribed from issuing TROs and writs of preliminary injunction against the implementation or execution of specified government projects; thus, the ambit of the prohibition covers only temporary or preliminary restraining orders or writs but NOT decisions on the merits granting permanent injunctions; considering that these laws trench on judicial power, they should be strictly construed; therefore, while courts below this Court are prohibited by these laws from issuing temporary or preliminary restraining orders pending the adjudication of the case, said statutes however do not explicitly proscribe the issuance of a permanent injunction granted by a court of law arising from an adjudication of a case on the merits. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### ANTI-GRAFT AND CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (R.A. 3019)

Elements 
- In PCGG v. Office of the Ombudsman, the Court reiterated the well-settled elements of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 as follows: (i) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions, or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers; (ii) that he acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (iii) that his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions. (Canlas vs. People, et al., G.R. Nos. 236308-09, Feb. 17, 2020)

Section 3(e) 
- The well-settled rule is that "private persons, when acting in conspiracy with public officers, may be indicted and, if found guilty, held liable for the pertinent offenses under Section 3 of R.A. 3019, in consonance with the avowed policy of the anti-graft law to repress certain acts of public officers and private persons alike constituting graft or corrupt practices act or which may lead thereto"; the Court, in various cases, had the occasion to affirm the indictment and/or conviction of a private individual, acting in conspiracy with public officers, for violation of Section 3 of R.A. 3019 particularly paragraph (e) thereof. (Canlas vs. People, et al., G.R. Nos. 236308-09, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ANTI-SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACT (R.A. 7877)

Liability of employer 
- The distinction between the employer and an erring managerial officer is likewise present in sexual harassment cases; under Section 5 of the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act, the employer is only solidarity liable for damages with the perpetrator in case an act of sexual harassment was reported and it did not take immediate action on the matter; this provision thus illustrates that the employer must first be informed of the acts of the erring managerial officer before it can be held liable for the latter's acts; conversely, if the employer has been informed of the acts of its managerial staff, and does not contest or question it, it is deemed to have authorized or be complicit to the acts of its erring employee; Batucan cannot be considered to have been acting on petitioner's behalf when he sexually harassed respondent; thus, respondent cannot base her illegal dismissal complaint against petitioner solely on Batucan's acts; however, even if petitioner had no participation in the sexual harassment, it had been informed of the incident; despite this, it failed to take immediate action on respondent's complaint; its lack of prompt action reinforced the hostile work environment created by Batucan. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

Workplace sexual harassment 
- Workplace sexual harassment occurs when a supervisor, or agent of an employer, or any other person who has authority over another in a work environment, imposes sexual favors on another, which creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the latter; "the gravamen of the offense in sexual harassment is not the violation of the employee's sexuality but the abuse of power by the employer." (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### APPEAL IN CRIMINAL CASES

Appeal by any of several accused 
- Fulgado must be and is so acquitted for failure of the prosecution to justify the arresting officers' non-compliance with the three-witness rule under Section 21 of R.A. 9165; Tamayo, Fulgado's co-accused in this case, must perforce be acquitted as well considering that (1) under Section 11 (a), Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, a favorable judgment shall benefit the co-accused who did not appeal; and (2) the evidence against and the conviction of Tamayo and Fulgado are inextricably linked; hence, the acquittal of Fulgado based on reasonable doubt should likewise apply to her co-accused Tamayo albeit no appeal was filed by the latter. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)

Civil liability 
- It is settled that in criminal cases, the State is the offended party and the private complainant's interest is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom; hence, if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, a reconsideration of the order of dismissal or acquittal may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, insofar as the criminal aspect thereof is concerned and may be made only by the public prosecutor; or in the case of an appeal, by the State only, through the Office of the Solicitor General; the private complainant or offended party may not undertake such motion for reconsideration or appeal on the criminal aspect of the case; however, the offended party or private complainant may file a motion for reconsideration of such dismissal or acquittal or appeal therefrom but only insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned; the rationale behind this rule is that in a criminal case, the party affected by the dismissal of the criminal action is the State and not the private complainant; the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited only to the civil liability; in the prosecution of the offense, the complainant's role is limited to that of a witness for the prosecution such that when a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal therefrom on the criminal aspect may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General; the private offended party or complainant may not take such appeal, but may only do so as to the civil aspect of the case. (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)

Concept 
- In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors; the appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The Court has definitively ruled that in a criminal case in which the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom; if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal of the criminal aspect may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, only by the State through the Solicitor General; as a rule, only the Solicitor General may represent the People of the Philippines on appeal; the private offended party or complainant may not undertake such appeal; in its petition for certiorari filed with the RTC, petitioner seeks the annulment of the MTC decision acquitting herein respondents; in so doing, petitioner raises issues on the admissibility of evidence which it submitted to prove the guilt of the accused; these issues necessarily require a review of the criminal aspect of the case and, as such, is prohibited; only the State, and not herein petitioner, who is the private offended party, may question the criminal aspect of the case. (Id.)

#### APPEALS

Appeal bond 
- This procedural rule may be relaxed in the interest of substantial justice; first, the case was already in its execution stage; BATELEC II had already posted an appeal bond when it appealed the case for the first time on its merit; the purpose of an appeal bond, which is to ensure, during the period of appeal, against any occurrence that would defeat or diminish recovery by the aggrieved employees under the judgment if subsequently affirmed, has in fact been satisfied; the winning party was already secured of payment by the losing party, or in default thereof, by the surety company; second, at the time when an appeal was made from the March 22, 2002 NLRC Resolution, the final award, upon which the bond should be based, has not yet been settled; in the fairly recent case of Sara Lee Philippines, Inc. v. Macatlang, the Court decreed that the NLRC may dispense with the posting of the bond when the judgment award is: (1) not stated or (2) based on a patently erroneous computation. (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Appeal in labor cases 
- "As a general rule, a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court covers only questions of law; questions of fact are not reviewable and cannot be passed upon by the Court in the exercise of its power to review under Rule 45"; nevertheless, this rule admits of certain exceptions, such as: 1. when the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; 2. when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3. when there is grave abuse of discretion; 4. when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5. when the findings of fact are conflicting; 6. when in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; 7. when the findings are contrary to that of the trial court; 8. when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9. when the facts set forth in the petition, as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs, are not disputed by the respondent; 10. when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and 11. when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; the present case falls under one of the exceptions. (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In labor cases, a Rule 45 petition is limited to reviewing whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and deciding other jurisdictional errors of the NLRC; the CA correctly found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it affirmed the ruling of the LA and upheld the medical assessment issued by Solacito's personal physician over the one issued by the company-designated physicians; however, the CA erred in independently giving a disability rating to Solacito and awarding partial and permanent disability benefits. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court may review factual issues in a labor case when the factual findings are in conflict; although as a rule this Court may only review questions of law, however, in exceptional cases, it may review the facts in labor cases where the findings of the CA and of the labor tribunals are contradictory, which is the case herein. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452. Feb. 12, 2020)


- We do not subscribe to the NLRC's interpretation of the rule on appeal bond, specifically that which dispenses with the requirement of an appeal bond if "the order appealed from is not an original decision of the Labor Arbiter affecting the whole spectrum of the instant case"; in Toyota Alabang, Inc. v. Games, this Court was emphatic in declaring that Article 223 of the Labor Code and Section 6, Rule VI of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure "do not limit the appeal bond requirement only to certain kinds of rulings of the Labor Arbiter; rather, these rules generally state that in case the ruling of the Labor Arbiter involves a monetary award, an employer's appeal may be perfected only upon the posting of a bond; absent any qualifying terms, so long as the decision of the Labor Arbiter involves a monetary award, as in this case, that ruling can only be appealed after the employer posts a bond." (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Appeal to the Court of Appeals 
- In an appeal to the CA, whether under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, or via certiorari under Rule 45 of the same rules, the mode depends primarily on the Decision or Order being appealed from; if it is a final judgment, then the appeal must be filed within 15 days from receipt of the same; or if it is an appeal against an interlocutory order, a petition for certiorari may be resorted to under the ultimate paragraph of Section 1, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, by virtue of which the aggrieved party may institute an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65; it was error for petitioner to treat the dismissal as an interlocutory order, because it was in fact a final judgment. (Domingo vs. Macapagal, G.R. 242577, Feb. 26, 2020)

Factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial agencies 
- Considering that the findings of the DAR-Region VIII, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator, and the DARAB Central Office are similar in all material respects, these should not be disturbed, more so in this case where the CA sustained such findings; "the factual findings of administrative agencies and officials that have acquired expertise in the performance of their official duties and in the exercise of their primary jurisdiction are generally accorded not only respect but, at times, even finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence"; such factual findings, especially when affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Court. (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In petitions for review on certiorari, only questions of law may be raised by the parties and passed upon by the Court; as a general rule, factual findings of administrative agencies, such as the CSC, that are affirmed by the CA, are conclusive upon and generally not reviewable by the Court, unless these findings are not supported by substantial evidence. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The rule is that the factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies such as the NLRC are generally accorded not only respect, but at times, even finality because of the special knowledge and expertise they have gained from handling matters falling under their specialized jurisdiction; similarly, factual findings of the CA are generally not subject to the Court's review in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; the Court is not a trier of facts, and this rule applies with greater force in labor cases; the Court is not swayed by petitioners' claim that their statements were done with good intention and justifiable motives; neither is the Court moved by petitioners' assertion that the CA erred in not giving weight to the sworn statement of their witness, to the effect that they did not utter the alleged libelous statements being attributed to them; these matters are outside this Court's authority to act; only questions of law are entertained in a Rule 45 petition; as held in Madridejos v. NYK-FIL Ship Management, Inc., the Court does not re-examine conflicting evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of the NLRC, an administrative body that has expertise in its specialized field; the Court does not replace its own judgment for that of the tribunal in determining where the weight of evidence lies or what evidence is credible. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Factual findings of the Court of Appeals 
- Petitions for review under Rule 45 are limited to questions of law; thus, factual findings of the CA, when supported by substantial evidence, are binding upon this Court, for the simple reason that the CA is still a trial court, while this Court is not a trier of facts; however, such rule does not apply when the findings of the appellate court conflict with those of the trial court. (Dalida vs. Concepcion Bohol-Zenoni, G.R. 214649, Feb. 26, 2020)

Factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals 
- Time and again, great weight and highest respect are accorded to the factual findings of the CTA; the Court will not review nor disturb the CTA's factual determination when it is supported by substantial evidence and there is no showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the CTA, as in this case. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Chevron Holdings, Inc. [Formerly Caltex (Asia) Limited], G.R. 233301, Feb. 17, 2020)

Factual findings of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) 
- It is well settled in labor cases that the factual findings of the NLRC are accorded respect and even finality by the Court when they coincide with those of the LA and are supported by substantial evidence; here, the CA affirmed the findings of fact of the LA and the NLRC with respect to the dismissal from service of petitioners for just causes; the CA noted that both the LA and the NLRC found petitioners to have uttered libelous statements against respondent SPC and held that such act constitutes serious misconduct, which is a ground for the termination of their employment. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Factual findings of the trial court 
- Ordinarily, the Court refrains from disturbing the factual findings and conclusions of the RTC, especially when affirmed by the CA; however, the Court will not hesitate to do so where the lower courts overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, would affect the outcome of the case – as here. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The courts below held Arriola criminally liable for Estafa by false deceits under Article 315, Paragraph 2(a) of the RPC; ordinarily, this Court desists from trifling with the findings of facts by the courts below; findings by trial courts are generally accorded with great respect by the appellate courts, more so that the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts but of questions of law; for this case, however, We defer to one of the prevailing exceptions listed by jurisprudence, that is, when the findings of fact by the trial court were conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; the courts below correctly convicted Arriola, but not much substantial discussion was made on the falsity of his representations and the documentary evidence thereof. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 
- By filing a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court to assail the CA Decision dated December 12, 2016 and Resolution dated May 25, 2017, petitioner availed herself of the wrong remedy; the proper remedy to question a CA's judgment, final order or resolution, as in the instant case, is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the same Rules; under Supreme Court Circular 2-90, an appeal taken to this Court or to the CA by a wrong or an inappropriate mode warrants its outright dismissal; the Court reminds petitioner, as it has consistently reminded countless other litigants, that the invocation of substantial justice is not a magic potion that automatically compels the Court to set aside technical rules; a petition for certiorari under Rule 45 must be filed within 15 days from notice of the judgment, final order or resolution appealed from; or of the denial of petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment; petitioner received the CA Resolution denying her motion for reconsideration on June 19, 2017 and filed the instant petition 46 days later or on August 4, 2017, by which time she had already lost her appeal under Rule 45. (Fernandez vs. Court of Appeals, Twenty-Third Division, Cagayan de Oro City, et al., G.R. 233460, Feb. 19, 2020)


- It is a settled rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; this Court is not a trier of facts; hence, it will not entertain questions of facts as it is bound by the findings of fact made by the CA when supported by substantial evidence; there are, however, exceptions to the rule wherein the Court may pass upon and review the findings of fact by the CA; instances enumerated in Medina v. Asistio, Jr., to wit: (1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record; the instant case falls under the exceptions. (Social Security System vs. Seno, Jr., et al., G.R. 183478, Feb. 10, 2020)


- Rule 45, Section 1 of the Rules of Court authorizes direct resort from the Regional Trial Courts to this Court on pure questions of law; in Uy v. Chua, this Court gave due course to a Petition for Review against a Resolution of the RTC on the issue of res judicata; the present petition does not raise any factual question; the petition poses a sole question: Which tribunal has jurisdiction over the suit for damages filed by the spouses Ang? This question does not involve any determination or finding of truth or falsehood of the factual allegations raised by the spouses Ang; but instead concerns the applicability of the construction arbitration laws to the suit filed by the spouses; direct resort to this Court is therefore justified. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)


- The other issues raised by petitioner Spouses are clearly factual in nature; these issues cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition wherein the Court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing and revising errors of law that might have been committed by the lower courts; the Petition should be denied in the absence of any exceptional circumstance as to merit the Court's review of factual questions that have already been settled by the tribunals below. (Spouses Garcia, doing business under the name and style of Ecolamp Multi-Resources vs. Northern Islands, Co., Inc., G.R. 226495, Feb. 5, 2020)

Petition for review under Rule 43 
- In not a few instances, the Court has variably applied the 10-day period provided in Article 276 of the Labor Code and the 15-day period in Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court in determining the proper period of appeal from a decision or award rendered by a Voluntary Arbitrator or a Panel thereof to the CA; Guagua National Colleges v. Court of Appeals, cited; in this case, the Court ruled that the 10-day period stated in Article 276 of the Labor Code should be understood as the period within which the party adversely affected by the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrator or the Panel may file a motion for reconsideration; this is in line with the pronouncement in Teng v. Pahagac where the Court had clarified that the 10-day period set in Article 276 of the Labor Code gave the aggrieved parties the opportunity to file their motion for reconsideration; in Guagua, once the motion for reconsideration interposed had been resolved, the aggrieved party may now opt to appeal to the CA by way of a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court; pursuant to Section 4 of the said Rule, the aggrieved party has 15 days to file the same; respondents' appeal had clearly been filed within the reglementary period provided in Rule 43. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

Points of law, issues, theories, and arguments 
- A motion to dismiss which has been granted on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter operates as a dismissal without prejudice; such order is not subject to an appeal under Section 1 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court; the remedy of the aggrieved party is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65; here, not only did petitioners avail of the wrong remedy by filing an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45, but they likewise violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts in assailing the twin Resolutions of the RTC, directly before us. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)


- It is hornbook law that issues and arguments not presented before the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; an issue that was neither averred in the complaint nor raised during the trial cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, for to do so would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- The Court finds no merit in respondents' argument that the present petition should be dismissed for failure to implead the CA as a public respondent; what petitioner filed is a petition for review on certiorari; unlike in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, wherein the public respondent is included as a nominal party, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court does not require the public respondent to be impleaded. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The Municipality of Cainta directly filed this petition; the established policy is to strictly observe the judicial hierarchy of courts; however, Section 2(c), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court allows a party to question the decision of the RTC directly to this Court on pure questions of law; a question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for the examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsity of facts being admitted; a question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence. (Municipality of Cainta, Rizal vs. Spouses Braña, et al., G.R. 199290, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The Notice of Appeal filed by Fulgado in accordance with Rule 122, Section 3(e), in relation to Rule 124, Section 13(c) of the Rules of Court opens the entire case for review by the Court on any question be it one of fact or law, or mixed, and even one not raised by the parties. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Whether a deed of absolute sale is genuine is a question of fact not proper in a petition for review on certiorari, as only questions of law may be raised in a petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; moreover, the trial court's factual findings, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are generally conclusive upon this Court. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

Questions of fact 
- Petitioners resurfaced its arguments on the legality of Dela Cruz's dismissal, and surrendered the issue on the timeliness of Dela Cruz's appeal; the Court is thus called to resolve the issues of whether Dela Cruz was terminated or suspended; whether, in either case, the substantive and procedural requirements were met; and whether Dela Cruz abandoned her employment; these issues are factual in nature and should have been raised by the petitioners in their motion for reconsideration from the NLRC's Decision dated June 28, 2013, and should have been pleaded by petitioners before the CA if only to aid the appellate court in determining the paramount issue of whether the NLRC acted capriciously or despotically; the Court generally does not entertain questions of fact in a petition for review on certiorari; because the rulings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC are conflicting, and, to write an end to the controversy, we deem it of sound judicial economy to proceed with the issue as regards the legality of Dela Cruz's dismissal. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The prosecution's evidence is sufficient to uphold the findings of fact against petitioner; questions of fact may no longer be raised in Rule 45 petitions; here, the Municipal Trial Court, the Regional Trial Court, and the Court of Appeals all consistently found that petitioner slapped and kicked P02 Navarro while he was on official duty as a police officer; the lower courts arrived at this conclusion after thoroughly examining both parties' evidence; this Court will no longer disturb their uniform findings. (Mallari vs. People, G.R. 224679, Feb. 12, 2020)

Questions of fact and question of law 
- Questions of fact raised in this petition are not proper under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain set of facts, while a question of fact arises when there is doubt as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts; for a question to be one of law, it must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants; the resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts and circumstances; once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question is one of fact; Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact. (Republic vs. Castillo, et al., G.R. 190453, Feb. 26, 2020)

Questions of law 
- It is recognized under Rule 45 that an appeal from the trial court's decision may be undertaken through a petition for review on certiorari directly filed with the Court where only questions of law are raised or involved; a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts; for a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants, but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts; if the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact; the test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact; an examination of the present petition shows petitioner essentially challenging the dismissal of the case based solely on the premise that a ruling on ownership in an ejectment case is merely ancillary to resolve the issue of possession and should not bind the title or ownership of the land; this is clearly a question of law which calls for an examination and interpretation of the prevailing law and jurisprudence. (Tiña vs. Sta. Clara Estate, Inc., G.R. 239979, Feb. 17, 2020)

Service of the appeal 
- Pursuant to Section 5, Rule 56 of the Rules of Court, aside from petitioners' duty to supply this Court with the correct address of respondents as proof of service of the appeal, it is beholden upon them to comply with all directives or orders from the Court within a reasonable period; for petitioners' failure to comply with the Court's directives without justifiable cause, the present petition should be dismissed motu proprio; petitioners' inaction had already caused the arbitrary dragging of this petition for review on certiorari which had been pending since February 23, 2013 and to await for the parties' compliance would again put in jeopardy the timely resolution of this appeal. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### ARBITRARY DETENTION

Elements 
- Arbitrary Detention is committed by any public officer or employee who, without legal grounds, detains a person; the elements of the crime are: (1) the offender is a public officer or employee; (2) he detains a person; and (3) the detention is without legal grounds. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ATTEMPTED FELONY

Elements 
- The essential elements of an attempted felony are as follows: (1) the offender commences the commission of the felony directly by overt acts; (2) he does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony; (3) the offender's act be not stopped by his own spontaneous desistance; and (4) the non-performance of all acts of execution was due to cause or accident other than his spontaneous desistance. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ATTEMPTED OR FRUSTRATED MURDER

Elements 
- With respect to attempted or frustrated murder, the principal and essential element thereof is the intent on the part of the assailant to take the life of the person attacked; such intent must be proved in a clear and evident manner to exclude every possible doubt as to the homicidal intent of the aggressor; intent to kill is a specific intent that the State must allege in the information, and then prove by either direct or circumstantial evidence, as differentiated from a general criminal intent, which is presumed from the commission of a felony by dolo; intent to kill, being a state of mind, is discerned by the courts only through external manifestations, i.e., the acts and conduct of the accused at the time of the assault and immediately thereafter; the following factors are considered, namely: (1) the means used by the malefactors; (2) the nature, location, and number of wounds sustained by the victim; (3) the conduct of the malefactors before, during, or immediately after the killing of the victim; and (4) the circumstances under which the crime was committed and the motives of the accused. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ATTEMPTED THEFT

Elements 
- Even if the seized ink cartridges were admitted in evidence, the Court agrees with the OSG that the probative value of these pieces of evidence must still meet the various tests by which their reliability is to be determined; their tendency to convince and persuade must be considered separately because admissibility of evidence is different from its probative value; as contended by the OSG, "even granting arguendo that the MTC indeed committed an error in ruling that there was illegal search and seizure in this case, the prosecution still has to prove that the seized cartridges were indeed the property of petitioner"; however, the prosecution failed in this respect; this Court agrees with the OSG that since the employee of petitioner who allegedly discovered the theft of the subject cartridges, and who was supposedly the one who put identifying marks thereon was not presented in court, nobody could verify if the cartridges seized from respondents were the ones missing from the stockroom; the Court finds neither error nor grave abuse of discretion on the part of the MTC when it ruled that the prosecution failed to prove the essential element of taking in the alleged crime of theft. (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### ATTORNEYS

Administrative proceedings against 
- Respondent obtained a loan from complainant in the amount of P500,000.00 and in exchange thereof issued a worthless check to complainant; this fact alone is a ground for disciplinary action as it constitutes gross misconduct; it indicates his unfitness for the trust and confidence reposed upon him and his lack of personal honesty and good moral character rendering him unworthy of public confidence; in Ong v. Atty. Delos Santos, the Court explained that a lawyer who issues a worthless check is in breach of his oath to obey the laws; respondent, as a lawyer, should know that issuing a worthless check is a violation of The Bouncing Checks Laws (B.P. Blg. 22) for which he may be disciplined under Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court. (Andaya vs. Atty. Tumanda, A.C. No. 12209, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The Court finds it appropriate to impose on respondent the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of three (3) years and a fine in the amount of P15,000.00, as recommended by the IBP Board of Governors, in line with the Court's ruling in similar cases; in Spouses Lopez v. Limos, the erring lawyer was suspended for three (3) years for violating Canon 11, Rule 12.04 of Canon 12, Rules 16.01 and 16.03 of Canon 16, and Rule 18.03 of Canon 18 of the CPR, among others; in Go v. Buri, the erring lawyer was suspended for two (2) years for violating Canon 16 and Rule 18.03 of Canon 18 of the CPR, among others, and ordered to pay a fine for failure to comply with the IBP-CBD's order to file an answer despite due notice. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)


- When lawyers, in the performance of their duties, act in a manner that prejudices not only the rights of their clients, but also of their colleagues and their colleagues' clients, appropriate disciplinary measures under the law, such as suspension and disbarment, must apply to rectify their wrongful acts. Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides: SEC. 27. Disbarment or suspension of attorneys by Supreme Court; grounds therefor. - A member of the bar may be disbarred or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before admission to practice, or for a willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court, or for corruptly or willfully appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do; the practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of gain, either personally or through paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice. (Pagdanganan vs. Plata, A.C. No. 12701 [C.B.D. 12-3626], Feb. 26, 2020)

Attorney-client relationship 
- Atty. Mahinay did not unfairly criticize or disrespect Judge Medina in any way; on the contrary, he had, in fact, been circumspect in choosing the language he used in crafting his motion for reconsideration; at most, he might have been overzealous in defending his clients' cause, but this is not necessarily bad; the Court has always been mindful of the lawyer's bounden duty to defend his client's cause with utmost zeal for as long as he or she stays within the limits imposed by professional rules; Atty. Mahinay did not overstep these limits. (Zamora vs. Atty. Mahinay, A.C. No. 12622, Feb. 10, 2020 [Formerly CBD Case No. 15-4651])


- The filing of the administrative claim by respondents' counsel of record on behalf of their client gave rise to the presumption that they have the authority to file the same; this is anchored on the rule that "a lawyer is presumed to be properly authorized to represent any cause in which he appears, and no written power of attorney is required to authorize him to appear in court for his client"; the presumption in favor of the counsel's authority to appear in behalf of its client is a strong one, as it arises from the lawyer's pledge to act with honesty, candor and fairness and not to do any falsehood or misrepresentation; if a lawyer corruptly or willfully appears as an attorney for a party to a case without authority, he may be disciplined or punished for contempt as an officer of the court who has misbehaved in his official transaction; an attorney's appearance is also presumed to be with the previous knowledge and consent of the litigant until the contrary is shown. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The supposed lack of authority of respondents' counsel of record was thereafter cured when respondents executed a Special Power of Attorney and submitted the same with the CIR and before the court a quo; the CTA held that the said instrument clearly spells out the extent of authority granted to respondents' counsel and ratifies all prior acts done in pursuit of said authority, which includes the filing of respondents' administrative claim for refund; in Land Bank of the Philippines v. Pamintuan Dev't. Co., the Court held that "ratification retroacts to the date of the lawyer's first appearance and validates the action taken by him"; the effect is as if respondents themselves filed the administrative claim for refund on May 21, 2014, within the two-year prescriptive period provided under the NIRC of 1997, as amended; respondents' administrative claim was valid and timely filed. (Id.)


- Upon complainant's demand, respondent refused to return the amount of P244,865.00 he received as legal fees as well as all pertinent documents entrusted to him by complainant, including the original copy of OCT No. M-3772; respondent did not even offer any justifiable reason for such continued refusal; clearly, such act constitutes a violation of Canon 16 and Rules 16.01 and 16.03 of the CPR; the relationship between a lawyer and his client is highly fiduciary and prescribes on a lawyer a great fidelity and good faith; the highly fiduciary nature of this relationship imposes upon the lawyer the duty to account for the money or property collected or received for or from his client; thus, a lawyer's failure to return upon demand the funds held by him on behalf of his client, as in this case, gives rise to the presumption that he has appropriated the same for his own use in violation of the trust reposed in him by his client; this act is a gross violation of general morality, as well as of professional ethics. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)

Compliance with IBP'S lawful directives 
- To further aggravate respondent's administrative liability, the Court notes respondent's repeated disregard of the IBP-CBD's orders and proceedings; records show that despite being required to do so, respondent failed to file his answer, mandatory conference brief, and position paper; he also failed to appear at the schedule mandatory conference despite due notice; respondent merely filed a motion to reset the mandatory conference and to hold in abeyance the filing of his position paper, which caused undue delay in the resolution of the instant administrative case, in violation of Canons 11, 12, and Rule 12.04 of the CPR; as a member of the IBP, respondent is duty-bound to comply with all the IBP's lawful directives in deference to its authority over him. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)

Conduct of 
- A penalty of one-year suspension from the practice of law is usually imposed upon a lawyer who issues a worthless check; considering the attendant circumstances in the instant case, the Court agrees with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) and the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) that the penalty imposed should be increased to three years; aside from issuing a worthless check, respondent has acted in utmost bad faith when he sold to another person the Mercedes Benz he previously sold to complainant as full payment for the loan obligation; such act is a clear violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR); further, his deliberate failure to settle his obligation despite repeated demands is in itself a gross misconduct; also, respondent has been using several addresses to avoid being traced and to evade his obligation to complainant; respondent even refused to answer the accusations against him and to appear in the mandatory conferences despite due notice, thereby causing undue delay in the resolution of the instant case. (Andaya vs. Atty. Tumanda, A.C. No. 12209, Feb. 18, 2020)


- Lawyers are licensed officers of the courts who are empowered to appear, prosecute, and defend; and upon whom peculiar duties, responsibilities, and liabilities are devolved by law as a consequence; membership in the Bar imposes upon them certain obligations; mandated to maintain the dignity of the legal profession, they must conduct themselves honorably and fairly; any violation of these standards exposes the lawyer to administrative liability; case law instructs that "lawyers should treat their opposing counsels and other lawyers with courtesy, dignity, and civility; a great part of their comfort, as well as of their success at the bar, depends upon their relations with their professional brethren; since they deal constantly with each other, they must treat one another with trust and respect; any undue ill feeling between clients should not influence counsels in their conduct and demeanor toward each other; mutual bickering, unjustified recriminations, and offensive behavior among lawyers not only detract from the dignity of the legal profession, but also constitute highly unprofessional conduct subject to disciplinary action"; in Noble III v. Ailes, the Court held that the hurling of insulting language to describe the opposing counsel is considered conduct unbecoming of the legal profession which, as ruled in Buot v. Jubay, should never be countenanced as it tends to degrade the dignity of the legal profession. (Nava II vs. Atty. Artuz, A.C. No. 7253, Feb. 18, 2020)


- Respondent's acts of calling Atty. Nava II and his father "barbaric, nomadic, and outrageous" and baselessly imputing to Atty. Nava II the use of his alleged influence as the godson of the City Prosecutor who, by virtue thereof, allegedly had the audacity to display "his bad manners and wrong conduct and arrogance" in an official pleading falls short of the conduct being exhorted by Canon 8 to all members of the Bar; such use of intemperate language and aspersions has no place in the dignity of judicial forum; membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions such that a lawyer's words and actions directly affect the public's opinion of the legal profession; any violation of these conditions exposes the lawyer to administrative liability, as in this case; respondent had violated several canons of professional and ethical conduct expected from her as a lawyer and an officer of the court; membership in the legal profession is a privilege, and whenever it is made to appear that an attorney is no longer worthy of the trust and confidence of his clients and the public, it becomes not only the right but also the duty of the Court to withdraw the same; she is DISBARRED from the practice of law and her name is ordered STRICKEN off the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. (Nava II vs. Atty. Artuz, A.C. No. 7253, Feb. 18, 2020)

Deceit —The Court finds Salgado guilty of deceit; from the evidence presented by Lapitan, which was not refuted by Salgado after due notice, it is clear that Salgado had no intention to pay the contracted amount for the 26 June 2010 event; the records show that the contract amount has not been settled by Salgado to this date; Salgado committed deceit by making it appear that he forgot to bring with him the necessary cash to pay for the contracted amount when the terms of the banquet event contract clearly indicate that the fifty percent (50 percent ) down payment should have been made as early as upon signing the contract; instead, Salgado employed deceit in convincing Lapitan that he would pay the total contracted amount upon the event's conclusion and Lapitan believed Salgado in good faith knowing that the latter was a lawyer and was fully aware of his legal obligation to pay the terms of the contract; Salgado employed deceit on Lapitan when instead of paying in cash after the event, Salgado issued a worthless postdated check three (3) days after the completion of the event or on 29 June 2010; clear and preponderant evidence was presented by Lapitan which remained unrebutted by Salgado who refused to participate in the IBP-CBD proceedings even after notices were sent to both Salgado's previous and present addresses; consequently, the evidence presented by Lapitan stands. (Lapitan vs. Atty. Salgado, A.C. No. 12452, Feb. 18, 2020)

Disbarment 
- Every person is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; settled is the rule that in disbarment proceedings, the complainant must satisfactorily establish the allegations of his or her complaint through substantial evidence; mere allegations without proof are disregarded considering the gravity of the penalty prayed for; charges based on mere suspicion and speculation cannot be given credence; the Court agrees with the IBP that the complained act does not constitute any violation of the Rules of Court, the Notarial Rules, nor the Code of Professional Responsibility; respondent merely performed his duty when he attested to the fact that Lotho personally appeared and signed the said letter before him; We agree with the IBP that the truth or falsity of the contents of the letter is the responsibility of the affiant Lotho and not of the respondent, especially since no substantial evidence was presented to prove that he knowingly notarized a false document. (ICK, et al. vs. Atty. Amazona, A.C. No. 12375, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Salgado clearly continues to disregard the lawful orders of the Court; Salgado remains a fugitive from justice in both his Estafa case under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code before the Regional Trial Court of Tagaytay City and violation of B.P. Blg. 22 in the Municipal Trial Court of Tagaytay City; Salgado has evaded both proceedings before the trial courts and the IBP-CBD; as a member of the legal profession, Salgado has the duty to obey the orders and processes of the Court; the conduct of Salgado clearly demonstrates the lack of respect for the Court and the Court's lawful procedures which cannot be tolerated by the Court; Section 5(5), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution recognizes the Court's authority to discipline members of the Bar; in Sps. Floran v. Atty. Ediza, the Court held that in imposing the penalty of disbarment, the Court is aware that the power to disbar is a power exercised by the Court with utmost caution and such power is solely exercised only in cases of misconduct that seriously affect the moral standing and character of members of the Bar as officers of the Court; the practice of law is not a vested right but a privilege, a privilege clothed with public interest; to enjoy the privilege of practicing law as officers of the Court, lawyers must adhere to the rigid standards of mental fitness and maintain the highest degree of morality; Salgado's utmost disrespect to the Courts' proceedings coupled with his deceitful conduct on Lapitan warrant such grave penalty. (Lapitan vs. Atty. Salgado, A.C. No. 12452, Feb. 18, 2020)


- While lawyers are mandated to act with dignity and in a manner that inspires confidence to the legal profession, their rights must still be protected just like every ordinary individual; the legal profession and the threat of disbarment should not be used as a means to provoke lawyers who are acting well within their rights. (Spouses Nocuenca vs. Atty. Bensi, A.C. No. 12609, Feb. 10, 2020)

Duties to clients 
- Every lawyer owes fidelity to the causes and concerns of his clients; he must be ever mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him by his clients; his duty to safeguard the clients' interests commences from his engagement as such, and lasts until his effective release by the clients; sometime in 2004, complainant engaged the services of respondent for the processing of the transfer and registration of a land title, and in connection therewith, paid the latter the amount of P244,865.00; however, twelve (12) years had passed until the filing of the administrative complaint without respondent having rendered the services he had assumed; such neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him by complainant constitutes flagrant violations of Canons 2, 17, 18 and Rule 18.03 of the CPR; it is settled that once a lawyer takes up the cause of his client, he is duty-bound to serve the latter with competence, and to attend to such client's cause with diligence, care, and devotion whether he accepts it for a fee or for free; a lawyer's neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him by his client constitutes inexcusable negligence for which he must be held administratively liable. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The relationship between a lawyer and a client is "imbued with utmost trust and confidence"; lawyers are expected to exercise the necessary diligence and competence in managing cases entrusted to them; they commit not only to review cases or give legal advice, but also to represent their clients to the best of their ability without need to be reminded by either the client or the court; when a lawyer agrees to act as a counsel, he guarantees that he will exercise that reasonable degree of care and skill demanded by the character of the business he undertakes to do, to protect the clients' interests and take all steps or do all acts necessary therefor; conversely, a lawyer's negligence in fulfilling his duties subjects him to disciplinary action; while such negligence or carelessness is incapable of exact formulation, the Court has consistently held that the lawyer's mere failure to perform the obligations due his client is per se a violation; the requirement and repercussions of non-submission of an appellant's brief are provided for under Rules 44 and 50 of the Revised Rules of Court; as a lawyer, respondent is presumed to know the procedural rules in appellate practice; this includes the rule that when the appellant fails to file the appeal brief within the prescribed period, the appeal shall be dismissed; here, respondent admitted to have intentionally not filed the appeal brief, albeit he gives two inconsistent reasons i.e. one, he was informed that the cases had been amicably settled and two, his supposed effort to contact his clients which proved futile aside from the fact that his clients failed to follow up with him; he was grossly negligent in his duty to file the required appeal brief, causing the appeal to be dismissed and his clients' to perpetually lose the chance to have the case reviewed and possibly to reverse the judgment against them; respondent is guilty of violation of Canon 18 and Rule 18.02 of the CPR; the fact that complainants' claim over the 2,507 square meter land is deemed lost forever due to respondent's failure to forthrightly perform his duty as complainants' counsel and for lack of any showing of empathy or remorse for the unfortunate incident that he, himself, had caused; penalty of suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months. (Sta. Maria, et al. vs. Atayde, Jr., A.C. No. 9197, Feb. 12, 2020)

Gross misconduct 
- The Attorney's Oath is clear that Atty. Plata must "not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid nor consent to the same." Section 20(c) and (g), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court also emphasize the relevant duties of Atty. Plata applicable to this case, to wit: SEC. 20. Duties of attorneys. - It is the duty of an attorney: x x x (c) To counsel or maintain such actions or proceedings only as appear to him to be just, and such defenses only as he believes to be honestly debatable under the law; x x x (g) Not to encourage either the commencement or the continuance of an action or proceedings, or delay any man's cause, from any corrupt motive or interest; the Court notes that Atty. Plata did not deny that he had filed several civil, criminal and administrative cases against the opposing parties and their counsels. Upon examination of the records, it becomes apparent that these suits are mere harassing tactics against Pagdanganan, his co-respondents and their counsel; The Court is mindful of Atty. Plata's duty to defend his client's cause with utmost zeal; however, professional rules, as above-quoted, impose limits on a lawyer's zeal and hedge it with necessary restrictions and qualifications; Atty. Plata's filing of several cases against the adverse parties and their counsel lays bare his intent to repress the opposing counsel from exerting utmost effort in protecting his clients' interest; the filing of several groundless suits and the reservation of filing another perjury suit in the future despite the pendency of another perjury case reveal Atty. Plata's gross indiscretion as a colleague in the legal profession, in blatant violation of his oath and duties as a lawyer; Atty. Plata's harassing tactics of filing multiple groundless and baseless suits are contrary to the Rules and Canons in the Code of Professional Responsibility (Canon 8, Rule 10.03, Rule 12.02, Rule 12.04) (Pagdanganan vs. Plata, A.C. No. 12701 [C.B.D. 12-3626], Feb. 26, 2020)

Practice of law 
- Respondent's admission to the Philippine Bar has long been held in abeyance due to the criminal cases pending against him before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City; per the rollo, it appears that all criminal charges against him has been dismissed except for the most recent one filed in 2019; the timing of the filing of this case, however, is highly suspect as it came just as the other criminal charges against respondent were dismissed on June 28, 2018, January 4, 2019, and October 15, 2019; thus, it can no longer be denied that the manifest intention of complainant in successively filing these criminal cases against respondent is to prevent him from taking the Lawyer's Oath and signing the Roll of Attorneys 
- the last two steps needed to be undertaken by respondent to become a full-fledged lawyer; the dismissal of all the other criminal charges against respondent, coupled with the various certifications of good moral character in his favor, is sufficient for the Court to conclude that respondent possesses the moral qualifications required of lawyers; though it is true that the practice of law is not a right but a privilege, the Court will not unjustifiably withhold this privilege from respondent, who has clearly shown that he is both intellectually and morally qualified to join the legal profession; and so, after almost six years of waiting, the Court finally grants respondent's prayer for admission to the Philippine Bar. (De Zuzuarregui vs. De Zuzuarregui, B.M. No. 2796, Feb. 11, 2020)

Violation of Lawyer's Oath and breach of ethics of the profession 
- The Court entertains no doubt that Atty. Viaje, through fraud, duress, and coercion, prevailed upon complainant to surrender her shares of stock in GRDC by signing a Voting Trust Agreement and making himself and two others stockholders and directors in the said corporation; the Court has held that, "when the integrity of a member of the bar is challenged, it is not enough that he[/she] denies the charges against him[/her]; he[/she] must meet the issue and overcome the evidence against him[/her]; he[/she] must show proof that he[/she] still maintains that degree of morality and integrity, which at all times is expected of him/her; Atty. Viaje wasted the opportunity given to rebut complainants' accusations. Instead of meeting them head on, he was evasive in his answers; Atty. Viaje violated his oath as a lawyer and breached the ethics of his profession; "[Lawyers] are expected at all times to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and refrain from any act or omission which might lessen the trust and confidence reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession"; Atty. Viaje failed to live up to the standards and demands required of him as a member of the Bar; Atty. Viaje is DISBARRED and his name ORDERED STRICKEN OFF from the Roll of Attorneys effective immediately without prejudice to the civil and criminal cases pending or to be filed against him. (Puno vs. Atty. Viaje, A.C. No. 12085, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### ATTORNEY'S FEES

Award of 
- Since Roxas was compelled to litigate to enforce his rights and protect his interests, he is entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10 percent ) of the total monetary award due him in accordance with Article 111 of the Labor Code and Article 2208 of the Civil Code. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### BILL OF RIGHTS

Right to due process of law 
- Due process, in its classic formulation, means that any person having interest to the thing in litigation, or the outcome of the judgment, must be notified and given an opportunity to defend that interest; conforming to the constitutional guarantee of due process of law is the principle that a person cannot be prejudiced by a ruling rendered in an action or proceeding in which he was not made a party; the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard or, as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of; in this case, even assuming that Pedro was an indispensable party, he cannot claim denial of due process for the simple reason that he had the opportunity to question the judgment of the DARAB-Region VIII. (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)

Right to speedy disposition of cases 
- Cagang v. Sandiganbayan clarified that in cases before the Office of the Ombudsman, the fact-finding investigation is not deemed included in the preliminary investigation for the purpose of determining the existence of inordinate delay, because the investigations are not yet adversarial proceedings against the accused; thus, in evaluating cases invoking the right to speedy disposition of cases, "a case is deemed to have commenced from the filing of the formal complaint and the subsequent conduct of the preliminary investigation"; the Ombudsman ought to provide a reasonable period based on: (1) its experience; (2) the number of the accused; (3) the complexity of the evidence; and (4) the issues involved; however, the burden of proving that there was violation of the right to speedy disposition lies with the defense; it must be able to show that the proceedings were prolonged longer than what is reasonably necessary; moreover, the defense must show that it exerted efforts to protect its constitutional rights; failure to timely raise the alleged violation of its right operates against the defendant because sleeping on the right indicates his or her acquiescence to the delay; the delay must not be attributable to the defense to conclude that there is a violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases; delaying tactics employed by the accused will be taken against him or her; this covers situations such as "failing to appear despite summons, filing needless motions against interlocutory actions, or requesting unnecessary postponements that will prevent courts or tribunals to properly adjudicate the case"; Cagang summarizes the clearer guide in resolving cases on right to speedy disposition of cases or right to speedy trial. (Republic vs. Sandiganbayan (Special Second Division), et al., G.R. 231144, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In determining the length of delay, Dansal v. Hernandez recognized that the period must include the investigation even before the trial commenced; in criminal prosecutions, rules on preliminary investigation under Rule 112, Section 3 of the Rules of Court come to play; Section 1 of R.A. 8493, otherwise known as the Speedy Trial Act, also laid down the time limit of 180 days for the entire trial; the Guidelines for Decongesting Holding Jails by Enforcing the Right of the Accused to Bail and to Speedy Trial likewise provide for strict time limits that must be observed, among other laws; in cases filed before quasi-judicial agencies, there is no law providing for the period to be observed in terms of disposition of the case; in cases before the Office of the Ombudsman, the Constitution only mandates it to act promptly on cases. (Id.)


- The right to speedy disposition of cases is constitutionally guaranteed under Article III, Section 16 of the Constitution; this right is different and distinct from the right to speedy trial, which is enshrined under Article III, Section 14(2); under the 1973 Constitution, the right to speedy disposition of cases was first crafted and integrated into our legal system; prior to this, the 1935 Constitution only carried the right to speedy trial, which may only be cited in criminal prosecutions; thus, the right to speedy to disposition of cases, which may be raised even before quasi-judicial and administrative bodies involving civil, criminal, and administrative cases, provides a broader scope of protection; the third constitutional provision mandating speedy dispensation of justice is found in Article VIII, Section 15, which provides for a period within which a case must be decided and resolved by courts; nevertheless, the right to speedy disposition of cases still embraces a greater scope because Article VIII, Section 15 only covers the period after the submission of cases; similar to the right to speedy trial, the right to speedy disposition of cases primarily seeks to prevent delay in the administration of justice. (Id.)


- The right to speedy disposition of cases is violated only when there is inordinate delay, such that the proceedings are "attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or when unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured, or when without cause or unjustifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to elapse without the party having his case tried"; inordinate delay was first introduced in Tatad v. Sandiganbayan; Tatad held that the determination of whether or not there is a violation of speedy disposition of cases applies on a case-to-case basis; thus, the concept of speedy disposition is relative; there is no hard-and-fast mathematical rule on the reckoning of time involved and facts peculiar to each case must be taken into account; this Court carved a standard test in resolving these cases; Martin v. Ver adopted the "balancing test" which provides four (4) factors as its guide in determining the existence of inordinate delay, namely: (1) length of delay; (2) reason for delay; (3) defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his or her right; and (4) prejudice caused to the defendant as a result of the delay; however, these factors must be taken into account together with the other circumstances of the case; furthermore, the totality of the facts must be weighed and evaluated. (Id.)


- This Court finds that there was no violation of private respondent's right to speedy disposition of cases; following the Cagang guidelines, it is clear that the prosecution bears the burden of proof; from the time the Complaint was filed on January 18, 2005, until the Resolution was finally approved by the Ombudsman on June 23, 2008, it took the prosecution three (3) and a half years to conclude the preliminary investigation; this is beyond the prescribed period for the determination of probable cause; the hearing must be concluded 15 days from the submission of the counter-affidavits and afterwards, the investigating officer must determine whether or not there is probable cause to formally charge the accused 10 days after the hearing; subsequently, the rules require that five (5) days after the resolution, it must be forwarded to the Ombudsman, who shall act upon the resolution within 10 days from receipt; here, the conduct of the preliminary investigation was clearly beyond the period prescribed by the rules; bearing the burden of proof, the prosecution must show that it followed the rules in the conduct of the preliminary investigation, that the complexity of the issues and volume of evidence caused the delay, and that there is no prejudice caused to the accused; first, petitioner showed that it followed the procedure leading to the resolution of the preliminary investigation; second, petitioner succinctly explained that the multiple respondents and numerous documents involved made the case more complex and difficult to resolve; third, this Court agrees with petitioner that the allegations of private respondent are insufficient to conclude that there was prejudice; a claim of prejudice must have a conclusive and factual basis; pure speculation and mere generalization will not work in favor of the accused and there must be an actual, specific, and real injury to his or her rights; prejudice cannot be established by "conjectural supplications of prejudice or by dubious invocations of constitutional rights"; private respondent failed to elaborate and specifically allege that the prejudice caused towards him by the prolonged proceedings are actual and real, and that the nature and degree of these problems were oppressive; fourth, private respondent contributed to the delay; private respondent moved twice for an extension to file his counter-affidavit, and before eventually filing, he filed another motion to consolidate the case with another complaint against him; his co-accused likewise filed motions for extension; fifth, while there is no precise mathematical reckoning of the delay, the Sandiganbayan erred in the computation of the period; while it took 10 years from the filing of the Complaint until the Information was filed before the Sandiganbayan, respondent Sandiganbayan failed to take into account that there was a pending petition for certiorari filed before this Court; thus, the delay was inevitable; lastly, private respondent is deemed to have waived his right; in the span of three (3) years of preliminary investigation, he never raised this contention and instead, the allowed the investigation to drag on; while the Constitution guarantees the right of the accused to speedy disposition of cases, this right is not a magical invocation which can be cunningly used by the accused for his or her advantage; this right is not a last line of remedy when accused find themselves at the losing end of the proceedings; the State's duty to prosecute cases is equally as important, and this cannot be disregarded at the whim of the accused, especially when it appears that the contention was raised as a mere afterthought; in any case, this Court finds that the period from the filing of the Complaint, to the conduct of the preliminary investigation, and up to the filing of the Information, was not attended or characterized by inordinate delay; there was nothing vexatious, capricious, and oppressive which would warrant the outright dismissal of the case. (Id.)

#### CAUSE OF ACTION

Elements 
- "A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another"; it has three constitutive elements: first, a legal right accruing to the plaintiff; second, a duty on the defendant's part to respect such right; and third, an act or omission by the defendant violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of defendant to the plaintiff; Tocoms bases its cause of action for damages upon Articles 19, 20, and 21 of the Civil Code, and its "constitutionally vested right to property and to peaceful, uninterrupted, and fair conduct of business"; according to Tocoms, the acts committed by PELI during and after the effectivity of the agreement are tainted with bad faith and malice in view of the significant investments made by the former during the effectivity of the Distribution Agreement and in the run-up to the expiration thereof in 2012.

Test in determining sufficiency 
- In determining the sufficiency of a cause of action, the test is, whether or not, admitting hypothetically the truth of the allegations of fact made in the complaint, the court may validly grant the relief prayed for in the complaint; as correctly pointed out during the deliberations of this case, if the foregoing allegations in Tocoms' complaint are hypothetically admitted, these acts constitute bad faith on the part of respondent PELI in the exercise of its rights under the Distributorship Agreement, in violation of Article 19, and as punished by Article 21; the court may validly award damages in favor of Tocoms as prayed for in its Complaint; while all the foregoing acts committed by PELI are justifiable under the terms of the Distributorship Agreement, the question of whether or not these acts were committed with malice or in bad faith – in light of the allegations in the Complaint – still remains disputed. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### CERTIORARI

Grave abuse of discretion 
- The Orders issued by the RTC judge constituted a valid exercise of her judicial authority and jurisdiction; mere error, if any, in the substantive discussion of an Order, neither provides nor furnishes sufficient grounds to sustain a certiorari proceeding before the Supreme Tribunal; certiorari being an extraordinary writ, will lie only where it is clearly shown that the lower body or tribunal had acted with grave abuse of discretion, or where the power is exercised in a grossly arbitrary and despotic manner; even thus assuming that Her Honor erred or made a mistake in finding that there was no probable cause to indict respondent for Libel, such mistake does not amount to a grave abuse of discretion or lack or excess of jurisdiction. (Domingo vs. Macapagal, G.R. 242577, Feb. 26, 2020)


- There is grave abuse of discretion when an act is: (1) done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence; or (2) executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, out of malice, ill will or personal bias; manifest disregard of the basic rules and procedures constitutes a grave abuse of discretion; here, Presiding Judge Xenos did not act without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in not approving the plea bargain of Sayre; there was a continuing objection on the part of the prosecution; the parties failed to arrive at a "mutually satisfactory disposition of the case" that may be submitted for the court's approval; the RTC correctly ordered the continuation of the proceedings because there was no mutual agreement to plea bargain. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)

Petition for 
- In dismissing the Complaint and denying the Motion for Reconsideration, the Ombudsman relied on the Ombudsman Act of 1989, cited relevant jurisprudence, and squarely applied the foregoing to the facts of the case at hand; this negates Dormido's allegation that grave abuse of discretion might have attended the Ombudsman's conclusions; whether these determinations by the Ombudsman were correct or wrong is not remediable by certiorari; whimsicality in the issuance of a decision, not accuracy, is the core of certiorari proceedings; an unfavorable evaluation of the evidence presented by a party will not be inquired into via certiorari unless it is shown that it was done in an arbitrary manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal enmity. (Dormido vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 198241, Feb. 24, 2020)


- It was held in St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC that the decision of the NLRC may be reviewed by the CA through a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65; but because certiorari is not the same as an appeal, it is not a means to review the entire decision of the NLRC for reversible errors on questions of fact and law; apparently limiting itself to the arguments contained in the certiorari petition, the CA resolved only the issue of whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in admitting Dela Cruz's appeal; the limits of the review under Rule 65 affect the Court's review under Rule 45 assailing the CA's ruling in cases involving alleged grave abuse of discretion by the NLRC; given that a review under Rule 45 is limited only to questions of law, the question of law that must be resolved is whether the CA correctly ruled on the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC; here, the task of the Court is to determine whether the CA was correct in holding that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding that Dela Cruz seasonably filed her appeal; no whim or caprice on the part of the NLRC when it relied on Dela Cruz's allegation as contained in her Memorandum of Appeal that she received the Labor Arbiter's Decision, especially when there was no contrary proof presented by petitioners; the CA correctly denied the certiorari petition on this ground. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Petitioner did not present any explanation for failing to timely file a petition under Rule 45 and filing instead a petition under Rule 65; the remedy of certiorari under Rule 65, as a general rule, cannot be availed of as a substitute for the lost remedy of an ordinary appeal, including that under Rule 45. (Fernandez vs. Court of Appeals, Twenty-Third Division, Cagayan de Oro City, et al., G.R. 233460, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court agrees with the ruling of the RTC that the disputed acts of the MTC in denying admissibility to the subject ink cartridges as part of the prosecution's evidence, its appreciation of the entirety of evidence presented by both parties to the case, and its subsequent finding that the prosecution failed to prove the crime charged, are assailable as errors of judgment and are not reviewable by the extraordinary remedy of certiorari; the Court finds no error in the ruling of the RTC that petitioner was not able to establish its allegation of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the MTC; where a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court alleges grave abuse of discretion, the petitioner should establish that the respondent court or tribunal acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of its jurisdiction as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction; this Court has explained that: The term "grave abuse of discretion" has a specific meaning; an act of a court or tribunal can only be considered as with grave abuse of discretion when such act is done in a "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction"; the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an "evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility"; the use of a petition for certiorari is restricted only to "truly extraordinary cases wherein the act of the lower court or quasi-judicial body is wholly void"; the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 can only strike an act down for having been done with grave abuse of discretion if the petitioner could manifestly show that such act was patent and gross; as found by the RTC, there was no hint of whimsicality, nor of gross and patent abuse of discretion as would amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law on the part of the MTC; if at all, the mistake committed by the MTC is only an error of judgment and not of jurisdiction, which would have amounted to a grave abuse of discretion. (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The documents required to be attached in a petition for certiorari that is filed before the CA, such as the instant case, are found under Section 3, Rule 46 and Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court; as explained in Republic v. Carmel Devt. Inc., Rule 46 primarily governs original actions for certiorari filed in the CA, but Rule 65 generally serves to supplement it; specifically, Section 2, Rule 46 expressly states that Rule 46 shall apply to original actions for certiorari, and that except as otherwise provided in Rule 46, the actions for certiorari shall be governed by Rule 65; as such, Rules 46 and 65 co-exist with each other and should be construed so as to give effect to every provision of both rules; in Air Philippines Corp. v. Zamora, the Court explained that the foregoing rules require two sets of documents to be attached to the petition: (1) a duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof; and (2) copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto; here, the copy of the RTC Decision dated July 21, 2016 with the notation "ORIGINAL SIGNED" attached to the petition for certiorari was not a duplicate copy; thus not compliant with the requirement under Section 3, Rule 46 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65; however, after the denial of his petition for certiorari, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration with a certified true copy of the RTC Decision dated July 21, 2016; hence, the Court considers it as substantial compliance with the requirement under Section 3, Rule 46 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65; As to petitioner's purported failure to attach copies of other pertinent pleadings/documents and other relevant portions of the records, the CA should not have been too rigid in applying the rules to dismiss the petition based on mere technicalities; applying our pronouncements in Jaro v. Court of Appeals and Air Philippines Corp. v Zamora, the CA should have considered petitioner's submissions attached to the motion for reconsideration as substantial compliance to the formal requirements under Section 1 of Rule 65. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The very basic prerequisite of a petition for certiorari is to allege the acts constituting grave abuse purportedly committed by the public officer, tribunal, or court; Dormido aims to overturn the factual findings and legal conclusions of the Ombudsman; she sums up the arguments presented in her Petition for Certiorari; the arguments do not allege errors of jurisdiction but errors of judgment; Dormido complains that Adobo and De la Peña, in the exercise of their official duties, gave the spouses Manahan an unwarranted benefit, and that despite prima facie showing of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, the Ombudsman dismissed her Complaint; such accusations against respondents, without anything more, cannot be considered as grave abuse of discretion amounting to an evasion of a positive duty; these accusation only express mere disagreement with the Ombudsman's judgment, which does not proceed from grave abuse of discretion; the Petition contained no allegations of the Ombudsman's supposed acts of grave abuse of discretion adequate to reverse the latter's pronouncements, and indict respondents instead for the charges of graft and corruption; there is no clear showing of arbitrariness on the part of the Ombudsman in dismissing Dormido's Complaint; grave abuse of discretion could have been held against the Ombudsman had it declared in its assailed Order that there was reasonable ground to indict respondents for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 as so desired by Dormido, when facts and jurisprudence prevailing at the time of the issuance of Deed of Conveyance No. V-200022 clearly instructed otherwise; the term grave abuse of discretion has, ironically, fallen victim to procedural abuse; as a last-ditch remedy to turn the odds in their favor, vengeful litigants resort to indiscriminate imputation of the term to the public officer that issued a verdict adverse to them, in manifest indifference to the soundness of its exercise or the frailty of their cause; Rules must not be stretched for personal retribution, or even if such purpose be pursued, it must have a solid grounding in fact and law. (Dormido vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 198241, Feb. 24, 2020)


- While petitioners raise errors of judgement that fall outside the purview of the remedy sought, procedural rules may be relaxed in view of the ultimate goal of rendering substantive justice; Microsoft Corp. v. Best Deal Computer Center teaches that a petition for certiorari corrects only errors of jurisdiction, and cannot correct errors of judgment; as such, a Rule 65 petition "must raise not errors of judgment but the acts and circumstances showing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction"; in Punongbayan-Visitacion, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed for being an improper remedy; upon reaching this Court, it was held that a petition for certiorari may be treated as an appeal if the "interest of substantial justice warrants the relaxation of the rules"; further, in Curammeng v. People, procedural rules were relaxed "where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition"; likewise, an argument raised for the first time on appeal may still be considered in order to recognize "jurisprudential developments since the RTC decision and the needs for substantial justice"; Olivarez was decided in 2014, and clarified relevant points of law that may not have been apparent to the lower courts at the time; thus, petitioners' argument regarding "reasonable rentals" may be duly considered; while Punongbayan-Visitacion stressed the importance of timeliness in filing a petition for certiorari, even compliance with prescriptive periods may be relaxed when "the application of the Rule would tend to frustrate rather than promote justice"; thus, the merits of the petition and the need to accord substantial justice should outweigh a petition's nomenclature and the parties' procedural lapses. (Spouses Godinez vs. Spouses Norman, G.R. 225449, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CIVIL OR DEATH INDEMNITY

Grant of 
- Civil or death indemnity is mandatory and granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime; initially fixed by the Civil Code at P3,000.00, the amount of the indemnity is currently fixed at P50,000.00. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### CIVIL REGISTER

Certificate of Live Birth 
- Generally, the entries recorded in the birth certificate: (1) the date and hour of birth; (2) the sex and nationality of the infant; (3) the names, citizens, and religion of parents; (4) the civil status of parents; and (5) the place where the infant was born, all correspond to facts existing at the time of birth as argued by the Republic; however, reading Article 407 of the Civil Code in conjunction with Article 412 of the Civil Code, even acts or events that occurred after birth may be recorded in the certificate of live birth; the reason is that Article 412 of the Civil Code uses the word "changed," which implies the occurrence of an event subsequent to birth may be recorded in the civil register; that an event occurring after birth may be recorded in the civil register was pronounced in Co v. The Civil Register, a case cited by Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas in support of their Petition before the trial court; to prohibit the annotation of events subsequent to birth in the certificate of live birth is to deny a person the right to form his or her own identity; more than a "historical record of the facts as they existed at the time of birth," the birth certificate is an instrument of individuation. (Republic, Represented by the Special Committee on Naturalization (SCN) vs. Chia Lao, et al., G.R. 205218, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### CIVIL SERVICE LAW AND ITS IMPLEMENTING RULES ON ADMINISTRATIVE CASES

Length of service 
- Length of service should be taken against Tabasa, coupled with the fact that this is already his second offense; length of service is not a magic word that would automatically be considered as a mitigating circumstance in favor of the party invoking it; length of service is an alternative circumstance: it could either be a mitigating or aggravating circumstance depending on the factual milieu of each case; Tabasa's length of service cannot be considered as a mitigating circumstance since it is the number of years in the service that seemingly gave him the impression that he could do away with his teasing and offensive humor to the detriment of his co-workers; where a government employee concerned takes advantage of his long years of service and position in public office, length of service may not be considered in lowering the penalty. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)

Simple misconduct 
- Under the Civil Service Law and its implementing rules on administrative cases, the penalty for the second offense of simple misconduct is dismissal from the service; thus, as provided by law, there is no penalty that should be imposed on Tabasa other than the penalty of dismissal; under the circumstances, his dismissal is warranted; his years of service should have impelled him to set a good example to his co-employees and other civil servants instead of flagrantly and shamelessly violating the law and undermining the professionalism and integrity required from public servants; Tabasa should be reminded that a public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of professionalism, honesty and integrity for no less than the Constitution mandates that a public office is a public trust and public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives; these principles should be taken as working standards by all in the public service. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CLERKS OF COURT

Duties 
- Among all those duties entrusted to a Clerk of Court is the safekeeping of court funds; emphasized in Re: Report on the Financial Audit Conducted at the Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan, to wit: Clerks of Court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties, and premises; they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard, and physical plant manager thereof; it is the duty of the Clerks of Court to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities; they are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts; it is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds; Clerks of Court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice; an unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanctions and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Salunoy, Court Stenographer, A.M. No. P-07-2354, Feb. 4, 2020)


- As laudably depicted in The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, a clerk of court is indispensable in any judicial system, to wit: A Judge alone cannot make the Court function as it should; in the over-all scheme of judicial business, many non-judicial concerns, intricately and inseparably interwoven with the trial and adjudication of cases, must perforce be performed by other individuals that make up the team that complements the Court; of these individuals, the Clerk of Court eclipses the others in function, responsibilities, importance and prestige; the Clerk of Court has general administrative supervision over all the personnel of the Court; as regards the Court's funds and revenues, records, properties and premises, said officer is the custodian; the nature of the work and of the office mandates that the Clerk of Court be an individual of competence, honesty, and integrity. (Id.)


- Barcelona stated that she lacked the necessary training and experience in maintaining legal records and safely keeping the physical evidence in the custody of the court; her averments bare Atty. Toledo's carelessness in supervising the activities of his subordinates especially the court personnel to whom his administrative function was merely delegated; he relied entirely on Barcelona and passed to her all the responsibilities of an evidence custodian without ensuring that she possesses the skill set to effectively perform custodial duties; as the Branch Clerk of Court, he remains responsible for the shortcomings of his subordinate. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)


- The Manual for Clerks of Court and the Rules of Court define the role of a clerk of court in the administration of justice; Section E(2), paragraph 2.2.3, Chapter VI of the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court reads: All exhibits used as evidence and turned over to the court and before the easels involving such evidence shall have been terminated shall be under the custody and safekeeping of the Clerk of Court; Section 7 of Rule 136 of the Rules of Court also provides: SEC. 7. Safekeeping of property. 
- The clerk shall safely keep all records, papers, files, exhibits and public property committed to his charge, including the library of the court, and the seals and furniture belonging to his office; primary duty of safekeeping all the records and pieces of evidence submitted to the court in cases pending before it including the properties furnished to his office; this obligation extends to ensuring that the records and exhibits in each case are complete and accounted for, and continues even after the termination of the case as long as the same have yet to be disposed or destructed in accordance with the existing rules; it is the clerk of court who shall assume liability for any loss, shortage, damage or destruction of court records, exhibits and properties; Atty. Toledo miserably failed to establish a systematic and efficient documentation and record management in Branch 259 of the RTC of Parañaque City. (Id.)

Insubordination 
- Insubordination is defined as a refusal to obey some order, which a superior officer is entitled to give and have obeyed; the term imports an unwillingness to submit to authority and refusal to perform official duty; here, Clerk of Court Balisnomo was ordered by his superior Judge Espinosa to issue a writ of preliminary injunction in a case pending in their sala; Balisnomo, however, refused to follow the directive, insisting that pursuant to the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, he is only allowed to issue writs of execution and no other; on this score, Balisnomo overlooked the command under Chapter 7 that clerks of court should also "perform duties as may be assigned to him"; when Judge Espinosa ordered his Clerk of Court in the person of Balisnomo to issue a writ other than a writ of execution, Judge Espinosa was assigning an additional duty which Balisnomo ought to have obeyed; when Balisnomo deliberately disobeyed Judge Espinosa's orders, he committed an act of insubordination; Section 50 (D) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service classifies insubordination as a less grave offense punishable by suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense; and dismissal from service for the second offense; under Sections 48 and 49 of the same rules, in the determination of the penalties to be imposed, mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances attendant to the commission of the offense shall be considered; here, the penalty for insubordination is suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months; there being an aggravating circumstance of previous administrative liability i.e. found guilty of simple misconduct in A.M. No. P-16-3607, sans any offsetting mitigating circumstance, the Court deems it proper to impose on Balisnomo the maximum penalty of suspension for six (6) months without pay, with stern warning. (Espinosa vs. Balisnomo, Clerk of Court IV, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Sipalay, Negros Occidental, A.M. No. P-20-4039 [Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 18-4840-P], Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY (CPR)

Canon 8 and Canon 11 
- The Court concurs with the findings of Commissioner Mamon that the language contained in Atty. Misa's counter-affidavit, making reference to the personal behavior and circumstances of Roselyn run afoul to the precepts of the Code of Professional Responsibility; in Gimeno v. Zaide, it was held that the prohibition on the use of intemperate, offensive, and abusive language in a lawyer's professional dealings, whether with the courts, his clients, or any other person, is based on the following canons and rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility: Canon 8 – A lawyer shall conduct himself with courtesy, fairness and candor toward his professional colleagues, and shall avoid harassing tactics against opposing counsel; Rule 8.01 – A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive or otherwise improper; Canon 11 – A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others; Rule 11.03 – A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the Courts; Roselyn was not even a party to the subject criminal case under investigation by Asst. Prosecutor Melanio E. Cordillo, Jr.; the statements made in the counter-affidavit that Roselyn was a known drug addict, a fraud, and making insinuation that her marriage was a "fixed marriage" were pointless and uncalled for, and thus only show that the clear intention of Atty. Misa was to humiliate or insult Roselyn; Atty. Misa violated the canons and rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility for his use of derogatory and defamatory language in his affidavit; "though a lawyer's language may be forceful and emphatic, it should always be dignified and respectful, befitting the dignity of the legal profession; the use of intemperate language and unkind ascriptions has no place in the dignity of judicial forum." (Parks vs. Atty. Misa, Jr., A.C. No. 11639, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### COMMON CARRIERS

Failure to register as a public vehicle or a common carrier 
- Article 1732 of the Civil Code defines common carriers as persons, corporations, firms or associations engaged in the business of carrying or transporting passengers or goods or both, by land, water, or air, for compensation, offering their services to the public; the Land Transportation and Traffic Code distinguished the classification of vehicles; the requirement for vehicles for hire to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was emphasized in LTFRB Memorandum Circular Number 98-027; the Heirs of Catalina established through preponderance of evidence that, at the time of the incident, the vehicle was being used as a truck for hire without securing the necessary franchise from the LTFRB; ES Trucking engaged in a truck for hire business, offering their vehicles to transport the cargo of its customers; Ruste admitted that they filed an application to have the vehicle included in their Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) yet their application was never granted; this is inconsistent with his own claim that ES Trucking does not need to register with the LTFRB because it is not a common carrier but a private company; ES Trucking cannot be excused simply because it is not registered with the LTFRB and it is a private company; as an entity engaged in the truck for hire business, it should have complied with the requirements of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code and the issuances of the LTFRB; despite being registered as a private vehicle, the actual use of the vehicle and the clientele to whom ES Trucking offers its services remain controlling; the failure to register the vehicle as a public vehicle or a common carrier does not negate the true nature of the vehicle. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### COMPLAINT OR INFORMATION

Dismissal of 
- At the outset, the RTC based its order of dismissal on Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court; the provision contemplates certain instances where the complaint may be dismissed due to the plaintiff's fault: (1) if he or she fails to appear during a scheduled hearing, especially on the date for the presentation of his or her evidence in chief; (2) if he or she fails to prosecute his or her action for an unreasonable length of time; (3) if he or she fails to comply with the rules; or (4) if he or she fails to comply with any order of the court; thus, failure on the part of the plaintiff, without any justifiable cause, to comply with any order of the court may result in the dismissal of the complaint either motu proprio or on motion by the defendant. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)

Filing of 
- In Crespo v. Mogul, the Supreme Court held that once a complaint or information is already filed in court, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court; it is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it; thus, when a motion to dismiss the case is filed by the public prosecutor, it should be addressed to the court who has the option to grant or deny the same; the court should be mindful not to infringe on the substantial rights of the accused or the right of the People to due process of law; in Santos v. Orda, Jr., this Court emphasized that the above rule likewise applies to a motion to withdraw Information or to dismiss the case filed before the court, like in the case at bar, even before or after arraignment of the accused; the grant or denial of the same is left to the trial court's exclusive judicial discretion; hence, it should not merely rely on the findings of the public prosecutor or the Secretary of Justice that no crime was committed or that the evidence in the possession of the public prosecutor is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction of the accused; instead, the trial court has to make its own independent assessment of the merits of the case as well as the evidence of the prosecution. (Social Security System vs. Seno, Jr., et al., G.R. 183478, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### COMPLEX CRIMES

Commission of 
- The final amendment to the Informations charged accused-appellants of the complex crime of arbitrary detention with murder; however, evidence failed to show that the incidents made out a case of complex crime under Article 48 of the RPC; first, the single act of accused-appellants did not constitute two or more grave or less grave felonies; second, arbitrary detention was not used as a necessary means to commit murder; in various cases such as People of the Philippines v. Li Wai Cheung and People of the Philippines v. Araneta, the Court convicted the accused for the separate crimes even if they were indicted of a complex crime in the Information because it was improper for the prosecutor to have charged them of a complex crime as the offenses were separate and distinct from each other and cannot be complexed; in examining the events that transpired prior to the killing of the three, it was not proved that their arbitrary detention was used as a means of killing them; when the three were abducted and placed in the custody of accused-appellants, the felony of arbitrary detention had already been consummated; thereafter, when they were boxed, kicked, pistol-whipped and ultimately shot at a close range while being handcuffed and without means to defend themselves, another separate crime of murder was committed. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002 (R.A. 9165)

Chain of custody rule 
- Admittedly, strict compliance with the requirements of law may not always be possible and the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of R.A. 9165 does not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items void, this has always been with the caveat that the prosecution still needs to satisfactorily prove that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved; "it is well-settled that the procedure in Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects"; any breach in the procedure laid down in our laws has the effect of compromising the integrity and evidentiary value of the very corpus delicti of the case and thereby militates against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt against the accused. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- After the marking and inventory of the seized items, City Jail Warden Superintendent Enriquez signed the referral letter to the PDEA Laboratory Service Unit; although Superintendent Enriquez was not presented in court, this does not necessarily cast doubt on the integrity of the seized items; for not all people who came into contact with the seized drugs are required to testify in court; there is nothing in the law or in any rule implementing the same which imposes such requirement; of utmost importance is the fact that the chain of custody of the seized drug was clearly shown to have remained unbroken. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)


- As culled from the records and highlighted by the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses themselves, only one of the required witnesses was present during the inventory stage - the barangay captain of Ungot; the failure of the police officers to provide a reasonable excuse or justification for the absence of the other witnesses clearly magnified the lack of concrete effort on their part to comply with the requirements of Section 21; the absence of these witnesses constitutes a substantial gap in the chain of custody and raises doubts on the integrity and evidentiary value of the items that were allegedly seized from the petitioner; it militates against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the law deserves faithful compliance, especially by the police officers who ought to have known the proper procedure in the seizure and handling of the confiscated items, especially since the small volume of the suspected drugs made it easier for the items to be corrupted or tampered with; it is only for justifiable and unavoidable grounds that deviations from the required procedure is excused; the Court finds the errors committed by the apprehending team as sufficient to cast serious doubts on the guilt of the petitioner; absent faithful compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 which is primarily intended to, first, preserve the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items in drugs cases, and second, to safeguard accused persons from unfounded and unjust convictions, an acquittal becomes the proper recourse. (Tolentino vs. People, G.R. 227217, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Chain of custody means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction; such record of movements and custody of the seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition; Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 requires the apprehending team, after seizure and confiscation, to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the same in the presence of (1) the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel; (2) a representative from the media and (3) the DOJ; and (4) any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; a plain reading of the law shows that it applies as long as there has been a seizure and confiscation of drugs; nothing in the statutory provision states that it is only applicable when there is a warrantless seizure in a buy-bust operation; thus, it should be applied in every situation when an apprehending team seizes and confiscates drugs from an accused, whether through a buy-bust operation or through a search warrant. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In prosecution of drug-related cases, the State bears not only the burden of proving these elements, but also of proving the corpus delicti or the body of the crime; the dangerous drug itself is the very corpus delicti of the violation of the law; therefore, compliance with the chain of custody rule is crucial; chain of custody means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction; the rule is imperative, as it is essential that the prohibited drug confiscated or recovered from the suspect is the very same substance offered in court as exhibit; and that the identity of said drug is established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt; thus, strict compliance with the procedures laid down under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is required to ensure that rights are safeguarded; it requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed immediately after seizure or confiscation; and (2) that the physical inventory and photographing must be done in the presence of (a) the accused or his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the Department of Justice, all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In the prosecution of drugs cases, the procedural safeguards that are embodied in Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. 10640, are material, as their compliance affects the corpus delicti which is the dangerous drug itself and warrants the identity and integrity of the substances and other evidence that are seized by the apprehending officers; the amendment that was introduced by R.A. 10640 in Section 21 prescribes a physical inventory and photograph of the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, plus two other witnesses, particularly, (1) an elected public official, and (2) a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media, who shall sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; proponents of the amendment recognized that the strict implementation of the original Section 21 of R.A. 9165 could be impracticable for the law enforcers' compliance, and that the stringent requirements could unduly hamper their activities towards drug eradication; the amendment then substantially included the saving clause that was actually already in the IRR of the former Section 21, indicating that non-compliance with the law's requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid seizures and custody over confiscated items; a failure to fully satisfy the requirements under Section 21 must be strictly premised on "justifiable grounds"; the primary rule that commands a satisfaction of the instructions prescribed by the statute stands; the value of the rule is significant; its non-compliance has serious effects and is fatal to the prosecution's case. (Tolentino vs. People, G.R. 227217, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Links that the prosecution must prove to establish chain of custody: first, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court; as a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of the exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be; it would thus include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was seized to the time it is offered in court as evidence, such that every person who handled the same would admit how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain; the prosecution's failure to present evidence showing the manner in which the illegal drug subject of this case was handled, stored and safeguarded pending its presentation in court is fatal to its case. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 was originally envisioned by the legislature to serve as a protection for the accused from malicious imputations of guilt by abusive police officers; the illegal drugs being the corpus delicti, it is essential for the prosecution to prove and show to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the illegal drugs presented to it as evidence of the crime are indeed the illegal drugs seized from the accused; by its very nature, Sec. 21 demands strict compliance; compliance cannot give way to a facsimile; otherwise, the purpose of guarding against tampering, substitution, and planting of evidence is defeated; proof that strict compliance is imperative is how jurisprudence disapproves of the approximation of compliance; the ultimate purpose of Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 is to prevent the tampering, alteration, and substitution of the seized drugs, which are not readily identifiable, and to serve as a protection against abusive police officers; the evil sought to be prevented by Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 exists both in the implementation of a search warrant and in the conduct of a buy-bust operation; in both cases, the law requires that the identity and integrity of the confiscated items be maintained so as to prevent the malicious practice of police officers in tampering, altering, and substituting the said items; thus, the chain of custody rule under Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165, including the mandatory witnesses during the physical inventory and taking of photographs of the seized drugs, must be applied when there is a confiscation of purported drugs in the implementation of a search warrant. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 outlines the procedure that police officers must follow in handling the confiscated drugs in order to ensure that their integrity and evidentiary value are preserved; the law requires that the inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if prior to the amendment of R.A. 9165 by R.A. 10640, "a representative from the media and the DOJ, and any elected public official"; or (b) if after the amendment of R.A. 9165 by R.A. 10640, "an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media." (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The fourth link in the chain of custody refers to the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court; there was a slight discrepancy in the weight of the seized item stated in Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DD016-092 and the actual weight during ocular inspection; per Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DD016-092, the net weight of the seized item was 735.8 grams; during the ocular inspection, however, the weight increased to 747.8 grams or an increase of twelve (12) grams; in People v. Aneslag, et al., the Court found no cause to acquit the accused by reason alone of the variance in the weight of the shabu as alleged in the information (240 grams) on one hand, and as determined by the forensic chemist (210 grams) on the other; the Court noted that the variance may be explained by the following circumstances: (1) the subject shabu packs were twice tested by two (2) different forensic chemists in order to expedite the proceedings per order of the trial court so that representative samples of the shabu were taken from the aforesaid packs by the first forensic chemist (P/Sr. Insp. Mag-abo) which could have affected the total weight as subsequently determined by the second forensic chemist (P/Sr. Insp. Bernido); and (2) P/Sr. Insp. Bernido testified that when she weighed each pack of shabu, the same was done without the packaging material thereof which could have, likewise, affected the total weight of the shabu. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Under the law, a physical inventory and photograph of the items that were purportedly seized from the accused should have been made at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable; the entire procedure must likewise be made in the presence of the accused or his representative or counsel and three witnesses, namely: (1) an elected public official; (2) a representative from the DOJ; AND (3) a representative from the media; these individuals shall then be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (Tolentino vs. People, G.R. 227217, Feb. 12, 2020)

Illegal possession of dangerous drugs 
- Aside from recognizing the procedural lapses and providing a justifiable ground for the noncompliance, it is also required that the prosecution establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved in order to substantially comply with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165; here, it is evident that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were not preserved; there was no evidence presented on how the seized items were secured upon confiscation; it is not even clear who safeguarded the seized items from the time of confiscation up to its transfer to the investigating officer and until it reached the laboratory for examination; due to the prosecution's failure to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti were preserved, petitioner cannot be convicted of the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- For a successful prosecution of an offense for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following elements: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug; this crime is mala prohibita, as such, criminal intent is not an essential element; the prosecution, however, must prove that the accused had the intent to possess (animus possidendi). (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

Illegal sale and illegal possession of prohibited drugs 
- Fulgado stands charged with selling 0.02 gram of shabu and possessing 0.02 gram of shabu; for the successful prosecution of illegal sale of prohibited drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the following elements must be established beyond reasonable doubt, to wit: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; on the other hand, in order to secure conviction for illegal possession of prohibited drugs under Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 the prosecution must prove: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug; in both cases, the existence of the drug – being the corpus delicti of the crimes – must be clearly established by the prosecution; corollarily, the prosecution has the burden of proving that there was no interruption in the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs, from the moment the drugs were seized up to their presentation in court. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)

Illegal sale of dangerous drugs 
- In actions involving the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following elements: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; it is equally essential for a conviction that the drug subject of the sale be presented in court and its identity established with moral certainty through an unbroken chain of custody over it; the prosecution must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the dangerous drug from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the corpus delicti. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In order to convict a person charged with the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the prosecution is required to prove the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In order to sustain a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the law demands the establishment of the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor; what is important is that the sale transaction of drugs actually took place and that the object of the transaction is properly presented as evidence in court and is shown to be the same drugs seized from the accused. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

Non-compliance with the chain of custody rule 
- As field conditions vary and strict compliance with the rule may not always be possible, Section 21 of the IRR of R.A. 9165 provides a saving clause; noncompliance with the requirements of Section 21 will not automatically render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items, so long as: 1) there are justifiable grounds therefor, and 2) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team; failure to show these two conditions renders void and invalid the seizure of and custody of the seized illegal drugs; here, the inventory and taking of photographs of the seized illegal drug were witnessed by accused-appellants and Barangay Kagawad Ayson; there were no representatives from the media and the DOJ present at the time; since this is a deviation from the requirements of Section 21, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to provide justifiable reasons in order for the saving clause to apply; the prosecution failed to recognize its procedural lapse and provided no such explanation whatsoever other than that the police officers "cannot avail" of the presence of the required witnesses; these reasons must be proven as a fact because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist; not only did the prosecution fail to provide justifiable reasons for the absence of the required witnesses during the inventory and taking of photographs of the evidence, it also failed to show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item were properly preserved. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Here, the physical inventory and photograph of the seized item were not done at the place of the arrest but only at the police station; there was no showing by the prosecution that these were done due to extraordinary circumstances that would threaten the safety and security of the apprehending officers and/or the witnesses required by law or of the items seized; moreover, the absence of the witnesses required by law – an elected public official, representative of the DOJ and the media 
- to witness the physical inventory and photograph of the seized items is glaring; their signatures do not appear in the Inventory Receipt; in People v. Vicente Sipin: The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for noncompliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended; it has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law; its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence; the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items; strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is miniscule. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The Court is well aware that a perfect chain of custody is almost always impossible to achieve and so it has previously ruled that minor lapses or deviations from the prescribed procedure are excused so long as it can be shown by the prosecution that the arresting officers put in their best effort to comply with the same and the justifiable ground for non-compliance is proven as a fact; in the recent case of People of the Philippines v. Lim, the Court reiterated that testimonies of the prosecution witnesses must establish in detail that earnest effort to coordinate with and secure the presence of the required witnesses was made; in addition, it pointed out that given the increasing number of poorly built up drug-related cases in the courts' docket, Section 1 (A.1.10) of the Chain of Custody IRR should be enforced as a mandatory policy. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)


- The police officers in this case committed several violations of Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165; first, the required witnesses under Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 were not present; second, the seized items were not photographed by the police officers; the records are bereft of any photographs of the said items; third, neither can the prosecution apply the saving clause under Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165; the prosecution failed to give any justifiable ground for the noncompliance with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

Procedural safeguards in Section 21 
- In the prosecution of drugs cases, the procedural safeguards that are embodied in Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. No.10640, are material as their compliance affects the corpus delicti which is the dangerous drug itself and warrants the identity and integrity of the substances and other evidence that are seized by the apprehending officers; the amendment that was introduced by R.A. 10640 in Section 21 prescribes a physical inventory and photograph of the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, plus two other witnesses, particularly: (1) an elected public official, and (2) a representative of the National Prosecution Service (Department of Justice) or the media, who shall sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; proponents of the amendment recognized that the strict implementation of the original Section 21 of R.A. 9165 could be impracticable for the law enforcers' compliance, and that the stringent requirements could unduly hamper their activities towards drug eradication; the amendment then substantially included the saving clause that was actually already in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the former Section 21, indicating that non-compliance with the law's requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/ team, shall not render void and invalid seizures and custody over confiscated items. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)


- Since the offense subject of this appeal was committed before the amendment introduced by R.A. 10640, the old provisions of Section 21 and its IRR should apply; under the law, a physical inventory and photograph of the items that were purportedly seized from the accused should have been made at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable; the entire procedure must, likewise, be made in the presence of the accused or his representative or counsel and three witnesses, namely: (1) an elected public official; (2) a representative from the DOJ; and (3) a representative from the media; these individuals shall then be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; here, as culled from the records and highlighted by the testimonies of the police officers themselves, none of the required witnesses was present during the inventory stage; neither was it shown nor alleged by the police officers that earnest efforts were made to secure the attendance of these witnesses. (Id.)

Saving clause 
- Sec. 21 and its IRR provide for a saving clause in case of noncompliance with the chain of custody rule; this saving clause applies only (1) where the prosecution recognized the procedural lapses, and thereafter explained the cited justifiable grounds, and (2) when the prosecution established that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized had been preserved; the prosecution, thus, loses the benefit of invoking the presumption of regularity and bears the burden of proving – with moral certainty – that the illegal drug presented in court is the same drug that was confiscated from the accused during his arrest; again, this saving clause does not distinguish between cases with a search warrant and a buy-bust operation; whether drugs were seized in a buy-bust operation or in the implementation of the search warrant, the prosecution can invoke the saving clause provided that there is justifiable reason for noncompliance with the procedural lapses and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs are established. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

Seizure and marking 
- The first link in the chain of custody refers to the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officers; the marking of the seized drug is crucial in establishing an unbroken chain of custody because succeeding handlers of the dangerous drugs or related items will use the marking as reference; it serves to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized until disposal at the end of the criminal proceedings, thus preventing switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence; in other words, the immediate marking is indispensable in the preservation of the seized items' integrity and evidentiary value; JO2 Briones did the marking and inventory of the seized items in the Manila City Jail where Tulipat got arrested; the light violet bag was marked "ACD/4/28/16," the blue sando bag "ACB/1/4-28-16" and the self-sealing transparent bag "ACB-2/4-28-16"; on the other hand, JO3 Rodzon Antonio photographed these items. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

Venue of physical inventory and taking of photographs of the seized drugs —The only recognizable difference between seizure and confiscation of drugs pursuant to a search warrant and a buy-bust operation is the venue of the physical inventory and taking of photographs of the said drugs; in People v. Lazaro, the Court explained that the venue of physical inventory is not limited to the place of apprehension; the venues of the physical inventory and photography of the seized items differ and depend on whether the seizure was made by virtue of a search warrant or through a warrantless seizure such as a buy-bust operation; when the drugs are seized pursuant to a search warrant, then the physical inventory and taking of photographs shall be conducted at the place where the said search warrant was served; in contrast, when the drugs are seized pursuant to a buy-bust operation or a warrantless seizure, then these can be conducted at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending team; other than that, there is no other difference between seizure and confiscation of drugs with a search warrant and without it (such as a buy-bust operation); consistent with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165, its IRR does not suspend the application of the chain of custody rule simply because the drugs were seized pursuant to a search warrant; thus, the witnesses under the law are required to be present. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

Witnesses requirement 
- Earnest effort to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses must be proven; People v. Ramos requires: It is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not per se render the confiscated items inadmissible; however, a justifiable reason for such failure or a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 must be adduced; the prosecution miserably failed to explain why the police officers did not secure the presence of an elected public official, a representative from the DOJ, and the media; the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses also failed to establish that there was earnest effort to coordinate with and secure the presence of the required witnesses. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In People v. Reyes, the Court enumerated certain instances when absence of the required witnesses may be justified, viz.: It must be emphasized that the prosecution must be able to prove a justifiable ground in omitting certain requirements provided in Sec. 21 such as, but not limited to the following: (1) media representatives are not available at the time or that the police operatives had no time to alert the media due to the immediacy of the operation they were about to undertake, especially if it is done in more remote areas; (2) the police operatives, with the same reason, failed to find an available representative of the National Prosecution Service; (3) the police officers, due to time constraints brought about by the urgency of the operation to be undertaken and in order to comply with the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code in the timely delivery of prisoners, were not able to comply with all the requisites set forth in Section 21 of R.A. 9165. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)


- It must be alleged and proved that the presence of the three witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seized was not obtained due to reason/s such as: (1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Section 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that only two (2) witnesses are required to be present during the implementation of a search warrant; nevertheless, Sec. 8 of Rule 126 is a general provision with respect to the implementation of search warrants in all kinds of cases, such as for illegal firearms, infringing goods, or incriminating documents; on the other hand, Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended, and as implemented by its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), is a special provision that applies specifically to the seizure and confiscation of dangerous drugs; in case of conflict between a general law and a special law, the latter must prevail regardless of the dates of their enactment; thus, it has been held that 
- the fact that one law is special and the other general creates a presumption that the special act is to be considered as remaining an exception of the general act, one as a general law of the land and the other as the law of the particular case; further, Sec. 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is not even a substantive law; rather, it is a mere remedial provision; in determining whether a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the practice and procedure of the lower courts, abridges, enlarges, or modifies any substantive right, the test is whether the rule really regulates procedure, that is, the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for a disregard or infraction of them; if the rule takes away a vested right, it is not procedural; if the rule creates a right such as the right to appeal, it may be classified as a substantive matter; but if it operates as a means of implementing an existing right then the rule deals merely with procedure; here, Congress enacted Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 to ensure the identity and integrity of the seized drugs and to prevent tampering thereof; as stated in People v. Acub, in all prosecutions for violations of R.A. 9165, the corpus delicti is the dangerous drug itself; its existence is essential to a judgment of conviction; hence, the identity of the dangerous drug must be clearly established; narcotic substances are not readily identifiable; to determine their composition and nature, they must undergo scientific testing and analysis; they are also highly susceptible to alteration, tampering, or contamination; it is imperative, therefore, that the drugs allegedly seized from the accused are the very same objects tested in the laboratory and offered in court as evidence; the chain of custody, as a method of authentication, ensures that unnecessary doubts involving the identity of seized drugs are removed; in the special cases of seizure of drugs, the statutory provision of Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 should apply and must take precedence in contrast to the general remedial provision of Sec. 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The failure of the police officers to provide a reasonable excuse or justification for the absence of these witnesses clearly magnified the lack of concrete effort on their part to comply with the requirements of Section 21; the absence of these witnesses constitutes a substantial gap in the chain of custody and raises doubts on the integrity and evidentiary value of the items that were allegedly seized from the accused-appellant; it militates against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the law deserves faithful compliance, especially by the police officers who ought to have known the proper procedure in the seizure and handling of the confiscated items, especially since the small volume of the suspected drugs made it easier for the items to be corrupted or tampered with. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

#### COMPROMISE JUDGMENT

Concept 
- The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board concluded that it was petitioners, not respondents, who refused to comply with the Compromise Agreement by allegedly refusing to pay their tenurial dues 
- an obligation not actually stipulated in the Compromise Agreement; in Viesca v. Gilinsky: It is settled that neither the courts nor quasi-judicial bodies can impose upon the parties a judgment different from their compromise agreement or against the very terms and conditions of their agreement without contravening the universally established principle that a contract is the law between the parties; the courts can only approve the agreement of parties; they cannot make a contract for them. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### CONSPIRACY

Existence of 
- The Court disagrees with the CA's findings that conspiracy was sufficiently established; the pronouncements of the Court in PNP-CIDG v. Villafuerte, a case involving the same factual backdrop, find full application in the instant case, to wit: It bears stressing that while the Office of the Ombudsman's factual findings in their entirety tend to demonstrate a sequence of irregularities in the procurement of the LPOHs, this does not ipso facto translate into a conspiracy between each and every person involved in the procurement process; for conspiracy to be appreciated, it must be clearly shown that there was a conscious design to commit an offense; conspiracy is not the product of negligence but of intentionality on the part of cohorts; conspiracy is never presumed; there is a sheer dearth of evidence on Lukban's participation in the alleged conspiracy to defraud the government. (Lukban vs. Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, G.R. 238563, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ARBITRATION COMMISSION (CIAC)

Jurisdiction 
- Provisions of law which define the jurisdiction of a quasi-judicial agency "must be viewed in the light of the nature and function" of the particular agency whose jurisdiction is sought to be invoked; thus, the jurisdiction of the CIAC must also be viewed in the light of the legislative rationale behind the tribunal's creation; it is glaringly apparent from the whereas clauses of E.O. No. 1008, and Section 2 thereof that the CIAC was established to serve as a tribunal which will expeditiously resolve disputes within the construction industry; the CIAC was formed to resolve disputes involving transactions and business relationships within the construction industry; it is for this reason that Section 4 prescribes that the CIAC shall only have jurisdiction over "disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines"; the foregoing phrase limits the jurisdiction of the CIAC not only as to subject matter jurisdiction but also as to jurisdiction over the parties; thus, the CIAC can acquire jurisdiction if the dispute arises from or is connected with the construction industry, both parties to such dispute are involved in construction in the Philippines, and they agree to submit their dispute to arbitration. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Respondent Vilvar, citing Sections 35 and 21 of the R.A. 9285 asserts that CIAC jurisdiction is not limited to contractual relations; however, it has already been demonstrated that the presence of a construction contract is an essential requisite for the CIAC to acquire jurisdiction; while it is indeed true that Sections 35 and 21 of the ADR Law confirm CIAC jurisdiction over construction disputes regardless of whether or not they arise from a contract, it must be noted that Section 21 only contemplates "matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature"; therefore, while CIAC may have jurisdiction over non-contractual disputes (for instance, a tortious breach of contract), these disputes must still arise from or be connected with a construction contract entered into by parties in the Philippines who agree to submit such disputes to arbitration, which is not the case here; the relationship between the parties in this case can hardly be considered commercial in nature; commercial acts have been defined as those acts "which tend to the satisfaction of necessities by means of exchange or of the rendition of services, effected with a purpose of gain"; the only relation between the spouses Ang and respondent Caramats is that they are adjoining lot owners; and the spouses do not even have any relation at all to respondents Soto and Vilvar, other than that involving the alleged damage to the Ang residence; the only nexus between the spouses Ang and the respondents in this case is spatial in nature, and this relation is not enough to vest jurisdiction in the CIAC. (Id.)


- The jurisdiction of the CIAC is provided in Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008, or the Construction Industry Arbitration Law; this provision lays down three requisites for acquisition of jurisdiction by the CIAC, first: a dispute arising from or connected with a construction contract; second, such contract must have been entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines; and third, an agreement by the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration; given the allegations in the spouses Ang's complaint and the issues raised in their petition before this Court, the foregoing requisites obviously do not apply to the case at bar; the spouses' cause of action does not proceed from any construction contract or any accessory contract thereto but from the alleged damage inflicted upon their property by virtue of respondents' construction activities. (Id.)

#### CONTRACTS

Annulment of 
- Article 1397 of the Civil Code provides that "persons who are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted"; even if they were, they still filed the wrong action; the contracting party's incapacity is a ground for annulment of contract, not rescission; petitioners pray for the rescission of the contract, but the ground they raised is one for annulment of contract; Article 1397 of the Civil Code specifies who may institute such action: ARTICLE 1397. The action for the annulment of contracts may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily; however, persons who are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; nor can those who exerted intimidation, violence, or undue influence, or employed fraud, or caused mistake base their action upon these flaws of the contract; even if this Court were to consider petitioners' action as one for annulment of contract, they are still not the proper parties to file such action; they are not parties to the Deed of Absolute Sale, and neither are they obliged principally or subsidiarily with regard to the Deed of Absolute Sale; the trial court's dismissal of their Complaint would still be proper. (Mañas, joined by wife Lena Isabelle Y. Mañas vs. Roca, et al., G.R. 208845, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### COURT PERSONNEL

Conduct 
- Ancheta's acts seriously undermined the trust and confidence of the public in the entire Judiciary; he ought to protect the image of the Judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, especially that it has been the source of his bread and butter for almost forty (40) years; his acts created the impression to the mind of the public that instead of being a bastion of justice, the Judiciary has become a haven of corruption; his explanation that he was merely motivated by his desire to help someone seeking justice, which according to him is one of the pillars of Christianity, and he did not obtain financial gain for his participation, cannot absolve him from administrative liability; Ancheta's concept of helping someone in this particular instance is skewed in that it corrupted an officer of the court who, among others, was unfortunately quick to forget his Code of Professional Responsibility and his Oath as a lawyer for allowing himself to be drawn by the glitter of money; his insistence that he did not gain any financial reward from the transactions is immaterial; in administrative cases, the issue is whether or not the employee has breached the norms and standards of service, as in this case. (Re: Investigation and Report Concerning Samuel Ancheta Jr., Records Officer III, et al. vs. Atty. Corro, et al., A.M. No. 2019-17-SC, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility; conduct at all times must not only be characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above suspicion; Atty. Toledo was appointed Clerk of Court of Branch 259 in 1996 while Barcelona was transferred to said court as clerk in 1994; Branch 259 was already designated as a special court for heinous crimes; in 2000, it was designated as a special court for drug cases; they were well-aware of the degree of responsibility imposed upon them as evidence custodians and the efficiency expected of them in the reception and storage of evidence considering the nature of the cases that Branch 259 handles; Office of the Court Administrator v. Cabe and Mendoza v. Mabutas, cited. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)


- The image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of its personnel; all court personnel are mandated to adhere to the strictest standards of honesty, integrity, morality, and decency in both their professional and personal conduct; in order to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice, they must exemplify the highest sense of honesty and integrity not only in the performance of their official duties but also in their private dealings with other people; public service demands the highest level of honesty and transparency from its officers and employees; the Constitution requires that all public officers and employees be, at all times, accountable to the people, serve with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice; and lead modest public lives. (Re: Investigation and Report Concerning Samuel Ancheta Jr., Records Officer III, et al. vs. Atty. Corro, et al., A.M. No. 2019-17-SC, Feb. 18, 2020)

Grave misconduct 
- Ancheta has been with the Court for thirty-eight (38) long years; his mother served the Court for almost forty (40) years and was awarded as a model employee; it is thus lamentable that he not only failed to emulate the exemplary service his mother dedicated to the Court, but likewise failed to meet the basic standards of propriety, honesty and fairness exacted from all government employees; parenthetically, his years of service in the Court cannot serve to mitigate his offense, but has to be appreciated as aggravating; length of service can either be a mitigating or an aggravating circumstance depending on the facts of each case; it is usually considered as an aggravating circumstance when the offense committed is serious or grave or if length of service is a factor that facilitates the commission of the offense, as in this case. (Re: Investigation and Report Concerning Samuel Ancheta Jr., Records Officer III, et al. vs. Atty. Corro, et al., A.M. No. 2019-17-SC, Feb. 18, 2020)


- Grave misconduct is classified as a grave offense for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even, as in this case, for the first time offenders; defined as the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer coupled with the elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules; corruption, as an element of grave misconduct, consists in the official or employee's act of unlawfully or wrongfully using his position to gain benefit for one's self. (Id.)

Gross neglect of duty 
- In 2008, Atty. Toledo had been administratively charged for violation of the lawyer's oath, violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, oppression, dishonesty, harassment, and immorality in A.M. No. P-07-2403 where the OCA recommended his suspension for a period of three (3) months for conduct unbecoming a public official and a court employee; although the Court dismissed the complaint, it reminded Atty. Toledo to be more circumspect in his public and private dealings; he apparently disregarded the Court's warning and continued to show lack of diligence in his administrative function, completely unmindful of the heavy burden and responsibility he carries in the dispensation of justice; Atty. Toledo and Barcelona found liable for gross neglect of duty which merits the penalty of dismissal from the service even if the offense was committed for the first time under the Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)


- The ocular inspection was conducted and the drug evidence were discovered missing on November 11, 2003; the RTC Decision in Criminal Case No. 01-1229 was rendered on November 10, 2003 while the decision in Criminal Case No. 03-0408 was promulgated on December 22, 2003; because of Barcelona's and Atty. Toledo's display of laxity in the custody of evidence, the corpora delicti in these two criminal cases vanished even before the actions were terminated; their inexcusable lapses in the safekeeping of the drug evidence constitute flagrant and palpable breach tantamount to gross neglect of duty as they undermine the integrity of the decisions rendered in the criminal cases. (Id.)

Simple neglect of duty and gross neglect of duty 
- The Court agrees with the findings of the OCA that Atty. Toledo and Barcelona have both been negligent in the performance of their duty to safely keep the physical evidence in the court's custody; we find them guilty of gross neglect of duty and not merely simple neglect of duty; Simple neglect of duty is defined as "the failure to give proper attention to a task expected of an employee resulting from either carelessness or indifference"; however, when an employee's negligence displays want of even the slightest care or conscious indifference to the consequences or by flagrant and palpable breach of duty, the omission is regarded as gross neglect of duty; there is gross neglect of duty when a public official or employee's negligence is characterized by the glaring want of care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently, but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)

#### COURTS

Construction disputes 
- OCA Circular No. 111-2014 reiterates an earlier circular which directs all courts to dismiss all construction disputes pending with their salas; it is clear that OCA Circular No. 111-2014 does not operate to ipso facto dismiss all construction disputes pending before the regional trial courts; but instead directs all presiding judges to issue orders dismissing such suits. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)

Hierarchy of courts 
- There are serious and compelling reasons to warrant direct resort to the Court; considering that what is invoked here is the constitutionality of DOJ Circular No. 27 that continues to be implemented in the prosecution of cases involving dangerous drugs, Sayre is justified in seeking the immediate action of the Court; the outcome of the present petition will certainly affect hundreds of on-going plea bargaining in dangerous drugs cases. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)


- With the enactment of R.A. 9282 on March 30, 2004, the CTA was elevated to a collegiate court with special jurisdiction and of the same level as the Court of Appeals; in the same way, when it was first created by virtue of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1486 on June 11, 1978, the Sandiganbayan was a special court of equal rank as the CFIs; P.D. No. 1606 was issued shortly thereafter on December 10, 1978 which declared the Sandiganbayan as a special court of the same level as the Court of Appeals; the aforequoted statutory provisions expressly state that the Presiding Justices and Associate Justices of the CTA and the Sandiganbayan shall have the same rank, salary, privileges, and emoluments; be subject to the same inhibitions and disqualifications; and enjoy the same retirement and other benefits provided under existing laws as the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals; they additionally prescribe that any increase in the salaries of the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals shall be extended to and enjoyed by the Presiding Justices and Associate Justices of the CTA and the Sandiganbayan. (Re: Expenses of Retirement of Court of Appeals Justices, A.M. No. 19-02-03-CA, Feb. 11, 2020)

Inherent powers 
- Both law and jurisprudence grant unto Her Honor the power to reverse her original ruling, where necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice; the power to amend and control its process and orders is an inherent power of the court, pursuant to Section 5(g) of Rule 135 of the Rules of Court; the inherent powers of a court to amend and control its processes and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice include the court's right and power to reverse itself, especially when in its honest opinion, it has committed error or mistake in judgment, and where to adhere to the decision will cause injustice or injury to a party litigant. (Domingo vs. Macapagal, G.R. 242577, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Variance rule 
- As a rule, an accused can only be convicted of the crime with which he or she is charged; this rule proceeds from the constitutional guarantee that an accused shall always be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or her; an exception to this is the rule on variance under Section 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court; the due recognition of the constitutional right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation through the criminal complaint or information is decisive of whether his or her prosecution for a crime stands or not; the right is not transgressed if the information sufficiently alleges facts and omissions constituting an offense that includes the offense established to have been committed by the accused, as in his case. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### CRUELTY

As an aggravating circumstance 
- Cruelty was correctly appreciated for the three killings as it was established that they were kicked, boxed, and pistol-whipped before having been killed; such acts constitute deliberate augmentation of a wrong by causing another wrong not necessary for its commission. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### DAMAGES

Actual damages 
- Under the Civil Code, when an injury has been sustained, actual damages may be awarded; only the expenses proven by credible evidence may be awarded; the funeral and burial expenses were duly supported with official receipts when presented in the RTC. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

Exemplary damages 
- Awarded upon finding that ES Trucking acted with gross negligence for failing to duly register the prime mover truck with the appropriate government agency, and for failing to impose a stringent selection procedure in hiring and supervising Timtim; the award of exemplary damages is justified further by ES Trucking's wanton disregard of the law and evident bad faith through its highly reprehensible conduct of altering the body number of the prime mover truck to avoid detection, in violation of its undertaking to preserve the original state of the vehicle while the case is pending; ES Trucking is directed to pay P50,000.00 as exemplary damages to the Heirs of Catalina. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Exemplary damages may be awarded if the dismissal was effected in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner; the person claiming damages must prove the existence of bad faith by clear and convincing evidence, for the law always presumes good faith; Roxas failed to establish that respondents were motivated by ill will or that his dismissal was done in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

Modification of award of damages 
- Modification of the award of damages is in order; still following People v. Tulagan, a person found guilty of rape by sexual assault of a child less than 12 years of age must compensate the latter with civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each; this Court likewise leaves undisturbed the initial grant of actual damages for medicine expenses and moral damages and impose only the additional awards of civil indemnity and exemplary damages at P50,000.00 each. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The Court of Appeals' imposition of monetary liability on accused-appellant must be modified; People v. Jugueta provides: When the circumstances surrounding the crime call for the imposition of reclusion perpetua only, there being no ordinary aggravating circumstance, the Court rules that the proper amounts should be P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 exemplary damages, regardless of the number of qualifying aggravating circumstances present; since accused-appellant was meted the penalty of reclusion perpetua for raping AAA, accused-appellant must be held liable to the modified amounts of P75,000.00 each as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)

Moral damages 
- Article 2206 of the Civil Code expressly grants moral damages in addition to the award of civil indemnity; an award of P100,000.00 as moral damages, sufficient to answer for the mental anguish suffered by the Heirs of Catalina because of her death. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Moral damages are recoverable where the dismissal of the employee was attended by bad faith or fraud or constituted an act oppressive to labor, or was done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### DANGEROUS DRUGS

Animus possidendi 
- Animus possidendi is a state of mind; it is determined on a case-to-case basis taking into consideration the prior and contemporaneous acts of the accused and the surrounding circumstances; it must be inferred from the attendant events in each particular case; a mere unfounded assertion of the accused that he or she did not know that he or she had possession of the illegal drug is insufficient, animus possidendi is then presumed because he or she was thereby shown to have performed an act that the law prohibited and penalized; possession of dangerous drugs constitutes prima facie evidence of knowledge or animus possidendi sufficient to convict an accused in the absence of a satisfactory explanation; consequently, the burden of evidence is shifted to the accused to explain the absence of knowledge or animus possidendi. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### DENIAL

Defense of 
- Denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, as in this case, is a negative and self-serving defense; it carries scant, if not nil, evidentiary value; it cannot prevail over the consistent and categorical declarations of credible witnesses on affirmative matters. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al. vs. G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Pueyo's weak defense of denial crumbles before AAA's positive testimony; jurisprudence instructs that "between a categorical statement that has the earmarks of truth on the one hand and bare denial, on the other, the former is generally held to prevail"; no reason to hold otherwise in this case. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### DENIAL AND ALIBI

Defenses of 
- It is well-settled that denial is an "intrinsically weak defense which must be supported by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility"; alibi, on the other hand, is the "weakest of all defenses, for it is easy to contrive and difficult to disprove and for which reason it is generally rejected; it is imperative that the accused establishes two elements: (1) he was not at the locus delicti at the time the offense was committed; and (2) it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission"; accused-appellant was unable to establish any of the foregoing elements to substantiate his alibi; the crime was committed in the same city where accused-appellant claimed he was at; thus, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission; in contrast to AAA's direct, positive, and categorical testimony, accused-appellant's defense will not stand. (People vs. Castillo, G.R. 242276, Feb. 18, 2020)

#### DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATION BOARD (DARAB)

Jurisdiction 
- Even if the case for recovery of possession could be considered an agrarian dispute under R.A. 6657, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) would still have no jurisdiction over it; Rule II, Section 1.11 of the 2003 Rules of Procedure provides that the Board, as with the Provincial Adjudicator, has jurisdiction over cases that involve determining agricultural land titles "for the purpose of preserving the tenure of the agricultural lessee or actual tenant-farmer or farmer-beneficiaries and effecting the ouster of the interloper or intruder in one and the same proceeding"; neither petitioners nor their predecessors-in-interest disputed the issuance of titles in respondents' names; in any case, determinations of titles under Section 1.11 must be made for the purpose of preserving the tenure of the agricultural lessee or actual tenant-farmer or farmer-beneficiaries; since respondents had yet to submit the property under the CARP, any determination on the preservation of the tenure of petitioners, or their predecessors-in-interest, would have been premature; thus, the DARAB had no jurisdiction over respondents' action; any decision rendered without jurisdiction over the subject matter is considered a void judgment, which has no binding legal effect; Amoguis v. Ballado, cited. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The DARAB simply presumed that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest became respondents' tenants after the titles had been issued in respondents' names; tenancy, however, cannot be presumed, but must be proven; as echoed in Bumagat v. Arribay, among the requisites to establish tenancy is consent between the parties: A case involving agricultural land does not immediately qualify it as an agrarian dispute; the mere fact that the land is agricultural does not ipso facto make the possessor an agricultural lessee or tenant; there are conditions or requisites before he can qualify as an agricultural lessee or tenant, and the subject being agricultural land constitutes just one condition; for the DARAB to acquire jurisdiction over the case, there must exist a tenancy relation between the parties; in order for a tenancy agreement to take hold over a dispute, it is essential to establish all its indispensable elements: 1) that the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; 2) that the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; 3) that there is consent between the parties to the relationship; 4) that the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; 5) that there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and 6) that the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee. (Id.)

#### DEPOSITIONS PENDING ACTION

Requirements 
- Depositions pending action may be obtained without leave of court after an answer has been served in accordance with Section 1, Rule 23 of the Rules; there is no provision in Rule 23 that requires the party requesting for an oral deposition to state the purpose or purposes of the deposition; the only matters that have to be stated in the notice under Section 15 of Rule 23 are the time and place for taking the deposition, the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, or if unknown, a general description sufficient to identify the person to be examined or the class or group to which he belongs; the trial court cannot expand the requirements under Rule 23. (Malonzo, et al. vs. Sucere Foods Corporation, G.R. 240773, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The RTC observed that Section 3 of Rule 23 on examination and cross-examination and Section l7 on record, oath, and objections will be best complied with if the deposition is taken before the court instead of a notary public or any person authorized to administer oath; to require that these matters be taken before the RTC because they require the examination and cross-examination of the deponent would render useless the entire rules on discovery which were crafted by the Court to help expedite the disposition of cases; Section 10, Rule 23 of the Rules provides that depositions may be taken before any judge, notary public, or the person referred to in Section 14 of Rule 23, i.e., any person authorized to administer oaths if the parties so stipulate in writing; until the Court revises its rules and removes the authority to take depositions from the notary public or any person authorized to administer oaths if the parties so stipulate, these persons retain their authorities to take depositions; the trial courts cannot arrogate these duties exclusively upon themselves; hence, the CA did not commit any reversible error in setting aside the RTC's Order. (Id.)

#### DIRECT ASSAULT

Elements 
- Petitioner is charged with the second mode of direct assault under Art. 148 of the RPC; its elements are the following: 1. That the offender (a) makes an attack, (b) employs force, (c) makes a serious intimidation, or (d) makes a serious resistance. 2. That the person assaulted is a person in authority or his agent. 3. That at the time of the assault the person in authority or his agent (a) is engaged in the actual performance of official duties, or (b) that he is assaulted by reason of the past performance of official duties. 4. That the offender knows that the one he is assaulting is a person in authority or his agent in the exercise of his duties. 5. That there is no public uprising; a police officer is an agent of a person in authority; an agent of a person in authority is one who, "by direct provision of law or by election or by appointment by competent authority, is charged with the maintenance of public order and the protection and security of life and property, such as barrio councilman, barrio policeman and barangay leader, and any person who comes to the aid of persons in authority"; being a police officer, P02 Navarro is an agent of a person in authority; the second, third, fourth, and fifth elements of direct assault are present in this case; however, the first element of the offense is not present. (Mallari vs. People, G.R. 224679, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### EJECTMENT

Physical or material possession of the land 
- The sole issue in ejectment cases is physical or material possession of the subject property, independent of any claim of ownership by the parties; Section 16, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court provides the exception to the rule in that the issue of ownership shall be resolved in deciding the issue of possession if the question of possession is intertwined with the issue of ownership; in the related ejectment case, the parties were allowed to prove how they came into possession of the property; in the ejectment case, the issue of ownership over Creek I was resolved in favor of respondent; this Court has consistently held that where the issue of ownership is inseparably linked to that of possession, adjudication of the issue on ownership is not final and binding, but merely for the purpose of resolving the issue of possession; in an ejectment case, questions as to the validity of the title cannot be resolved definitively; a separate action to directly attack the validity of the title must be filed, as was in fact filed by petitioner, to fully thresh out as to who possesses a valid title over the subject property; thus, any ruling on ownership that was passed upon in the ejectment case is not and should not be binding on Civil Case No. 00-11133. (Tiña vs. Sta. Clara Estate, Inc., G.R. 239979, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### EMINENT DOMAIN OR EXPROPRIATION

Just compensation 
- As between the filing of the original Complaint and Amended Complaint, we rule that the computation of just compensation should be reckoned from the time of the filing of the original Complaint; there was no actual taking in this case prior to the filing of the Complaint, thus, the time of taking should be reckoned from the filing of the Complaint. Hence, the value of the property at the time of filing of the original Complaint which is deemed to be the time of taking of the property, and not the filing of the Amended Complaint, should be considered in determining the just compensation due to the respondents. (Republic vs. Castillo, et al., G.R. 190453, Feb. 26, 2020) 


- In eminent domain cases, just compensation entails not only the determination of the proper amount to be paid to the owners of the property, but also the payment of such amount within a reasonable time; in National Power Corporation v. Manalastas, the Court held that the just compensation payable to the property owner amounts to an effective forbearance on the part of the government – a proper subject of interest, viz.: If property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interests on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court; in fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- It has been consistently held that the property's fair market value is the just compensation to which the owner of condemned property is entitled; market value is the price agreed on by a willing buyer and willing seller, both of whom are not compelled to enter into the transaction; it has also been described as the amount fixed in the open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal trade and competition. (Id.) 


- Just compensation is, as a general rule, based on the price or value of the property at the time the complaint for expropriation was filed; by way of exception, National Transmission Corporation v. Oroville Development Corporation instructs that when the government takes the property before initiating the expropriation case, the property's value at the time of the prior taking must be used as the basis for determining just compensation; here, since the Republic initiated expropriation proceedings before taking the subject property, it follows that the land's value at the time of the filing of the complaint, i.e., June 25, 1990, should be used as the basis for just compensation. (Id.)


- Necessarily, just compensation cannot be arrived at arbitrarily; it must be determined only after an evaluation of several factors; the assessment of these factors is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who must enlist commissioners tasked to receive and appraise evidence on the property's value; it has been held in a long line of cases that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function, one that is best addressed to the discretion of the trial court; the trial court, however, should not be without aid in the ascertainment of what constitutes just compensation; for this purpose and as alluded to earlier, the rules direct the court to appoint not more than three competent and disinterested persons as commissioners to ascertain and report to it the value of the property sought to be taken; the commissioners may then determine just compensation based on the evidence presented before them, and, for the same purpose, they are also authorized to enter and inspect the property and its surroundings; after the reception and scrutiny of the evidence, the commissioners have the responsibility of reporting their findings to the trial court; it has been held that trial with the aid of the commissioners is a substantial right; therefore, the appointment of commissioners to ascertain just compensation for the property sought to be taken is a mandatory requirement in expropriation cases; however, this does not mean that the commissioners' determination of just compensation is final and binding on the parties; because such determination is ultimately a judicial function, the trial court is given the discretion to either accept or reject the commissioners' findings in whole or in part; if the court rejects their report, it may require them to render a supplemental report on facts yet to be taken up, or it may appoint another set of commissioners to provide it with an entirely new report; the trial court is also allowed to disregard the findings of the commissioners and use its own estimate of the property's value; however, it may only do so for valid reasons, such as when the commissioners apply illegal principles to the evidence, when they disregard a clear preponderance of evidence, or when the amount allowed is either grossly inadequate or excessive; once the trial court is satisfied with the amount of just compensation, it may render judgment ordering payment thereof to the property owner. (Id.)


- Rule 67 of the Rules of Court governs expropriation proceedings; with respect to consequential damages, Section 6 of Rule 67 is instructive; in Republic v. Soriano, the Court deemed the award of consequential damages improper because "the subject property is being expropriated in its entirety, there is no remaining portion which may suffer an impairment or decrease in value as a result of the expropriation"; only a portion, and not the entire area, of the respondents' property was expropriated; the affected area of the expropriation undertaken was only "218 sq. m." out of the total area of 380 sq. m.; be that as it may, the Court deems the award of consequential damages in favor of the respondents erroneous; the sheer fact that there is a remaining portion of real property after the expropriation is not enough, by and of itself, to be basis for the award of consequential damages; it must still be proven by sufficient evidence that the remaining portion suffers from an impairment or decrease in value; a review of the records reveals that the RTC's award of consequential damages is not supported by any evidence establishing that the remaining 162 sq. m. of the subject property suffered from any impairment or decrease in value; therefore, the award of consequential damages must be deleted. (Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Vda. De Ramos, et al., G.R. 211576, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court finds that the RTC erred in ordering petitioner Republic to pay legal interest on the amount of just compensation; in Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic, citing Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines, the Court explained that "the rationale for imposing interest on just compensation is to compensate the property owners for the income that they would have made if they had been properly compensated 
- meaning if they had been paid the full amount of just compensation 
- at the time of taking when they were deprived of their property"; it is not disputed whatsoever that the respondents received the amount determined by the RTC as the just, fair, and equitable compensation for the subject property, i.e., P2,100.00 per sq. m. or P457,800.00, before petitioner Republic took possession of the subject property; hence, with the respondents having acknowledged the receipt of the full amount of just compensation even prior to the time of taking, petitioner is not liable for the payment of legal interest; the award of legal interest of 6 percent  per annum must be deleted. (Id.)


- While the Court considers the payment of transfer taxes as not forming part of the consequential damages allowed under the Rules of Court, it must be clarified, however, that the courts are not precluded from considering the value of capital gains tax (CGT) and other transfer taxes in determining the amount of just compensation to be awarded to the affected owner; the recent case of Republic of the Philippines v. Spouses Bunsay, Section 5 of R.A. 8974 sets forth the standards in the determination of just compensation: Section 5. Standards for the Assessment of the Value of the Land Subject of Expropriation Proceedings or Negotiated Sale. 
- In order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, the court may consider, among other well-established factors, the following relevant standards: (c) The value declared by the owners; . . . (h) Such facts and events as to enable the affected property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly-situated lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government, and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as possible; as further explained by the Court, CGT, being a tax on passive income, is imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code on the seller as a consequence of the latter's presumed income from the sale or exchange of real property; notably, however, the transfer of real property by way of expropriation is not an ordinary sale contemplated under Article 1458 of the Civil Code; rather, it is akin to a "forced sale" or one which arises not from the consensual agreement of the vendor and vendee, but by compulsion of law; unlike in an ordinary sale wherein the vendor sets the selling price, the compensation paid to the affected owner in an expropriation proceeding comes in the form of just compensation determined by the court; just compensation is defined as the fair and full equivalent of the loss incurred by the affected owner; the loss incurred by the affected owner necessarily includes all incidental costs to facilitate the transfer of the expropriated property to the expropriating authority, including the CGT due on the forced sale and other transfer taxes; these costs must be taken into consideration in determining just compensation in the same way these costs are factored into the selling price of real property in an arm's length transaction. (Id.)

Stages 
- The ascertainment of exactly how much property was taken is necessary to determine the full amount of just compensation; in expropriation cases involving land, just compensation is generally set on a per square meter basis; thus, without knowing the precise area taken by the State, there is no way of definitively setting the amount payable to the respondents; in addition, there is a need to determine how much of the respondents' property was expropriated so that they can be reimbursed only for what cannot be returned to them; jurisprudence clearly provides for the remedies available to a landowner when his land is taken by the government for public use; the owner may recover his or her property if its return is feasible, or, if it is not, he or she may demand payment of just compensation; upon remand, the trial court must first and foremost determine how much of respondent's property had actually been taken. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- The power of eminent domain has been described as "the ultimate right of the sovereign power to appropriate, not only the public but the private property of all citizens within the territorial sovereignty, to public purpose"; it is an inherent power of the state, not granted but merely limited by constitutional fiat, viz.: Section 9. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation; the provision places two express limitations on the power of eminent domain: first, the condemned property must be used for a public purpose, and second, the exercising authority must pay the property owner just compensation; correlatively, expropriation cases are divided into two stages; the first is concerned with the propriety of condemning the property, while the second involves the determination of just compensation; the first phase begins with the filing of the complaint before the trial court, which is then tasked to ascertain the purpose of the taking; if it finds that the property is being taken for a public purpose, it shall issue an order condemning the property, otherwise it must dismiss the case; if the court issues an order of condemnation, it must then proceed to the second phase—the determination of just compensation; for this purpose, the rules direct the trial court to appoint commissioners, who will be assigned to aid it in ascertaining the fair value of the expropriated property; the trial court will then set the amount of just compensation, order the plaintiff to pay such amount to the defendant, and proceed to completely dispose of the case. (Id.)


- The record shows a road now traverses the respondents' expropriated land; the payment of just compensation must therefore follow as a matter of course; however, the records do not show exactly how much of the property was taken; likewise, the time of taking by the government does not appear; thus, the Court is left with no other alternative but to remand the case to the trial court for a proper determination of: first, how much of the respondents' property had in fact been taken; second, when was the property so taken; and finally, the amount of just compensation due and owed to the respondents; the RTC must be guided by the pronouncements set forth hereunder, which shall form the law of the case. (Id.)

Taking 
- In the seminal case of Rep. of the Phils. v. Vda. de Castellvi, the Court laid down several circumstances that constitute the taking of private property in expropriation proceedings; these circumstances, adopted by subsequent case law, are summed up as follows: (1) the expropriator must enter private property; (2) the entrance in to private property must be for more than a momentary period; (3) the entry into the property should be under warrant or color of legal authority; (4) the property must be devoted to a public use or otherwise informally appropriated or injuriously affected; and (5) the utilization of the property for public use must be in such a way as to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment of the property; taking therefore occurs when the government actually deprives or dispossesses the proprietor of his or her property; so too, when there is "an intrusion so immediate and direct as to subtract from the owner's full enjoyment of the property and to limit his exploitation of it," the said property is deemed taken. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- The determination of the time of taking is necessary for two reasons; first, interest, which is imposed as damages for delaying the payment of just compensation, begins to run from the time the property is taken from its owner; second, the nature of the deposit required pending the determination of just compensation will depend on whether the property was taken before or after the date of effectivity of R.A. 8974, which governs expropriation proceedings relative to national government infrastructure projects. (Id.)

#### EMPLOYEES, KINDS OF

Managerial employees 
- In Casco, which cited Lima Land, Inc. v. Cuevas, We distinguished between managerial employees, on the one hand, and rank and file personnel on the other hand, insofar as terminating them on the basis of loss of trust and confidence, thus: As firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence, loss of trust and confidence, as a just cause for termination of employment, is premised on the fact that an employee concerned holds a position where greater trust is placed by management and from whom greater fidelity to duty is correspondingly expected; this includes managerial personnel entrusted with confidence on delicate matters, such as the custody, handling, or care and protection of the employer's property; the betrayal of this trust is the essence of the offense for which an employee is penalized; in a plethora of cases, this Court has distinguished the treatment of managerial employees from that of rank-and-file personnel, insofar as the application of the doctrine of loss of trust and confidence is concerned; with respect to rank-and-file personnel, loss of trust and confidence, as ground for valid dismissal, requires proof of involvement in the alleged events in question, and that mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not be sufficient; but as regards a managerial employee, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for such loss of confidence, such as when the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee concerned is responsible for the purported misconduct, and the nature of his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded of his position. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452. Feb. 12, 2020)


- The determination of whether an employee is part of the managerial staff depends on the employee's duties and responsibilities: Managerial employees are defined as those vested with the powers or prerogatives to lay down management policies and to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees or effectively recommend such managerial actions; they refer to those whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or a subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff; officers and members of the managerial staff perform work directly related to management policies of their employer and customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment; at the very least, Batucan held a supervisory position, which made him part of the managerial staff; Batucan was petitioner's team leader and officer-in-charge in LBC Danao. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP

Four-fold test 
- The lower tribunals used the "four-fold test" in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, to wit: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the power to control the employee's conduct; the LA and the CA anchored their findings of employer-employee relationship on the Appointment Paper presented by respondent; this evidence, however, refers to his appointment as an instructor, as well as his duties and responsibilities as such; respondent was removed as a missionary of Abiko Baptist Church, not as an instructor of MBIS; there is no evidence or allegation to show that respondent's status as a missionary is the same or dependent on his appointment as an instructor of MBIS; the removal as a missionary may have affected respondent's status as instructor of MBIS, but the Court is not convinced that there was an illegal dismissal; the Mission Policy Agreement and Appointment Paper establish two (2) different positions held by respondent, and means that being a missionary of BSAABC is separate from being an instructor of MBIS, though they may be completely related. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Payment of wages 
- We do not find in the records concrete evidence of the alleged monthly compensation of respondent amounting to $550; respondent is not even consistent in claiming the exact amount of his supposed salary as he claims he was receiving $650 in his Motion for Reconsideration with the NLRC and Petition before the CA; although petitioners do not deny that respondent was receiving "love gifts" in the amount of $550, they aver that these came from ABA and Abiko Baptist Church in Japan; respondent also admitted that the "main bulk of the fund came from donor American Baptist Association"; "salary" is a general term defined as remuneration for services given, but the term does not establish a certain kind of relationship; absent any clear indication that the amount respondent was allegedly receiving came from BSAABC or MBIS, or at the very least that ABA, Abiko Baptist Church of Japan and BSAABC and MBIS are one and the same, We cannot concretely establish payment of wages. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Power to discipline or dismiss members 
- Dismissal is inherent in religious congregations as they have the power to discipline their members; the nature of respondent's position as a missionary calls on the exercise of supervision by the church of which he is a member considering that the basis of the relationship between a religious corporation and its members is the latter's absolute adherence to a common religious or spiritual belief; although respondent's removal is clear from the letter, this alone cannot establish an employer-employee relationship. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Power to dismiss employees 
- The NLRC was correct in holding that petitioners performed functions that pertain to those of supervisory classification; the positions that petitioners held involved trust and confidence requiring them to discharge their functions with utmost professionalism and uprightness; as held in Supra Multi-Services, Inc., et al. v. Labitigan, a company has the right to dismiss its employees as a measure of protection, more so in the case of supervisors or personnel who occupy positions of responsibility; an employer cannot be compelled to retain employees who are guilty of acts inimical to its interests; besides, the power to dismiss employees is a recognized prerogative that is inherent in the employer's right to freely manage and regulate its business. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Proof of 
- The respondent's appointment as instructor of petitioners' own educational institution was by virtue of his membership with Abiko Baptist Church; it is one of his duties as a missionary/minister of the same; he was teaching "bible history, philosophy, Christian doctrine, public speaking, English and other religious subjects to seminarians in MBIS intending to be a pastor/minister"; these subject matters and how they prepare or educate their ministers are ecclesiastical in nature which the State cannot regulate unless there is clear violation of secular laws; even his alleged exclusion as instructor is beyond the power of review by the State considering that this is purely an ecclesiastical affair; as to the power to order respondent to areas of mission work, the Court deems it appropriate not to expound on this because aside from being a mere allegation, it is also an ecclesiastical matter as it concerns governance of the congregation; other than the Appointment Paper (as an instructor), no other evidence was adduced by respondent to show an employer-employee relationship. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### EMPLOYMENT, TERMINATION OF

Abandonment 
- Abandonment is the deliberate and unjustified refusal of an employee to resume his employment; it constitutes neglect of duty and is a just cause for termination of employment under the Labor Code; to constitute abandonment, however, there must be a clear and deliberate intent to discontinue one's employment without any intention of returning; in this regard, two elements must concur: (1) failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship, with the second element as the more determinative factor and being manifested by some overt acts; employees who take steps to protest their dismissal cannot logically be said to have abandoned their work; a charge of abandonment is totally inconsistent with the immediate filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal; the filing thereof is proof enough of one's desire to return to work, thus negating any suggestion of abandonment. (JS Unitrade Merchandise, Inc. vs. Samson, Jr., G.R. 200405, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Respondents' charge of abandonment cannot likewise stand; settled is the rule that mere absence or failure to report for work is not tantamount to abandonment; the absence must be accompanied by overt acts unerringly pointing to the fact that the employee simply does not want to work anymore, and the burden of proof to show that there was unjustified refusal to go back to work rests on the employer, which unfortunately, respondents likewise failed to show. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)


- To constitute abandonment there must be a clear and deliberate intent to discontinue one's employment without any intention of returning; to successfully raise abandonment as a just cause for dismissal, two elements must concur: first, failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason, and second, a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship; the second element, being manifested by overt acts, is the more determinative factor; here, Dela Cruz ceased reporting for work as a result of her suspension which she claimed to constitute illegal dismissal; upon the lapse of the preventive suspension period, she was no longer reinstated by ENLI; thus, her absence from work was not due to a deliberate act of abandonment on her part but an act of constructive dismissal on the part of ENLI. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

Burden of proof 
- In termination cases, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee's dismissal was for a valid and authorized cause; consequently, the failure of the employer to prove that the dismissal was valid, would mean that the dismissal was unjustified, and thus illegal; petitioners failed to discharge the burden. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)

Constructive dismissal 
- Although Batucan holds a supervisory position, he cannot be deemed to have acted on petitioner's behalf in committing the acts of sexual harassment; it cannot be assumed that all the illegal acts of managerial staff are authorized or sanctioned by the company, especially when it is committed in the manager's personal capacity; in Verdadero v. Barney Autolines Group of Companies Transport, Inc., this Court ruled that constructive dismissal cannot be assumed if an officer of the company wronged an employee, but the employer did not authorize the act: It is to be emphasized that the abovementioned acts should have been committed by the employer against the employee; unlawful acts committed by a co-employee will not bring the matter within the ambit of constructive dismissal. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Case law defines "constructive dismissal" as follows: Constructive dismissal is defined as quitting or cessation of work because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; when there is a demotion in rank or a diminution of pay and other benefits; it exists if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him except to forego his continued employment; while Roxas's reduced work assignment did effectively result in the diminution of his pay and other benefits, the same did not amount to a clear act of discrimination, insensibility or disdain on the part of BTI so as to force him out of employment; as pointed out by the CA, "the reduced work week which BTI implemented in 2012 was in relation to the government's directive to remove from the roads, public utility vehicles which are 15 years old and above, for the safety of the riding public; the decision to phase out BTI's old buses was therefore not done out of the company's whims and caprices only but instead, a means on the part of BTI to cope with the downsizing of their business operation as consequence of the strict implementation of LTFRB Resolution No. 2013-01"; this exercise of BTI's management prerogative appears to have been done in good faith, and hence, should be upheld; the records fail to show that Roxas was the only employee affected by the reduced work assignment scheme. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Constructive dismissal occurs when an employer makes an employee's continued employment impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, or has made an employee's working conditions or environment harsh, hostile and unfavorable, such that the employee feels obliged to resign from his or her employment; common examples are when the employee is demoted, or when his or her pay or benefits are reduced; however, constructive dismissal is not limited to these instances; the gauge to determine whether there is constructive dismissal, is whether a reasonable person would feel constrained to resign from his or her employment because of the circumstances, conditions, and environment created by the employer for the employee. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Section 9 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code limits the duration of the preventive suspension to a maximum of 30 days; Section 9 is clear that the employer had the positive duty of reinstating the preventively suspended employee upon the lapse of the 30-day period sans extension; when the period of preventive suspension exceeds the maximum period allowed without reinstating the employee actually or through payroll, or when the preventive suspension is for an indefinite period, constructive dismissal sets in; it is admitted that while Dela Cruz's complaint before the Labor Arbiter was pending, the 30-day preventive suspension period expired without ENLI causing its extension; despite the expiration of the preventive suspension period, Dela Cruz did not report for work; however, there was nary an effort on the part of ENLI to reinstate Dela Cruz to her former position either actually or through payroll; the circumstances, taken together, inevitably lead to the conclusion that upon the expiration of the preventive suspension on July 22, 2012, constructive dismissal had set in; having been constructively dismissed, Dela Cruz is entitled to the payment of backwages from the time of her dismissal up to the finality of this decision; she is likewise entitled to reinstatement but considering that seven years have lapsed, it is more in consonance with substantive justice to award her with separation pay computed at one month pay for every year of service. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

Ecclesiastical affairs and secular matters 
- While the State is prohibited from interfering in purely ecclesiastical affairs, the Church is likewise barred from meddling in purely secular matters; an ecclesiastical affair is "one that concerns doctrine, creed, or form of worship of the church, or the adoption and enforcement within a religious association of needful laws and regulations for the government of the membership, and the power of excluding from such associations those deemed unworthy of membership"; based on this definition, an ecclesiastical affair involves the relationship between the church and its members and relates to matters of faith, religious doctrines, worship and governance of the congregation; examples of these so-called ecclesiastical affairs in which the State cannot meddle are proceedings for excommunication, ordinations of religious ministers, administration of sacraments and other activities with attached religious significance"; secular matters, on the other hand, have no relation whatsoever with the practice of faith, worship or doctrines of the church. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Ecclesiastical matters 
- There were three (3) acts which were decided upon by the Abiko Baptist Church against respondent in its letter, to wit: (1) removal as a missionary of Abiko Baptist Church; (2) cancellation of the ABA recommendation as a national missionary; and (3) exclusion of membership from Abiko Baptist Church in Japan; to the mind of the Court, the exclusion of membership from Abiko Baptist Church in Japan and the cancellation of ABA recommendation as a national missionary are ecclesiastical matters which this jurisdiction will not touch upon; these matters are exclusively determined by the church in accordance with the standards they have set; the Court cannot meddle in these affairs since the church has the discretion to choose members who live up to their religious standards; the ABA recommendation as a national missionary is likewise discretionary upon the church since it is a matter of governance of congregation. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Illegal dismissal 
- Gallego patiently waited for three years hoping that he would be re-deployed as promised by respondents; awarding him P200,000.00 moral damages is proper; P200,000.00 exemplary damages awarded to serve as a deterrent to future and subsequent parties from the commission of a similar offense; attorney's fees or 10 percent  of the monetary award, also awarded because he was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interests; all monetary awards to petitioner shall be subject to ten percent (10 percent ) rate as attorney's fees and shall earn the legal interest of six percent (6 percent ) per annum from the date this Decision becomes final and executory until full satisfaction thereof. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In view of the finding of illegal dismissal, Erispe is entitled to the monetary equivalent of his vacation leave benefits as to the unexpired portion of his contract; the employer is obliged to pay an illegally dismissed employee or worker the whole amount of the salaries or wages, plus all other benefits and bonuses and general increases, to which he would have been normally entitled had he not been illegally terminated and had not stopped working; thus, Erispe must be awarded his salaries corresponding to the unexpired portion of his employment contract, or equivalent to 7.36 months as found by the LA; this includes all his corresponding monthly vacation leave pay which is expressly provided in the employment contracts, which is three days per month. (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Just or authorized causes 
- Article 294 of the Labor Code, as renumbered, provides that an employer may terminate the services of an employee only upon just or authorized causes; the burden of proving that the dismissal was for a just or authorized cause lies with the employer; if the employer fails to meet this burden, the conclusion would be that the dismissal was unjustified, and, therefore, illegal; in order to discharge this burden, the employer must present substantial evidence, which is defined as that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion, and not based on mere surmises and conjectures; in this regard, Article 297 of the Labor Code enumerates the just causes for which an employer may terminate an employment. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

Loss of trust and confidence 
- Article 297 (formerly 282) of the Labor Code provides that an employer may terminate its employee for "fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative"; "the requisites for dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence are: (1) the employee concerned must be holding a position of trust and confidence; (2) there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence; and (3) such loss of trust relates to the employee's performance of duties." (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Cadavas v. Court of Appeals, citing Bristol Myers Squibb (Phils.), Inc. v. Baban, explained the two classes of positions of trust, thus: There are two (2) classes of positions of trust; the first class consists of managerial employees; they are defined as those vested with the powers or prerogatives to lay down management policies and to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees or effectively recommend such managerial actions; the second class consists of cashiers, auditors, property custodians, etc.; they are defined as those who in the normal and routine exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property; "managerial employees refer to those whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed, or of a department or a subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff." (Id.)


- Casco explains the concept of loss of trust and confidence as a valid ground for termination of employment: Loss of trust and confidence as a valid ground for dismissal is premised on the fact that the employee holds a position whose functions may only be performed by someone who enjoys the trust and confidence of the management; such employee bears a greater burden of trustworthiness than ordinary workers, and the betrayal of the trust reposed is the essence of the loss of trust and confidence that becomes the basis for the employee's dismissal. (Id.)

Misconduct 
- Misconduct has been defined as an improper or wrong conduct; "it is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment"; for misconduct or improper behavior to be a just cause for dismissal, there must be a concurrence of the following elements: (a) the misconduct must be serious; (b) it must relate to the performance of the employee's duties showing that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer; and (c) it must have been performed with wrongful intent. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Misconduct involves the transgression of some established and definite rule or action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment; for misconduct to be serious and therefore a valid ground for dismissal, it must be (a) of grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial or unimportant, (b) connected with the work of the employee such that the latter has become unfit to continue working for the employer, and (c) performed with wrongful intent; here, respondents failed to show that Roxas's filing of the complaints for constructive dismissal against the company was impelled by any ill-motive amounting to gross misconduct. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

Neglect of duty 
- "Neglect of duty, as a ground for dismissal, must be both gross and habitual"; in Casco, We pronounced that: Gross negligence implies a want or absence of or a failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care; it evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them; habitual neglect implies repeated failure to perform one's duties for a period of time, depending upon the circumstances. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)

Preventive suspension 
- Placing an employee under preventive suspension is allowed under Section 8, Rule XXIII, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, as amended; preventive suspension is not a penalty but a disciplinary measure to protect life or property of the employer or the co-workers pending investigation of any alleged infraction committed by the employee; thus, it is justified only when the employee's continued employment poses a serious and imminent threat to the employer's or co-workers' life or property; when justified, the preventively suspended employee is not entitled to the payment of his salaries and benefits for the period of suspension; Dela Cruz's preventive suspension was justified considering that, as branch manager, she had unlimited access to the Calamba branch's finances, property, and records; as Dela Cruz herself admitted, she managed the Calamba branch as if she were the owner thereof. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

Procedural due process 
- The respondent SPC was shown to have afforded petitioners their right to due process; in termination proceedings or employees, procedural due process consists of the twin requirements of notice and hearing; the employer is required to furnish the employees with two written notices before the termination of employment can be effected: (1) the first apprises the employees of the particular acts or omissions for which their dismissal is sought; and (2) the second informs the employees of the employer's decision to dismiss them; there is compliance with the requirement of a hearing as long as there was an opportunity to be heard, and not necessarily that an actual hearing was conducted; here, petitioners were issued show cause notices and were made to explain; they were then subjected to investigation wherein they were given the opportunity to defend themselves; thereafter, respondent SPC found them guilty of the charges and issued notices of dismissal; considering respondent SPC's compliance with procedural due process, there is no other logical conclusion than that petitioners' dismissal was valid. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Recomputation of backwages 
- The final and executory decision referred to by complainants pertain to the May 26, 2000 Decision of the CA, which had been affirmed by this Court on June 20, 2001; a corresponding Entry of Judgment was issued on September 13, 2001 as to this adjudication; by redefining the scope of backwages which only included their salaries, complainants claim that the CA varied the terms of the original judgment; ascertaining the scope of backwages involves a recomputation thereof; it has long been settled that no essential change is made by a recomputation as this step is a necessary consequence that flows from the nature of the illegality of dismissal declared in that decision; by the nature of an illegal dismissal case, the reliefs continue to add on until full satisfaction thereof; the recomputation of the awards stemming from an illegal dismissal case does not constitute an alteration or amendment of the final decision being implemented. (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Redundancy —There is no dispute that petitioner was separated from service due to redundancy pursuant to Article 283 of the Labor Code; as she was dismissed due to redundancy, she is entitled to receive, under the law, a separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay for every year of her service. (Mateo vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc., G.R. 226064, Feb. 17, 2020)

Retrenchment 
- Article 283 of the Labor Code requires the employer to serve a written notice on the workers and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) at least one (1) month before the intended date of retrenchment; in case of retrenchment, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; the retrenchment of complainants was found to be bona fide but the required notices were evidently lacking; the purpose of a written notice under Article 283 of the Labor Code is to give employees time to prepare for the eventual loss of their jobs as well as to give the DOLE the opportunity to ascertain the veracity of the alleged cause of termination; here, there was no actual notice of termination; BATELEC II merely assumed that complainants knew about the retrenchment when they actively participated in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter who tackled the validity of the reorganization; the offer to pay separation pay is not sufficient to replace the formal requirement of written notice; at the time the reorganization took place, complainants were reinstated on payroll so they were deemed employees of BATELEC II; there was no reason why BATELEC II could not have served them notice of retrenchment before actually dismissing them; pursuant to Serrano which the appellate court hesitantly applied, complainants were entitled to separation pay and backwages up to September 13, 2001; however, in the subsequent cases of Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission and Jaka Food Processing Corporation v. Pacot, the Court now orders payment of nominal damages for valid dismissals due to just or authorized cause but not compliant to statutory due process; no reason why the Court should not apply Jaka retroactively in this case too; pursuant to Jaka, we direct BATELEC II to pay only indemnity in the amount of 50,000.00 each to all complainants; finally, complainants are entitled to legal interest; pursuant to Nacar v. Gallery Frames, the rate of legal interest shall be 6 percent  per annum computed from the date of the promulgation of this judgment until fully paid. (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Secular matters 
- The matter of terminating an employee, which is purely secular in nature, is different from the ecclesiastical act of expelling a member from the religious congregation; petitioners insist that this case is an ecclesiastical affair as there is no employer-employee relationship between BSAABC/MBIS and respondent; in order to settle the issue, it is imperative to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship; it was previously ruled that "in an illegal dismissal case, the onus probandi rests on the employer to prove that its dismissal of an employee was for a valid cause; however, before a case for illegal dismissal can prosper, an employer-employee relationship must first be established; thus, in filing a complaint before the LA for illegal dismissal, based on the premise that he was an employee of petitioners, it is incumbent upon respondent to prove the employer-employee relationship by substantial evidence." (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Separation pay 
- Having failed to establish by substantial evidence the just causes for Roxas's termination, it was error for the CA to not find grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in holding that the dismissal was valid; Article 294 of the Labor Code provides that an employee who is unjustly dismissed from work is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him, which in this case is reckoned from the time of his illegal dismissal on July 21, 2015, up to the time of his actual reinstatement; however, if reinstatement is no longer possible, the employer has the option of paying the employee his separation pay in lieu of reinstatement; considering the length of time that had passed since the controversy started and the existing regulation on the use of buses that has affected respondents' operations, there is a need to remand the case to the NLRC to determine if Roxas's reinstatement, as consistently prayed for, is still viable under the circumstances. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Since there is no illegal dismissal nor abandonment to speak of here, the logical step would have been to allow respondent to resume his position as Associate Area Sales Manager for South Luzon; as it was, respondent's reinstatement is no longer feasible because of the parties' strained relation; in case the reinstatement is no longer feasible, as in this case, an award of separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, is justified; the Court has ruled that reinstatement is no longer feasible: (a) when the former position of the illegally dismissed employee no longer exists; or (b) when the employer's business has closed down; or (c) when the employer-employee relationship has already been strained as to render the reinstatement impossible; the Court likewise considered reinstatement to be non-feasible because a "considerable time" has lapsed between the dismissal and the resolution of the case. (JS Unitrade Merchandise, Inc. vs. Samson, Jr., G.R. 200405, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The CA found, and this Court agrees, that reinstatement is no longer feasible, and thus separation pay in lieu of reinstatement is in order; this Court is not unaware that under the law and prevailing jurisprudence, an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement as a matter of right; however, if reinstatement would only aggravate the tension and strained relations between the parties, or where the relationship between the employer and the employee has been unduly strained by reason of their irreconcilable differences, it would be more prudent to order payment of separation pay instead of reinstatement. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)

Serious misconduct 
- It cannot be said that the penalty of dismissal is commensurate to Llorente's act of disobedience; however, viewed with the charge of serious misconduct, termination is justified under the circumstances; the records of the case are also replete with evidence of Llorente's past infractions, which the Court deemed no longer necessary to discuss, as these were not included by MPI in the Memorandum and the Notice of Termination served to Llorente; these are indicative of Llorente's unbecoming behavior at work and wanton disregard of his employment with MPI. (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Llorente's actuations of copying a patient's personal information and using it to malign MPI by relaying a false narrative are indicative of his wrongful intent; his actions comprise serious misconduct because as a nursing attendant, he has access to private and confidential information of MPI's patients, but he did not only illicitly copy the personal information of a patient of MPI, he also used the information to fulfill a deceit purpose; thus, MPI is justified in terminating the employment of Llorente. (Id.)

Voluntary resignation and constructive dismissal 
- In Saudi Arabian Airlines v. Rebesencio, this Court differentiated between voluntary resignation and constructive dismissal: In Bilbao v. Saudi Arabian Airlines, this court defined voluntary resignation as "the voluntary act of an employee who is in a situation where one believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service, and one has no other choice but to dissociate oneself from employment; it is a formal pronouncement or relinquishment of an office, with the intention of relinquishing the office accompanied by the act of relinquishment"; essential to the act of resignation is voluntariness; it must be the result of an employee's exercise of his or her own will; on the other hand, constructive dismissal has been defined as "cessation of work because ‘continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay' and other benefits." (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

Willful disobedience or insubordination 
- Llorente's refusal to heed the directives of the nursing attendant head, by itself, is insufficient to warrant his termination from employment; for dismissal to be valid under this ground, the following must be present: (a) there must be disobedience or insubordination; (b) the disobedience or insubordination must be willful or intentional characterized by a wrongful or perverse attitude; (c) the order violated must be reasonable, lawful, and made known to the employee; and (d) the order must pertain to the duties which he has been engaged to discharged. (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Neither can the Court subscribe to respondents' assertion that there was insubordination on the part of Roxas when he repeatedly refused to heed the company's directive to submit additional explanation as to why he filed his complaints; "willful disobedience or insubordination, as a just cause for the dismissal of an employee, necessitates the concurrence of at least two (2) requisites, namely: (a) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful, that is, characterized by a wrongful and perverse attitude; and (b) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee, and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge"; none of the foregoing requisites were present in the case at bar. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### EQUIPOISE RULE

Concept —The equipoise rule is inapplicable here; this criminal law principle is explained in brief in Tin v. People, a case relied on by Arriola: Under this rule, where the evidence on an issue of fact is in equipoise or there is doubt on which side the evidence preponderates, the party having the burden of proof loses; the equipoise rule finds application if the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, for then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty, and does not suffice to produce a conviction; briefly stated, the needed quantum of proof to convict the accused of the crime charged is found lacking; conviction rests not on the frailty of the defense but on the strength and sufficiency of the evidence of the prosecution; here, however, the scales of the evidence had already tilted heavily against the defense; We perceive no conflicting versions, as Arriola technically failed to set forth his own version in the first place; his guilt was finely established with the required quantum of proof, which is proof beyond reasonable doubt. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### ESTAFA BY MEANS OF FALSE PRETENSE OR DECEIT

Elements 
- As laid down by jurisprudence, the elements of Estafa by means of deceit under Article 315, Paragraph 2(a) of the RPC are as follows: (1) That there must be a false pretense or fraudulent representation as to the offender's power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business, or imaginary transactions; (2) That such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (3) That the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and (4) That, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)


- Rios was charged and convicted for eight counts of Estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the RPC, which provides for one of the modes of committing Estafa: 2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud: (a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits; the elements of Estafa by means of false pretenses or deceit were enumerated by the Court in Sy v. People: x x x (a) that there must be a false pretense or fraudulent representation as to his power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; (b) that such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (c) that the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and (d) that, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. In the instant cases, the element of false pretense or fraudulent representations is lacking. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The return by the accused of money belonging to the private complainant will not reverse a consummated act of Estafa; quite the contrary, such action may even uphold a conviction. Section 27, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court states that in criminal cases, except those involving quasi-offenses or criminal negligence or those allowed by law to be compromised, an offer of compromise by the accused may be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt; here, Arriola's initial attempts to reimburse Del Rosario through checks, coupled with the actual return of the latter's money after the RTC issued its judgment of conviction, may all be considered as unequivocal gestures to compromise and which can be measured against Arriola as his implied admission of guilt. (Id.)

Fraud and deceit 
- As defined in People v. Balasa: Fraud, in its general sense, is deemed to comprise anything calculated to deceive, including all acts, omissions, and concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence justly reposed, resulting in damage to another, or by which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another; it is a generic term embracing all multifarious means which human ingenuity can device, and which are resorted to by one individual to secure an advantage over another by false suggestions or by suppression of truth and includes all surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling and any unfair way by which another is cheated; on the other hand, deceit is the false representation of a matter of fact whether by words or conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed which deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Good faith as a defense 
- Good faith is "an elusive idea, taking on different meanings and emphases as we move from one context to another"; it is, in general, a state of mind consisting in honesty in belief or purpose, faithfulness to one's duty or obligation, observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business, absence of intent to defraud or seek unconscionable advantage, or a belief in one's legal title or right; being malum in se, and depending on the proven circumstances, good faith and lack of criminal intent are indeed available defenses against a prosecution for Estafa; however, all-encompassing this definition is, good faith still cannot be appreciated in favor of Arriola. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Penalty 
- R.A. 10951 adjusted the amount or value of the property and damage upon which the penalties for crimes and offenses are based, and the fines imposed therefor; Section 85 thereof specifically provides for violations of Article 315, Paragraph 2(a) of the RPC: . . . In light of RA 10951 and the recent pronouncements (Seguritan v. People and People v. Dejolde, Jr.), Arriola's penalty is hereby modified to arresto mayor in its minimum period to prision correccional in its minimum period, further narrowed down to an indeterminate penalty of two (2) months and one (1) day of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional, as maximum. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### EVIDENCE

Admissibility of 
- This Court sustains the RTC ruling that even if the subject ink cartridges are admitted as evidence, it does not necessarily follow that they are given probative weight; this Court held in Mancol, Jr. v. Development Bank of the Philippines that: admissibility of evidence should not be confused with its probative value; the admissibility of evidence depends on its relevance and competence, while the weight of evidence pertains to evidence already admitted and its tendency to convince and persuade; the admissibility of a particular item of evidence has to do with whether it meets various tests by which its reliability is to be determined, so as to be considered with other evidence admitted in the case in arriving at a decision as to the truth; the weight of evidence is not determined mathematically by the numerical superiority of the witnesses testifying to a given fact, but depends upon its practical effect in inducing belief on the part of the judge trying the case; "admissibility refers to the question of whether certain pieces of evidence are to be considered at all, while probative value refers to the question of whether the admitted evidence proves an issue"; "thus, a particular item of evidence may be admissible, but its evidentiary weight depends on judicial evaluation within the guidelines provided by the rules of evidence." (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)

Circumstantial evidence 
- Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: (a) There is more than one circumstance; (b) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt; circumstantial evidence may support a conviction if they afford as basis for a reasonable inference of the existence of the fact thereby sought to be proved; to sustain a conviction based on circumstantial evidence, it is essential that the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain, which leads one to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of the others, as the guilty person; the circumstantial evidence must exclude the possibility that some other person has committed the crime. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

Hearsay rule 
- Section 36, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court does declare hearsay as generally inadmissible testimonial evidence: Section 36. Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded. 
- A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception; evidence is called hearsay when its probative force depends, in whole or in part, on the competency and credibility of some persons other than the witness by whom it is sought to produce it; a person who introduces a hearsay statement is not obliged to enter into any particular stipulation, to answer any question, to solve any difficulties, to reconcile any contradictions, to explain any obscurities, to remove any ambiguities; and that he/she entrenches himself/herself in the simple assertion that he/she was told so, and leaves the burden entirely upon the dead or absent author; the hearsay rule, however, does not apply to independently relevant statements; People v. Umapas is instructive on the matter: [W]hile the testimony of a witness regarding a statement made by another person given for the purpose of establishing the truth of the fact asserted in the statement is clearly hearsay evidence, it is otherwise if the purpose of placing the statement on the record is merely to establish the fact that the statement, or the tenor of such statement, was made; regardless of the truth or falsity of a statement, when what is relevant is the fact that such statement has been made, the hearsay rule does not apply and the statement may be shown; as a matter of fact, evidence as to the making of the statement is not secondary but primary, for the statement itself may constitute a fact in issue or is circumstantially relevant as to the existence of such a fact. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Preponderance of evidence 
- In civil cases, like in a complaint for a sum of money, the burden of proof lies on the party who asserts the affirmative of the issue; in such a case, the party, whether plaintiff or defendant, must establish his case by preponderance of evidence; preponderance of evidence is the weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be synonymous with the term "greater weight of evidence" or "greater weight of the credible evidence"; preponderance of evidence is a phrase, which, in the last analysis, means probability of truth; it is that evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthier of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto; further, preponderance of evidence is determined by considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, culled from the evidence, regardless of who actually presented it. (Spouses Garcia, doing business under the name and style of Ecolamp Multi-Resources vs. Northern Islands, Co., Inc., G.R. 226495, Feb. 5, 2020) 


- The Court finds that respondent Northern proved its cause of action by preponderance of evidence; as aptly found by the CA, the goods delivered and received in April to July 2004 created an obligation on the part of Ecolamp to pay respondent Northern as it fell due; here, however, petitioner Spouses Garcia failed to present evidence to prove payment thereof; deliveries to Ecolamp having been established by preponderance of evidence, the CA did not err in ordering petitioner Spouses to pay respondent Northern the value of the 3D appliances in the amount of P6,478,700.00 as shown by the various delivery cargo receipts the details of which correspond to the details found in the bills of lading; the Court finds the CA's imposition of 12 percent  interest per annum from date of last extrajudicial demand on May 4, 2005 until June 30, 2013, and 6 percent  per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of this Decision in place; thereafter, the principal amount due as adjusted by interest shall likewise earn an interest at 6 percent  per annum until its full satisfaction. (Id.)

Substantial evidence 
- Every person has the right to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; considering the gravity of the consequences of the disbarment or suspension of a lawyer, the Court has consistently ruled that a lawyer enjoys the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof rests upon the complainant to satisfactorily prove the allegations in his/her complaint through substantial evidence; time and again, the Court has held that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof; while the Court agrees with the recommendation of the IBP-BOG to dismiss the disbarment complaint; the quantum of proof in administrative cases is substantial evidence and not preponderance of evidence; this issue had already been clarified in Reyes v. Nieva where the Court held that: Besides, the evidentiary threshold of substantial evidence 
- as opposed to preponderance of evidence 
- is more in keeping with the primordial purpose of and essential considerations attending this type of cases; as case law elucidates, "disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are sui generis; neither purely civil nor purely criminal, they do not involve a trial of an action or a suit, but is rather an investigation by the Court into the conduct of one of its officers." (Spouses Nocuenca vs. Atty. Bensi, A.C. No. 12609, Feb. 10, 2020)


- It appears that the CA overlooked that "the quantum of proof required in determining the legality of an employee's dismissal is only substantial evidence," which is "that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion"; aside from the CCTV footage where Llorente was seen copying from the records and pocketing the paper where he wrote the information, Nurses Dumalanta and Manawat submitted their written statements avowing that they recognized Llorente's voice on the speaker phone as the latter talked to Tan's mother; these circumstances constitute substantial evidence of Llorente's wrongdoing; the Court reiterates that "as opposed to the ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt' standard of evidence required in criminal cases, labor suits require only substantial evidence to prove the validity of the dismissal"; "the standard of substantial evidence is satisfied where the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee is responsible for the misconduct and his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position." (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- It is fundamental that the quantum of proof in administrative cases such as disbarment proceedings is substantial evidence; substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds, equally reasonable, might conceivably opine otherwise; while Zamora is correct that the very pleading itself is the best piece of evidence to prove whether Atty. Mahinay had, indeed, violated Canon 11, Rule 11.03 of the CPR, this proffered evidence failed to reach the threshold of the quantum of proof required; the Court does not find the language used in the subject motion for reconsideration to be offensive, abusive, malicious, or intemperate in any way; it did not spill over the walls of decency or propriety. (Zamora vs. Atty. Mahinay, A.C. No. 12622, Feb. 10, 2020 [Formerly CBD Case No. 15-4651])


- Suicide had been indubitably established; technical rules of procedure are not binding in labor cases, and the quantum of proof required here is only substantial evidence, defined as "that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion"; while it may be true that the documentary evidence adduced by respondents were photocopies, the Court cannot discount the fact that the statements of the crew members of the vessel as well as the autopsy report issued by the Sri Lankan authority coincide with the NBI autopsy report which concluded that the cause of death to be "consistent with asphyxia by ligature"; the NBI autopsy report lends credence to and bolsters the account of the respondents that Manuel took his own life. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### EVIDENCE CUSTODIAN

Duties 
- Equally accountable with Atty. Toledo was Barcelona who also failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence in performing her duties as evidence custodian; Barcelona did not observe such diligence required under the circumstances when she ordered Esguerra to simply place the shabu evidence under her computer table, in total disregard of its legal value as the very corpus delicti of the offense; all that is needed in the safekeeping of court evidence or property is the exercise of ordinary prudence and common sense, which Barcelona obviously failed to do; even without a specific instruction from anyone, common sense should have impelled Barcelona to list down the physical evidence received by the court for its safekeeping inclusive of the vital details pertaining thereto such as the date and time of reception and the identity of the person who handed the evidence to her. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)

#### EXEMPTING CIRCUMSTANCES

Irresistible force and/or uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury 
- To avail of the exempting circumstance of " irresistible force and/or uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury", the evidence must establish: (1) the existence of an uncontrollable fear; (2) that the fear must be real and imminent; and (3) the fear of an injury is greater than or at least equal to that committed; a threat of future injury is insufficient; the compulsion must be of such a character as to leave no opportunity for the accused to escape. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### FORUM SHOPPING

Commission of 
- Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, cited; by filing with the Panel a second motion for reconsideration in the guise of a Manifestation with Opposition, and without awaiting the result thereof, appealing before the CA, and thereafter filing once again with the Panel a Reiterative Motion, petition avers that respondents committed forum shopping; while the Court agrees with the petitioner that respondents' Manifestation with Opposition is in reality a second motion for reconsideration and its Reiterative Motion is another motion for reconsideration, there are good reasons which militate against the finding of forum shopping in this case; the Manifestation with Opposition, being a second motion for reconsideration, and the Reiterative Motion, being technically a third motion for reconsideration, their filing thereof is prohibited under Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Civil Procedure; regarded as mere scrap of paper that do not deserve any consideration and do not have any legal effect; in addition, the Reiterative Motion is no longer within the Panel's competence to decide; thus, no forum shopping in this case. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT REFORM ACT (R.A. 9184)

Invitation to apply for eligibility and to bid (IAEB) 
- Section 21 of R.A. 9184 mandates that the procuring entity, in this case the Municipality of Looc, shall cause the advertisement of the invitation to bid, thus: SEC. 21. Advertising and Contents of the Invitation to Bid. – In line with the principle of transparency and competitiveness, all Invitations to Bid for contracts under competitive bidding shall be advertised by the Procuring Entity; R.A. 9184 intends to reach the broadest number of prospective participants to join the public bidding; this is in line with the law's policy of promoting transparency and competitiveness during the entire bidding process. (Jomadiao, et al. vs. Arboleda, G.R. 230322, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The duty of publication falls upon the BAC Secretariat, and his or her certification as to the fact of posting refutes allegations to the contrary; the petitioners, as provisional BAC members, are not responsible for the actual posting of the IAEB and the corresponding payment, if any, of the same; be that as it may, the Court is of the view that allowing a prospective bidder to pay for any advertisement or publication will not give him or her a leverage in public bidding; such act is actually against any bidder's interest because it publicizes the existence of a bidding and persuades competition; on the issue of non-posting of the IAEB on the PhilGeps website, respondent did not show that the Municipality of Looc had an electronic registry with the PhilGeps nor that it had access to the internet; since the viability of posting on the PhilGeps website had not been duly proven during trial, the Court could not postulate on the assumption that the lack of posting on PhilGeps was deliberate; nonetheless, the BAC still fell short in the publication requirement when it failed to advertise the IAEB in a newspaper of general nationwide circulation, or a newspaper that is published nationally; the minutes of the meeting uncovers that the BAC acceded to forego publication in a newspaper of general nationwide circulation because the breakdown per project was below P5,000,000.00; this reveals that the BAC was still ascribing to the posting requirements of R.A. 1594, or otherwise known as Prescribing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for Government Infrastructure Contracts; this has already been superseded by Section 21.2.3 and its IRR-A; yet, the BAC gave an incorrect interpretation of the law because the easing of the posting requirement refers to contracts that are below P5,000,000.00; the SWIP contract was for the entire amount of P9,000,000.00 and it was without regard to the value of the infrastructure project per barangay. (Id.)

Requirement of a valid bid security 
- The basic rule in public bidding that bids should be evaluated on the basis of the required documents submitted before and not after the opening of bids must be strictly observed in order to safeguard a fair, honest and competitive public bidding; a bid security is one of the documents that Section 25.3 and its IRR-A mandates to be included at the opening of bids; a reading of the Bidder's Bond would show that it satisfied the required form of a Bid Security as provided for in Sections 27.2, 27.3 and 28 and its IRR-A which must be: (a) two and a half percent (2½ percent ) of the approved budget for the contract to be bid; (b) callable upon demand issued by a reputable surety or insurance company; (c) in Philippine Peso; and (d) not valid for more than 120 days from the opening of the bid; furthermore, the Bidder's Bond was notarized on November 11, 2007 which contradicts the complaint and the finding of the Ombudsman; hence, the BAC did not err in accepting the bid offer of R.G. Florentino because the bid security shows that it had been issued regularly and for purposes only of securing R.G. Florentino's performance on the SWIP; the Court cannot contradict the BAC's finding on record that a Bid Security was included in the technical proposal during the opening of bids and, thus, upholds its presumption of regularity. (Jomadiao, et al. vs. Arboleda, G.R. 230322, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT UNDER R.A. 8042

Concept 
- Under Article 38 of the Labor Code, Illegal Recruitment is defined as any act of recruitment undertaken by unlicensed or unauthorized persons; with the amendments introduced by R.A. 8042, Illegal Recruitment may be committed even by POEA-licensed recruiters or agencies, who commit any of the prohibited acts under Section 6 of R.A. 8042; the Court notes that R.A. 8042 was amended on March 8, 2010 by R.A. 10022 or An Act Amending R.A. 8042; however, as the acts in this case were committed in 2007-2008, R.A. 8042 is the relevant law that applies; herein accused Rios was charged and convicted of the Illegal Recruitment as penalized under Section 6(m) of the law: Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042 pertains to Illegal Recruitment committed through the failure of any person (whether or not a holder of license or authority) to reimburse documentation and processing expenses incurred by the worker when the deployment did not occur without the worker's fault; this provision also defines Syndicated Illegal Recruitment as being committed by three or more persons and Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale as being committed against three or more persons; Rios was convicted in her capacity as president and general manager of Green Pastures, Inc.; while corporate officers are generally not held personally liable for corporate acts as corporations have separate and distinct legal personality from the persons comprising it, they may be found liable when a specific provision of law makes them personally liable for a corporate action; this is the case here as the last paragraph of Section 6 of R.A. 8042 specifically provides that when Illegal Recruitment is committed by a juridical entity, the persons liable shall be the officers having control, management or direction of the business; Heirs of Fe Tan Uy v. International Exchange Bank, cited. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

Conviction 
- As the main element of false pretense is lacking, the Court acquits Rios of the offense and the penalty therefor is deleted; while it is settled jurisprudence that a person may be separately charged and convicted with Illegal Recruitment under R.A. 8042 and Estafa under Article 315(2), for the same acts, conviction is not automatic as the said crimes have different elements; in the same manner, a conviction for Illegal Recruitment does not automatically result to a conviction for Estafa; the prosecution must still prove the elements of the offense; moreover, in Estafa through deceit or false pretenses, the fraud must have been executed prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud; in this case, Rios and her agency had the qualifications and capacity to deploy workers abroad; the offense she committed was in her failure to reimburse the documentation and processing expenses incurred by the applicants when they were not deployed without their fault; unfortunately for accused Rios, the acquittal for Estafa has no bearing on her sentence as the penalty for Large Scale Illegal Recruitment under Section 7(b) is Life Imprisonment. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

Elements of illegal recruitment through failure to reimburse documentation and processing expenses 
- Based on the language of Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042, the elements of Illegal Recruitment through failure to reimburse documentation and processing expenses, are: 1. The offender (whether or not a POEA-licensed or authorized recruiter or agency), promises or gives the distinct impression that he or she has the capacity to deploy workers for employment abroad; 2. The applicant pays money to the offender in connection with documentation and processing fees for purposes of deployment; 3. The deployment does not take place without the applicant's fault; and 4. The offender fails to reimburse the documentation and processing expenses incurred by the applicant; the Court affirms Rios' conviction for Large Scale Illegal Recruitment under Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042 committed against Tiglao, Dacillo, Milanes, Papio and Custodio; as regards the offense purportedly committed by Rios against complainants De Mata, Arevalo and Agcaoili, the Court holds that Rios' guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt; Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042 criminalizes the failure to reimburse documentation and processing expenses incurred by the applicant in case of non-deployment, and not the failure to deploy, which is covered by a different provision; the law thus makes it incumbent upon recruitment agencies, under pain of criminal sanction, to promptly reimburse applicants when they are not deployed without their fault, as it is the agency itself that knows of the schedule of deployment, persons to be deployed, failure to deploy, and the reasons therefor; the lack of official receipts is not fatal to prove the existence of Illegal Recruitment as long as there is testimony from convincing and credible witnesses, as in this case; the duty to issue official receipts is on the recruitment agency and the recruiter's failure to issue receipts should not be taken against the applicants or claimants. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### INFORMATION

Designation of the offense 
- Going now to the ordinary aggravating circumstance of dwelling; Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court is in consonance with the constitutional rights of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him; the purpose is to allow the accused to fully prepare for his defense, precluding surprises during the trial; even if the prosecution has duly proven the presence of any of these circumstances, the Court cannot appreciate the same if they were not alleged in the Information, as in here; that the killing happened in the victim's dwelling was not alleged in the Information; hence, the trial court and the Court of Appeals cannot appreciate dwelling as an aggravating circumstance. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)

Sufficiency of allegations 
- Under Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the Information is sufficient if it contains the full name of the accused, the designation of the offense given by the statute, the acts or omissions constituting the offense, the name of the offended party, the approximate date, as well as the place of the offense; the Information herein complied with these conditions since the qualifying circumstance of "treachery" was specifically alleged in the Information; accused-appellant never claimed that he was deprived of his right to be fully apprised of the nature of the charges against him due to the insufficiency of the Information. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### INTERPLEADER

Filing of 
- Here, since both petitioner and the Cooperative claimed entitlement to the withheld amount of P1,400,000.00, respondent appropriately filed a Complaint for Interpleader with Consignation before Branch 55 of the RTC of Mandaue City; under Section 1, Rule 62 of the Rules of Court, a person may file a special civil action for Interpleader if conflicting claims are made against him/her/it over a subject matter in which he/she/it has no interest; the action is brought against the claimants to compel them to litigate their claims among themselves; the interpleader case before the RTC was filed prior to petitioner's filing of his complaint before the LA; the fact that respondent filed the interpleader case is even an indication of good faith on its part as both petitioner and the Cooperative would be given the right to have their respective claims ventilated before the court; contrarily, the Cooperative who is not a party to the labor complaint before the LA would not have the opportunity to oppose or refute petitioner's unilateral claims therein; in addition, the fact that respondent had consigned the amount of P1,400,000.00 in the RTC where the interpleader case was pending demonstrates the lack of intention on its part to deprive petitioner of such amount, if he was indeed the one entitled to it; given that the disputed sum of P1,400,000.00 pertained to the alleged outstanding loan obligation of petitioner to the Cooperative, it was necessary that all documents pertinent thereto, most especially the loan agreement itself, be presented before the adjudicating body, assessed, and taken into consideration in determining who is entitled to the amount contested. (Tumaodos vs. San Miguel Yamamura Packaging Corporation, G.R. 241865, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### JUDGES

Conduct of 
- Members of the judiciary should conduct themselves in such a manner as to be beyond reproach and suspicion, and free from any appearance of impropriety in their personal behavior, not only in the discharge of their official duties but also in their everyday life; they are strictly mandated to maintain good moral character at all times and to observe irreproachable behavior so as not to outrage public decency. (Baculi vs. Judge Belen, Regional Trial Court, Branch 36, Calamba City, Laguna, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2286 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3291-RTJ], Feb. 12, 2020)

Delay in disposition of cases 
- Because of Judge Santos' overbearing persistence to make the parties settle amicably, he has unduly hampered the proceedings in Special Proceedings No. 1870; in Re: Report on the Judicial Audit conducted in the RTC, Branch 9, Silay City, the Court found Judge Arinday, Jr. guilty of gross inefficiency because of the delay he incurred in disposing of the cases assigned to him and which were already submitted for decision; in two of the cases where he incurred delay, the Court ruled that Judge Arinday was too liberal in granting the parties more than one year to amicably settle their dispute; while the Judge Arinday case involved a delay in the disposition of the cases which were already submitted for decision, the Court finds the pronouncement in the same applicable in determining the reasonableness of the delay in Special Proceedings No. 1870; as correctly pointed out by the OCA, the case went on from January 7, 2010 to December 11, 2012 when the petition was finally withdrawn without it proceeding beyond the pre-trial stage; while a few delays were attributable to the parties due to the absence of counsel, the filing of motion for postponement, and change of counsel, the Court finds that based on Judge Santos' actuations spanning around almost three years, it was mainly his overbearing desire to convince the parties to arrive at an amicable settlement that led to the unreasonable delay; while the Court does not find any bad faith or ill motive on the part of Judge Santos in pushing for an amicable settlement, this should not get in the way of arriving at a just and speedy disposition of the litigants' conflicting claims. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur., A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

Dishonesty 
- Respondent judge is indeed guilty of dishonest conduct; jurisprudence defines dishonesty as "a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray"; in receiving his monthly allowances despite notice of his suspension by the Court, respondent judge knowingly received money not due to him and in effect defrauded the LGUs concerned of public funds that could have been used for a worthy governmental purpose; under civil service rules, a government employee is not entitled to all monetary benefits including leave credits during the period of suspension; the seriousness of respondent's offense lies in the fact that as a judge, he was "expected to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural rules and to apply them properly in all good faith"; worse, his act of receiving allowances was in clear contravention of this Court's decision suspending him for six (6) months without salary or benefits; We approve the penalty recommended by the OCA since it is settled that "dishonesty, being in the nature of a grave offense, carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the government service." (Baculi vs. Judge Belen, Regional Trial Court, Branch 36, Calamba City, Laguna, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2286 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3291-RTJ], Feb. 12, 2020)

Dismissal of 
- All those who don the judicial robe must always instill in their minds the exhortation that the administration of justice is a mission; judges, from the lowest to the highest levels, are the gems in the vast government bureaucracy, beacon lights looked upon as the embodiments of all what is right, just and proper, the ultimate weapons against injustice and oppression; those who cannot meet the exacting standards of judicial conduct and integrity have no place in the judiciary; the investigating Justice deems it appropriate to recommend the imposition of an administrative penalty of dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits against the respondent judge; it becomes this Tribunal's bounden duty to decree respondent's dismissal from the service. (Neri, et al. vs. Judge Macabaya, Branch 20, Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental, A.M. No. RTJ-16-2475, Feb. 4, 2020 [Formerly A. M. No. 16-07-261-RTC])

Gross ignorance of the law and procedure 
- Gross ignorance of the law is a serious charge under Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC; it requires the judge to perform his/her duty to be acquainted with the basic legal command of law and rules; gross ignorance of the law is the disregard of basic rules and settled jurisprudence; a judge may also be administratively liable if shown to have been motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption in ignoring, contradicting or failing to apply settled law and jurisprudence; Andrada v. Hon. Emmanuel Banzon, cited. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)


- In Department of Justice v. Judge Mislang, the Court explained what constitutes gross ignorance of the law in this wise: Gross ignorance of the law is the disregard of basic rules and settled jurisprudence; a Judge may also be administratively liable if shown to have been motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption in ignoring, contradicting or failing to apply settled law and jurisprudence; though not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance of the law and that, if committed in good faith, does not warrant administrative sanction, the same applies only in cases within the parameters of tolerable misjudgment; where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law; a judge is presumed to have acted with regularity and good faith in the performance of judicial functions; but a blatant disregard of the clear and unmistakable provisions of a statute, as well as Supreme Court circulars enjoining their strict compliance, upends this presumption and subjects the magistrate to corresponding administrative sanctions; for liability to attach for ignorance of the law, the assailed order, decision or actuation of the judge in the performance of official duties must not only be found erroneous but, most importantly, it must also be established that he was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or some other like motive; when the inefficiency springs from a failure to recognize such a basic and elemental rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his functions, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the prestigious title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority; in both cases, the judge's dismissal will be in order. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur., A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])


- The Court finds Judge Santos guilty of gross ignorance of the law; Judge Santos' gross ignorance of the law lies not so much in the issuance of the Order dated August 7, 2012, which appeared to incorporate a pre-trial order; the Court finds that what appeared as a pre-trial order incorporated in the said Order is not final; in fact, after the pre-trial hearing, Judge Santos issued a Pre-trial Order dated September 4, 2012; however, Judge Santos committed a blatant error when in his Order dated August 7, 2012, he gave the oppositor the privilege of submitting at his option a pre-trial brief; this contravenes the expressed rule under Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court that the filing of the respective pre-trial briefs by the parties at least three days before the date of pre-trial is mandatory; worse, during the pre-trial hearing, Judge Santos expressed that in the absence of oppositor's pre-trial brief, he was treating oppositor's previous submissions to the court, i.e., Opposition, Supplement to the Opposition in lieu of Position Paper, and Compliance, as containing the elements of a pre-trial brief; Judge Santos' act of considering oppositor's submissions as his pre-trial brief is clearly not sanctioned by Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court which mandates the parties to file a pre-trial brief; Section 5 of the same Rule even provides that failure to file the pre-trial brief shall have the same effect as failure to appear at the pre-trial, which in turn will result to allowing the plaintiff to present his evidence ex parte and for the court to render judgment on the basis thereof; thus, when he issued the Pre-Trial Order dated September 4, 2012, Judge Santos disregarded the mandatory nature of the submission of pre-trial briefs considering that the oppositor did not submit his pre-trial brief; Judge Santos' lack of understanding of the rules on pre-trial, constitutes gross ignorance of the law and procedure. (Id.)


- The Court agrees with OCA that the following acts alone do not make Judge Santos' administratively liable: (1) advising the complainant to bring her co-heirs who were residing abroad before the court; (2) not limiting the case to the validity of the Deed of Donation Mortis Causa; and (3) requiring information on the lots which were not subject matter of the petition; these acts are judicial in nature and involved Judge Santos' appreciation of the probate case; in Salvador v. Judge Limsiaco, Jr., as cited in Magdadaro v. Judge Saniel, Jr., the Court ruled: It is settled that a judge's failure to interpret the law or to properly appreciate the evidence presented does not necessarily render him administratively liable; only judicial errors tainted with fraud, dishonesty, gross ignorance, bad faith, or deliberate intent to do an injustice will be administratively sanctioned; to hold otherwise would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment; complainant failed to show that Judge Santos' acts were motivated by bias or bad faith; the Court is also not convinced that such acts constitute gross ignorance of the law; assuming that Judge Santos erred in his appreciation of the case, the remedy of complainant should have been to assail them in an appropriate judicial proceeding where he could have corrected himself or could have been corrected by a higher court. (Id.)

Gross misconduct 
- Respondent Judge is found guilty of violating paragraph 7, Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (borrowing money from litigants in cases pending before his court) which is also a gross misconduct constituting violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct; under Section 8 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, it is a serious charge to borrow money or property from lawyers and litigants in a case pending before the court; under Section 11(A) of the same rule, an act that violates the Code of Judicial Conduct constitutes gross misconduct, which is also a serious charge; in either instance, a serious charge is punishable by (1) dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits; (2) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three but not exceeding six months; or (3) a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00. (Neri, et al. vs. Judge Macabaya, Branch 20, Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental, A.M. No. RTJ-16-2475, Feb. 4, 2020 [Formerly A. M. No. 16-07-261-RTC])

Guidelines in the imposition of penalties in administrative matters involving members of the Bench 
- In Boston Finance and Investment Corporation v. Judge Gonzalez, the Court set the following guidelines in the imposition of penalties in administrative matters involving members of the Bench and court personnel, thus: (a) Rule 140 of the Rules of Court shall exclusively govern administrative cases involving judges or justices of the lower courts; if the respondent judge or justice of the lower court is found guilty of multiple offenses under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each violations; and (b) The administrative liability of court personnel (who are not judges or justices of the lower courts) shall be governed by the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, which incorporates, among others, the civil service laws and rules; if the respondent court personnel is found guilty of multiple administrative offenses, the Court shall impose the penalty corresponding to the most serious charge, and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances; Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC of the Rules of Court, classifies the administrative charges against members of the Bench as serious, less serious and light; the corresponding penalties for a finding of guilt on any of these charges are provided in Section 11, Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

Propriety 
- As regards Judge Santos' issuance of the Extended Order, he again exceeded the bounds of propriety when he unduly castigated complainant's counsel; Judge Santos should have refrained from using his position to browbeat complainant's counsel just because he did not agree with the latter's position; further, he should have refrained from rendering the Extended Order considering that he already granted the withdrawal of the petition in Special Proceedings No. 1870; thus, there was no longer any occasion to issue the Extended Order. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])


- OCA Circular No. 70-2003 cautions judges "to avoid in chamber sessions without the other party and his counsel present, and to observe prudence at all times in their conduct to the end that they not only act impartially and with propriety but are also perceived to be impartial and improper"; A.M. No. 03-01-09 SC, which was adverted to by Judge Santos to justify his actions, mandates judges to persuade the parties to arrive at a settlement of the dispute; however, it does not give the judge an unbridled license to do this outside the confines of the official proceedings at the risk of putting into question the integrity of the judiciary; while he may have been impelled by good motives in encouraging the parties to arrive at an amicable settlement, his aforementioned acts particularly texting complainant's counsel and convincing the oppositor to amicably settle during their accidental meeting in Naga City, are not part of the court's official proceedings and thus, cast doubt on the integrity and impartiality of the courts; further, his ex parte meeting with complainant and her counsel done inside his chambers is specifically prohibited by OCA Circular No. 70-2003. (Id.)

Violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars 
- In Re: Anonymous Complaints against Judge Bandong, RTC, Br. 59, Lucena City, Quezon Province, the Court explained that to decongest court dockets and enhance access to justice, the Court, through A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA, approved the institutionalization of mediation in the Philippines through court-annexed mediation; under this set of rules, mediatable cases where amicable settlement is possible must be referred by the trial courts to the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC); here, the case involved a petition for the allowance of the Deed of Donation Mortis Causa, which is governed by the rules on the Settlement of Estate of Deceased Person under the Rules of Court; Judge Santos should have referred the case to the PMC but he failed to do so; no reason for him not to refer to the PMC Special Proceedings No. 1870. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

Violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars, simple misconduct, gross inefficiency or undue delay, and gross ignorance of the law 
- Judge Santos committed the following offenses: 1. Failure to refer the case to the PMC as prescribed in A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA; 2. Pressing the parties to enter into an amicable settlement through means that exceeded the bounds of propriety, i.e., texting complainant's counsel, conducting an ex parte meeting with complainant and her counsel inside his chambers, and convincing the oppositor to settle amicably during their accidental meeting in Naga City; 3. Causing undue delay in terminating the preliminary conference amounting to gross inefficiency; 4. Issuing the Extended Order unduly castigating complainant's counsel after the withdrawal of the petition, thereby exceeding the bounds of propriety; and 5. Giving the oppositor the option of submitting his pre-trial brief in contravention of its mandatory nature as stated in Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court; Judge Santos' first second, and third offenses are less serious charges; specifically, the first offense constitutes a violation of Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars under Section 9(4), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; the second offense amount to simple misconduct under Section 9(7), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, there being no corrupt or wrongful motive on the part of Judge Santos; the third offense which amounts to gross inefficiency or undue delay falls under Section 9(1), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; applying Section 11, Rule 140, the Court deems it proper to impose a penalty of P12,000.00 each for the first and third offenses; as to the second offense, the Court previously found Judge Santos in A.M. No. MTJ-15-1850 guilty of violating Section 2, Canon 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for initiating a conference among the parties in a pending case for the purpose of settling the cases pending not only before him but also those pending outside his sala; maximum penalty of P20,000.00; as to the fourth charge, the Court finds it as not attended by corrupt or wrongful motive on the part of Judge Santos in issuing the Extended Order; it only amounts to simple misconduct which is a less serious charge under Section 9(7), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; penalty of P12,000.00; the fifth offense constitutes gross ignorance of the law under Section 8(9), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court which is a serious charge; applying Section 11, Rule 140, the Court deems it proper to impose the penalty of P22,000.00. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

#### JUDGMENTS

Final and executory judgment 
- A judgment sought to be revived is one that is already final and executory; therefore, it is conclusive as to the controversy between the parties up to the time of its rendition; otherwise stated, the new action is an action the purpose of which is not to reexamine and retry issues already decided but to revive the judgment; the cause of action of the petition for revival is the judgment to be revived, i.e., the cause of action is the decision itself and not the merits of the action upon which the judgment sought to be enforced is rendered. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

Immutability of final judgment 
- As a rule, a final judgment is immutable and unalterable; it cannot be disturbed or modified by any court even if the purpose of the alteration is to rectify perceived errors of fact or law; the doctrine of immutability of judgment is for the purpose of avoiding delay in the administration of justice and of putting an end to judicial controversies which cannot drag perpetually; pursuant to this doctrine, courts have the ministerial duty to enforce judgment that already attained finality; there are established exceptions to the foregoing rule, namely: (i) the correction of clerical errors; (ii) presence of nunc pro tunc entries, which cause no prejudice to any party; (iii) void judgment; and, (iv) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the judgment which renders the execution unjust and inequitable; here, none of the foregoing exceptions is applicable; the assailed RTC Order which granted petitioner's application for writ of possession had already become final and executory; the RTC had in fact already issued the corresponding entry of judgment. (HH & Co. Agricultural Corporation vs. Perlas, G.R. 217095, Feb. 12, 2020)


- It is settled that when a decision has acquired finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable; public policy also dictates that when a judgment becomes final, executory, and unappealable, the prevailing party should not be denied the fruits of his or her victory through any form of subterfuge which may be devised by the losing party; "unjustified delay in the enforcement of a judgment sets at naught the role of courts in disposing justiciable controversies with finality". (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Since the Deed of Sale of Residential House was declared null and void in Civil Case No. 12-128721 and affirmed in CA-G.R. CV No. 107254, which decision has attained finality during the pendency of this case, Domingo can no longer claim any right to possess the subject property based on the said deed of sale; this issue has already been settled and can no longer be disturbed in this case; it is a general rule that "judgments by a court of competent jurisdiction, which have attained finality, are not subject to reversal, modification or alteration and are, thus, immutable"; doctrine was extensively discussed in Vios v. Pantango, Jr. (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### JUSTICES

Administrative complaint against Court of Appeals Associate Justices 
- Villamin and Balce point out in their complaint that the two resolutions of the CA were prepared with the same font, paging, and format; they allege that the timing of the resolutions' release of being four (4) days apart connote bias and collusion among the two divisions; such allegation of bias is unfounded, highly speculative and is, clearly, not supported by substantial evidence; the Court reiterates that the filing of administrative complaints or just the threat of the filing of such complaints do subvert and undermine the independence of the Judiciary and its Judges; the Court does not tolerate such unwarranted allegations which spawn as administrative complaints brought against sitting magistrates in respect of their judicial actions; to permit such administrative complaint against members of the second highest court of the land on the basis of such unwarranted allegations is to sanction a clear affront on the independence of the Judiciary; Villamin and Balce are not even parties to Tallado's case pending before the CA; they filed the present administrative complaint as officers of the Volunteer against Crime and Corruption, seeking that the CA Associate Justices inhibit themselves from deciding on the case; it behooves the Court to remind them to maintain due respect for the Courts and the Court's magistrates and not to manifestly exceed their governmental functions by filing clearly unfounded, baseless and unsubstantiated complaints to harass and disrespect the magistrates of the CA. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)


- We address Villamin and Balce's allegation that the CA Associate Justices committed grave abuse of discretion; the present administrative complaint is not the proper judicial remedy to rectify alleged judicial errors of grave abuse of discretion; the appropriate judicial remedy for instances of grave abuse of discretion is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Court; Martinez v. Judge De Vera, cited. (Id.)

Gross incompetence and gross ignorance of the law 
- The CA Associate Justices of the Special 12th and Special 3rd Divisions did not commit gross incompetence and gross ignorance of the law in issuing the aforementioned resolutions against the DILG and Ombudsman; in resolving the propriety of granting Tallado's prayer for preliminary injunction and TRO, the CA Associate Justices of both the Special 12th and Special 3rd Divisions took into account the applicable law and recent jurisprudence, specifically the Court's ruling in Morales v. Court of Appeals; the CA Associate Justices, hence, acted prudently and within the authority of settled jurisprudence and the Rules of Court; Villamin and Balce also failed to present any evidence of malice, bad faith or fraud on the part of the CA Associate Justices to substantiate their bare allegations; considering that the grave penalty of suspension and dismissal of Tallado as Governor of Camarines Norte would unduly result to the premature disenfranchisement of the constituents of the province who voted for Tallado during the last 9 May 2016 elections, the CA Associate Justices acted with diligence and good faith when they issued the injunctive writs in order to maintain the status quo while Tallado's petition of review was pending before the CA. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)

Impeachment 
- In a Resolution, the Court En Banc dropped Associate Justice Rosmari D. Carandang as one of the respondents in the present administrative case; being a member of the Court, she can only be subjected to disciplinary proceedings through impeachment under Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution; such power to initiate all cases of impeachment is solely lodged with the House of Representatives; in a Resolution dated 7 January 2020, the Court En Banc dropped Associate Justice Mario Lopez as one of the respondents in the present administrative case; Justice Lopez, also a member of the Court is, similarly, subject to impeachment proceedings under the 1987 Constitution and the Court has no jurisdiction over the complaint. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)

#### LABOR ARBITERS

Jurisdiction over money claims and damages 
- Not all controversies or money claims by an employee against the employer or vice versa fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the LA; with regard to money claims and damages, Article 224 (formerly Article 217) of the Labor Code, as amended, bestows upon the LA original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases filed by workers involving wages, among others, if accompanied by a claim for reinstatement; all claims, except those for Employees Compensation, Social Security, Medicare and maternity benefits, arising from employer-employee relations involving an amount exceeding P5,000.00 regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for reinstatement; and claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from employer-employee relations; as can be gleaned above, the jurisdiction of the LA over money claims and damages is confined to those cases which are either accompanied by a claim for reinstatement or arising from employer-employee relations; although employment relations existed between respondent and petitioner, and the subject of the complaint before the LA was petitioner's money claims against respondent, such money claims did not involve and did not arise out of such employment relationship; petitioner's claims have no "reasonable causal connection" with his employment relationship with respondent; it bears to point out that the case that petitioner filed was neither a complaint for illegal dismissal nor a claim for reinstatement; the principal relief sought by petitioner in his complaint was not the payment of his separation package but the release to him of the withheld amount of P1,400,000.00, to which both he and the Cooperative claimed entitlement; in addition, he also sought the return of the alleged excess deductions made for his 2007 loan in the amount of P279,464.00; given that the disputed amount of P1,400,000.00 and the alleged excess deductions of P279,464.00 both relate to petitioner's alleged indebtedness to the Cooperative and not to respondent, it becomes apparent that the controversy involves debtor-creditor relations between petitioner and the Cooperative, rather than employer-employee relations between respondent and petitioner; evidently, the employer-employee relationship between respondent and petitioner in this case is merely incidental and the principal relief sought by petitioner can be resolved not by reference to the Labor Code or other labor relations statute or a collective bargaining agreement but by the general civil law. (Tumaodos vs. San Miguel Yamamura Packaging Corporation, G.R. 241865, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### LABOR RELATIONS

Recruitment 
- Recruitment, under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, is defined as any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, that any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee, employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement. (People vs. Rios y Catagbui, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### LABOR STANDARDS

Payment of 13th month pay 
- With respect to Roxas's claim for 13th month pay, the same is not warranted since Section 3(e) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing P.D. No. 851 expressly exempted from payment of 13th month pay employers of those who are paid on purely commission, boundary, or task basis, and those who are paid a fixed amount for performing a specific work, irrespective of the time consumed in the performance thereof, except where the workers are paid on piece-rate basis in which case the employer shall be covered by this issuance insofar as such workers are concerned. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### LAND REGISTRATION

Lands of the public domain 
- Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution classifies the lands of public domain as follows: (1) agricultural, (2) forest or timber, (3) mineral lands, and (4) national parks; only agricultural lands may be alienated and disposed of by the State. (Republic vs. San Lorenzo Development Corporation (SLDC), G.R. 220902, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### LAND TITLES

Re-survey of the property – In such cases where the evidence insufficiently indicates the identity of the properties in dispute, this Court has deemed it most equitable and just to remand the case to the trial court for a re-survey of the property under the auspices of a geodetic engineer employed by the Land Management Bureau; here, while two surveys were conducted on the disputed lots, no geodetic engineer from the Land Management Bureau of the DENR was involved in any of them; likewise, it has already been shown that the evidence submitted by the parties is conflicting and inconclusive as to the exact identity of the parcels covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 6727 and 6728; considering that this case has dragged on for almost twenty-five (25) years, this Court deems it just and equitable to settle it once and for all through a definitive and authoritative survey of the disputed property undertaken by the agency with the required expertise on the matter. (Dalida vs. Concepcion Bohol-Zenoni, G.R. 214649, Feb. 26, 2020)

LASCIVIOUS CONDUCT UNDER SECTION 5(b) OF R.A. 7610

Penalty and civil liability 
- The imposable penalty for lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, in Criminal Case No. P-4356, is reclusion temporal medium to reclusion perpetua; the Indeterminate Sentence Law provides that if the crime is punished under a special law, as in this case, the maximum term shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same; nonetheless, when the crime is defined in a special law but the penalty therefor is taken from the technical nomenclature in the RPC, the legal effects under the system of penalties native to the Code would necessarily apply to the special law; applying the ISL, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum; accused-appellant is further ordered to pay AAA the amounts of Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php 50,000.00 as moral damages, and Php 50,000.00 as exemplary damages. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### LEASE

Implied contract renewal 
- Based on the terms of the Lease Contract, renewal would be at the option of the lessee; however, after the original Lease Contract had expired, petitioners continued to pay rentals to the lessor; this constitutes an implied lease contract renewal, as the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly found; Dizon v. CA, cited; this Court ruled that implied renewals do not include the option to buy, as it is not germane to the lessee's continued use of the property; moreover, since Overland failed to avail of the option to buy within the stipulated period, it no longer had any right to enforce this option after that period had lapsed; petitioners can only invoke the right to ask for the rescission of the contract if their right to first refusal, as embodied in the original Lease Contract, is included in the implied renewal; based on Article 1643, the lessee's main obligation is to allow the lessee to enjoy the use of the thing leased; without any express contract renewal, this Court cannot presume that both parties agreed to revive all the terms in the previous lease contract. (Mañas, joined by wife Lena Isabelle Y. Mañas vs. Roca, et al., G.R. 208845, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 (R.A. 7160)

Barangay conciliation proceedings 
- The Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court's ruling that petitioners failed to comply with a condition precedent; Section 412 of R.A. 7160 provides: SECTION 412. Conciliation. 
- (a) Pre-condition to Filing of Complaint in Court. 
- No complaint, petition, action, or proceeding involving any matter within the authority of the lupon shall be filed or instituted directly in court or any other government office for adjudication, unless there has been a confrontation between the parties before the lupon chairman or the pangkat, and that no conciliation or settlement has been reached as certified by the lupon secretary or pangkat secretary as attested to by the lupon or pangkat chairman or unless the settlement has been repudiated by the parties thereto; generally, all parties must first undergo barangay conciliation proceedings before filing a complaint in court; none of the exceptions under the law are present in this case. (Mañas, joined by wife Lena Isabelle Y. Mañas vs. Roca, et al., G.R. 208845, Feb. 3, 2020)

Power to assess and collect real estate taxes 
- Under the Real Property Tax Code, the local government unit where the property is located has the authority to assess or appraise the current and fair market value of the property and to collect the taxes due thereon; to determine who has the right to collect taxes from Sps. Braña, it is necessary to determine the location of the property; while the TCTs state that the location is in Pasig, the same cannot be relied in this case because the location of the property is precisely in dispute; the RTC of Antipolo, which has jurisdiction over the boundary dispute case, would be the best forum to determine the precise metes and bounds of the City of Pasig's and the Municipality of Cainta's respective territorial jurisdiction, as well as the extent of each local government unit's authority. (Municipality of Cainta, Rizal vs. Spouses Braña, et al., G.R. 199290, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### LOCAL TAXATION

Payment during boundary dispute 
- Payment of real estate taxes must continue notwithstanding the boundary dispute case; Sps. Braña are ordered to deposit the succeeding payment of real estate taxes due on the subject properties in an account with the Land Bank of the Philippines in escrow for the City of Pasig/the Municipality of Cainta; the proceeds of the same will be released to the local government adjudged by virtue of a final judgment on the issue of territorial jurisdiction over the disputed areas. (Municipality of Cainta, Rizal vs. Spouses Braña, et al., G.R. 199290, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### MIGRANT WORKERS AND OVERSEAS FILIPINOS ACT OF 1995 (R.A. 8042), AS AMENDED BY R.A. 10022

Compulsory life insurance benefit 
- Section 23 of R.A. 10022 provides for the compulsory insurance coverage of migrant workers; respondents become liable for the payment of the compulsory life insurance benefit of USD15,000.00 only when the employee died of an accidental death; inasmuch as the Court had already ruled that Manuel committed suicide, the CA correctly deleted the award of USD15,000.00 by way of life insurance in favor of the petitioner; even assuming that respondents failed to procure a life insurance coverage for Manuel as mandated by R.A. 10022, such failure does not merit the automatic award of the aforementioned sum to the petitioner as the same pertains to the minimum of the life insurance policy coverage to be paid by the insurance company only to qualified beneficiaries and for such causes as specified therein, and is not a penalty or fine to be paid by the manning agency. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

Termination without just, valid or authorized cause 
- Gallego is a seafarer and an overseas worker, whose contract is with a term; he is entitled to security of tenure at least for the period agreed upon in his contract; hence, the provision of Section 10 of R.A. 8042, as amended by R.A. 10022, is applicable; the provision states that termination of overseas employment without just, valid or authorized cause shall entitle the worker to his or her salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract; Gallego had a one-year contract with respondents from December 1999 until December 10, 2000; he was repatriated on August 4, 2000; therefore, he still had an unexpired portion of contract of four months and six days for which he must be paid the value of USD8,182.00 subject to legal interest of twelve percent (12 percent ) per annum from his illegal dismissal on August 4, 2000 to June 30, 2013 and six percent (6 percent ) per annum from July 1, 2013 to the date that this Decision becomes final and executory. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES

Voluntary surrender 
- Voluntary surrender must be considered in the instant case for the reduction of penalty; its requisites, as a mitigating circumstance, are that: (1) the accused has not been actually arrested; (2) the accused surrenders himself to a person in authority or the latter's agent; and (3) the surrender is voluntary. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### MONETARY AWARDS

Legal interest 
- Based on the prevailing jurisprudence, the actual base for the computation of 6 percent  per annum legal interest (the prevailing legal interest prescribed under Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board Circular No. 799, Series of 2013) of the total monetary awards shall be the amount finally adjudged, that is from the finality of this judgment until their full satisfaction. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### MORAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES

Award of 
- Since respondents were able to duly prove, and the petitioner had already received the amount of USD670.03 representing Manuel's uncollected salary, the CA correctly deleted the same; petitioner is also not entitled to moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees; the refusal of the respondents to pay the benefits being claimed by the petitioner, and the delay in the eventual release of the last salary of Manuel, did not arise out of bad faith, but brought about by their firm belief of petitioner's lack of entitlement thereto and the merits of their cause; mere failure of the respondents to furnish the petitioner with a copy of the CBA does not establish bad faith; the terms of the employment contract of Manuel had been faithful to the benefits spelled out in the said CBA. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### MOTION TO DISMISS

Failure to state a cause of action 
- Failure to state a cause of action in an initiatory pleading is a ground for the dismissal of a case; Rule 16, Section 1(g) of the Rules of Court states that: SECTION 1. Grounds. - Within the time for but before filing the answer to the complaint or pleading asserting a claim, a motion to dismiss may be made on any of the following grounds: (g) That the pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action; though obvious from the text of the provision, the non-statement of the cause of action must be apparent from the complaint or other initiatory pleading; for this reason, it has been consistently held that in ruling upon a motion to dismiss grounded upon failure to state a cause of action, courts must only consider the facts alleged in the complaint, without reference to matters outside thereof; an early commentary on the Rules of Court describes a motion to dismiss as "the usual, proper, and ordinary method of testing the legal sufficiency of a complaint." (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### MURDER

Commission of 
- Ernie categorically stated that his father was sleeping inside the nipa hut when accused-appellant stabbed him using a "pinuti"; Olipio was lying on his stomach, with his face down, and it was in that position that he was killed by accused-appellant; under such circumstance, there is no doubt that he was not in a position to put up any form of defense against his assailant. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

Elements 
- Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the essential elements of murder are: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him; (3) the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248; and (4) the killing is neither parricide nor infanticide. (People vs. Pigar y @ "Biroy," G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020) (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)


- With respect to Criminal Case No. AR-4143, the crime of murder is defined under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. 7659; the following elements must be established: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

Penalty 
- The RTC and CA were both correct in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua, together with the accessory penalty provided by law, instead of death considering that the latter penalty has been suspended by R.A. 9346; as to the award of damages, the modifications made by the CA already conform to the latest jurisprudence on the matter; when the crime proven is consummated and the penalty imposed is death but reduced to reclusion perpetua, the civil indemnity and moral damages that should be awarded will each be P100,000.00 and another P100,000.00 for exemplary damages in view of the heinousness of the crime and to set an example; other than treachery which was used to qualify the killing, the special aggravating circumstance of relationship was specifically alleged in the information and the accused-appellant did not deny that he is the victim's brother-in-law, a relative by affinity within the second civil degree. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1997

Income taxation 
- Neither was there any showing that petitioner voluntarily opted to retire so as to treat the amount she received as her retirement pay; not being a retirement pay, it was plain error on the part of the CA to have applied the four conditions under Section 32(B)(6)(a) of the NIRC for tax exemption of retirement benefits; since the amount received by petitioner was separation pay, such is exempt from income tax under Section 32(B)(6)(b) of the NIRC. (Mateo vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc., G.R. 226064, Feb. 17, 2020)

Non-recognition of gain or loss 
- Respondents anchor their claim for refund on the tax-free exchange provision under Section 40(C)(2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; the requisites for the non-recognition of gain or loss are as follows: (a) the transferee is a corporation; (b) the transferee exchanges its shares of stock for property/ies of the transferor; (c) the transfer is made by a person, acting alone or together with others, not exceeding four persons; and (d) as a result of the exchange the transferor, alone or together with others, not exceeding four, gains control of the transferee. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

Transfer of corporation 
- Section 40(C)(6)(c) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, defines the term "control" as "ownership of stocks in a corporation possessing at least fifty-one percent (51 percent ) of the total voting power of all classes of stocks entitled to vote"; as regards the element of control, the Court, in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Filinvest Dev't. Corp., clarified that it is not necessary that, after the exchange, each of the transferors individually gains control of the transferee corporation; it also does not prohibit instances when the transferor gains further control of the transferee corporation; the element of control is satisfied even if one of the transferors is already owning at least 51 percent  of the shares of the transferee corporation, as long as after the exchange, the transferors, not more than five, collectively increase their equity in the transferee corporation by 51 percent  or more; based on Filinvest, the CIR clearly has no basis to claim that the share swap transaction between respondents and Puregold is not covered by the tax-free exchange as provided in Section 40(C)(2) in relation to Section 40(C)(6)(c) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; after the exchange, respondents collectively increased their control over Puregold from 66.57 percent  to 75.83 percent ; respondents cannot be held liable for income taxes on the supposed gain which may have resulted from such transfer; the CGT paid by respondents on the subject transfer are considered erroneously paid taxes and must perforce be refunded. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### 2011 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION RULES OF PROCEDURE

Execution of judgments 
- There is no basis for the proposition that petitioners should be deemed to have abandoned their petition before the CA; there is no showing that the payment made by petitioners to Solacito was by virtue of a settlement and in consideration of the termination of the case; on the contrary, records bear out that such payment was made pursuant to a writ of execution; under the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure, the filing of a petition for certiorari with the CA shall not stay the execution of the assailed decision unless a restraining order is issued by the CA. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)

Submission of position paper and reply 
- Petitioners originally argued that Dela Cruz was not terminated as she was merely suspended and that the latter did not report back to work after having been preventively suspended; petitioners raised abandonment as a defense only in their Reply before the CA; such is not allowed; Section 12, Rule V of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure, as amended, proscribes the parties from alleging and/or proving facts and any cause or causes of action not referred or included in the complaint or raised in the parties' position papers. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC)

Decision of the NLRC 
- Under the Labor Code, the decision of the NLRC shall become final and executory after 10 days from notice if no appeal is taken therefrom within said period; it is settled that the aggrieved party may still seek reconsideration of the decision of the NLRC, and then seasonably avail itself of the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65; here, as shown by the records, petitioners timely filed a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC Decision and a petition for certiorari; thus, the NLRC Decision is not yet immutable. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)

Issuance of writs of injunction 
- Article 225(e) of the Labor Code empowers the NLRC "to enjoin or restrain any actual or threatened commission of any or all prohibited or unlawful acts or to require the performance of a particular act in any labor dispute which, if not restrained or performed forthwith, may cause grave or irreparable damage to any party or render ineffectual any decision in favor of such party"; Article 223 provides that decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the NLRC; the NLRC has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by labor arbiters as provided in Article 217(b) of the Labor Code; from the finding of illegal dismissal up to the execution of the monetary award, the jurisdiction of the NLRC is appellate in nature; "Article 218(e) of the Labor Code does not provide blanket authority to the NLRC or any of its divisions to issue writs of injunction, considering that Section 1 of Rule XI of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC makes injunction only an ancillary remedy in ordinary labor disputes"; moreover, there is no showing of any urgency or irreparable injury which the complainants might suffer; they are already assured of adequate compensation; "an injunction, as an extraordinary remedy, is not favored in labor law considering that it generally has not proved to be an effective means of settling labor disputes; it has been the policy of the State to encourage the parties to use the non-judicial process of negotiation and compromise, mediation and arbitration." (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### NATURALIZATION

Effect 
- Clear from P.D. Nos. 836 and 923 is that the naturalization extends to the alien wife and minor children of the person naturalized upon the wife's showing that she does not suffer from any of the disqualifications under Letter of Instructions No. 270, and that she and her minor children reside permanently in the Philippines at the time of her husband's naturalization; in other words, the only persons to undergo the proceeding before the Special Committee on Naturalization will only be the person naturalized and his wife; the minor children, in the words of Letter of P.D. No. 836 "follow the acquired Filipino citizenship of their mother"; besides, the entries sought to be changed are the nationalities of Lao Kian Ben and Chia Kong Liong as appearing in the certificates of live birth of Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas; therefore, the only relevant issue, at least for the present proceedings, is whether or not Lao Kian Ben and Chia Kong Liong have been issued their Certificates of Naturalization and have taken their Oaths of Allegiance as Filipinos, an issue that has been resolved in the affirmative. (Republic, Represented by the Special Committee on Naturalization (SCN) vs. Chia Lao, et al., G.R. 205218, Feb. 10, 2020)

Types of 
- Naturalization may be either administrative, judicial, or legislative; as the name implies, administrative naturalization is the grant of Filipino citizenship to aliens via administrative proceedings and is currently governed by R.A. 9139; judicial naturalization grants Filipino citizenship through a judicial decree and is governed by Commonwealth Act No. 423 or the Revised Naturalization Law, as amended; lastly, legislative naturalization bestows Filipino citizenship through a statute enacted by Congress; it is undisputed that Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas' father, Lao Kian Ben, applied for naturalization under Letter of Instructions No. 270, and his application was granted under P.D. No. 923; P.D. No. 923 provided for the same rights, privileges, duties, and obligations as well as conditions and effects of naturalization as those provided in P.D. No. 836. (Republic, Represented by the Special Committee on Naturalization (SCN) vs. Chia Lao, et al., G.R. 205218, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### NEW CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT FOR THE PHILIPPINE JUDICIARY

Canon 2 
- The Court finds Judge Santos guilty of violating Sections 1 and 2, Canon 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary which provide: CANON 2. INTEGRITY. Integrity is essential not only to the proper discharge of the judicial office but also to the personal demeanor of judges; SECTION 1. Judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer; SEC. 2. The behavior and conduct of judges must reaffirm the people's faith in the integrity of the judiciary; justice must not merely be done but must also be seen to be done; the Court has previously ruled: "It is obvious, therefore, that while judges should possess proficiency in law in order that they can competently construe and enforce the law, it is more important that they should act and behave in such a manner that the parties before them should have confidence in their impartiality"; while the courts are enjoined to make the parties agree on an equitable compromise, the judges' efforts to make the parties agree should be within the bounds of propriety and without the slightest perception of impartiality; from the very beginning, Judge Santos has shown his predisposition to resolve the case by way of an amicable settlement when he directed the parties to propose specific terms and conditions for possible amicable settlement, and constantly cajoled them to do so through his Orders; he did not deny that in his effort to persuade the parties, he committed the said acts. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

#### OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL (OSG)

Powers and functions 
- As to the authority of the Solicitor General to file the complaint for expropriation, we hold that, at the time of the institution of this case in 1980, Section 1(a) of P.D. No. 478, otherwise known as "Defining the Powers and Functions of the Office of the Solicitor General" provides that the Solicitor General has the power to represent the government and its officers before this Court and the CA, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party; moreover, Section 1(k) of P.D. No. 478 likewise provides that the Solicitor General can act and represent the RP and/or the people before any court, tribunal, body or commission in any matter, action or proceedings which, in his opinion, affects the welfare of the people as the ends of justice may require; with the foregoing in mind, we rule that the Solicitor General has the authority to initiate the present expropriation case against the respondents; contrary to the respondents' arguments, the Solicitor General's authority to file the instant complaint for expropriation on September 5, 1980 emanates from the authority provided under P.D. No. 478. (Republic vs. Castillo, et al., G.R. 190453, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### PARTIES TO CIVIL ACTIONS

Indispensable parties 
- An indispensable party is one whose interest will be affected by the court's action in the litigation, and without whom no final determination of the case can be had; the party's interest in the subject matter of the suit and in the relief sought are so inextricably intertwined with the other parties' that his legal presence as a party to the proceeding is an absolute necessity; in his or her absence, there cannot be a resolution of the dispute of the parties before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable; thus, the absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void, for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present; in an action for partition, all the co-heirs and persons having an interest in the property are indispensable parties; as such, an action for partition will not lie without the joinder of the said parties. (Agcaoili vs. Mata, G.R. 224414, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Indispensable parties are parties whose legal presence in the proceeding is so necessary that "the action cannot be finally determined" without them because their interests in the matter and in the relief "are so bound up with that of the other parties"; Valeriano and his heirs were not indispensable parties as they no longer stood to be directly benefited or injured by the judgment in the petition for reallocation filed by respondent; Valeriano and his heirs ceased to have an interest in the subject lot after the issuance of the final judgment disqualifying Valeriano as a farmer beneficiary thereof; contrary to petitioners' contention, the failure to implead Valeriano or his heirs (i.e., herein petitioners) did not deprive the DAR-Region VIII, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator, and the DARAB Central Office of jurisdiction over the cases filed before them. (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Indispensable parties or parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action, shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants; there are two consequences of a finding on appeal that indispensable parties have not been joined: first, all subsequent actions of the lower courts are null and void for lack of jurisdiction; second, the case should be remanded to the trial court for the inclusion of indispensable parties; it is only upon the plaintiff's refusal to comply with an order to join indispensable parties that the case may be dismissed; all subsequent actions of lower courts are void as to both the absent and present parties; the inclusion of an indispensable party is a jurisdictional requirement; both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals found that Diator, the seller in the Deeds of Absolute Sale, and Mahid's estate are indispensable parties, without whom no final determination can be had of the action for annulment filed by petitioners; since this case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the trial court, the second case is not an option. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

Real party in interest 
- An action for the annulment of contracts may be instituted by all who are obliged to it principally or subsidiarily; by the principle of relativity or privity of contracts, contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns, and heirs; while the principle acknowledges that contractual obligations are transmissible to a party's assigns and heirs, petitioners here do not claim to be heirs of any party to the Deeds of Absolute Sale; it is actually respondent who was party to the sale, not Mahid; therefore, petitioners, not being privy to the Deeds of Absolute Sale, are not the real parties in interest to question their validity. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Generally, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest, the one "who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit"; to be a real party in interest, one "should appear to be the present real owner of the right sought to be enforced, that is, his or her interest must be a present substantial interest, not a mere expectancy, or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest"; rationale for such requirement, explained in Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc. v. Cuenca: The purposes of the requirement for the real party in interest prosecuting or defending an action at law are: (a) to prevent the prosecution of actions by persons without any right, title or interest in the case; (b) to require that the actual party entitled to legal relief be the one to prosecute the action; (c) to avoid a multiplicity of suits; and (d) to discourage litigation and keep it within certain bounds, pursuant to sound public policy; considering that all civil actions must be based on a cause of action, the former as the defendant must be allowed to insist upon being opposed by the real party in interest so that he is protected from further suits regarding the same claim; the requirement benefits the defendant because "the defendant can insist upon a plaintiff who will afford him a setup providing good res judicata protection if the struggle is carried through on the merits to the end"; the rule on real party in interest ensures, therefore, that the party with the legal right to sue brings the action, and this interest ends when a judgment involving the nominal plaintiff will protect the defendant from a subsequent identical action. (Id.)


- Petitioners here are not vested with direct and substantial interest in the subject parcels of land; they are not the present real owners of the right sought to be enforced; they claim their interests only as heirs of Mahid, who was not proven to have any right or interest in the parcels of land titled in respondent's name; not being real parties in interest, petitioners cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court; persons having no material interest to protect cannot invoke its jurisdiction as the plaintiff in an action; "nor does a court acquire jurisdiction over a case where the real party in interest is not present or impleaded." (Id.)

#### PETITION FOR RELIEF

Time for filing 
- Another ground relied upon by the CA in dismissing the petition for certiorari is petitioner's failure to explain as to why he did not avail himself of the remedy of an appeal; however, in this particular case wherein the extrinsic fraud alleged by petitioner allegedly resulted in the lack of valid service of summons upon him and consequently, the RTC's lack of jurisdiction over his person, the Court rules that the issues on the availability of an appeal and the propriety of availing oneself of the remedy of petition for relief may only be resolved by looking into the merits of petitioner's arguments; a petition for relief is governed by Section 1, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; it provides: SEC. 1. Petition for relief from judgment, order, or other proceedings. 
- When a judgment or final order is entered, or any other proceeding is thereafter taken against a party in any court through fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, he may file a petition in such court and in the same case praying that the judgment, order or proceeding be set aside; also, the time for filing a petition for relief is provided under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; the double period provided under Section 3, Rule 38, i.e., (1) 60 days after petitioner learns of the judgment, final order, or other proceeding to be set aside; and (2) not more than six months after such judgment or final order was entered, or such proceeding was taken, is jurisdictional and must be strictly complied with; thus, a petition for relief from judgment filed beyond the reglementary period is dismissed outright; thus, for the filing of a petition for relief to be proper, petitioner must satisfy the following requirements: (1) he or she has no adequate remedy available to him, which is either a motion for new trial or appeal from adverse decisions of the lower court, and he was prevented by fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence from filing such motion or taking the appeal; and (2) he or she must comply with the double period set forth under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; however, these rules are not to be taken as absolute; in fact, the Court deems it proper to make an exception in this case; specifically, the above-stated rule will not apply when a petition for relief which is grounded on extrinsic fraud ultimately results in the court's lack of jurisdiction over the defendant, and which consequently makes the judgment rendered by the trial court void. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Petitioner invoked the ground of extrinsic fraud in his petition for relief; he argued that he was deprived of the opportunity to participate in the proceedings before the RTC in Civil Case No. Q-09-65496 by reason of respondents' act of providing the court with an erroneous address where summons may be served on him; the rule is that jurisdiction over a defendant in a civil case is acquired either through service of summons or through voluntary appearance in court and submission to its authority; thus, in the absence of service or when the service of summons upon the person of defendant is defective, the court acquires no jurisdiction over his person, and the judgment rendered against him is null and void; lack of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court in rendering the judgment or final order is either lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action, or lack of jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner; the former is a matter of substantive law because statutory law defines the jurisdiction of the courts over the subject matter or nature of the action; the latter is a matter of procedural law, for it involves the service of summons or other processes on the petitioner; a petition for relief which is grounded on extrinsic fraud and which ultimately negates the court's jurisdiction may be filed anytime as long as the action is not barred by laches or estoppel; since Rule 45 of the Rules of Court clearly provides that only questions of law shall be entertained in a petition for review on certiorari, the Court deems it proper to remand the case to the CA for determination of the merits of petitioner's petition for certiorari. (Id.)

#### PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION – STANDARD EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT (POEA-SEC)

Assessment of fitness to work of degree of disability 
- After undergoing a pre-employment medical examination (PEME), petitioner was declared fit to work and was permitted to board MV British Ruby on July 22, 2015; although a PEME is not expected to be an in-depth examination of a seafarer's health, still, it must fulfill its purpose of ascertaining a prospective seafarer's capacity for safely performing tasks at sea; thus, if it concludes that a seafarer, even one with an existing medical condition, is "fit for sea duty," it must, on its face, be taken to mean that the seafarer is well in a position to engage in employment aboard a sea vessel without danger to his health. (Lemoncito vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Philippines, Inc./Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (Isle of Man Ltd.), G.R. 247409, Feb. 3, 2020)


- At the time Solacito filed the complaint, he had no basis to oppose the findings of the company-designated physicians; on this score, the complaint should have already been dismissed at the level of the LA for lack of cause of action; even if the Court gives due course to the complaint despite it having been filed prematurely, Solacito failed to rebut the findings of the company-designated physicians; Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC requires that, after medical repatriation, the company-designated physician must assess the seafarer's fitness to work or the degree of his disability; thereafter, the seafarer may choose his own doctor to dispute the findings of the company-designated physician; if the findings of the company-designated physician and the seafarer's doctor of choice are conflicting, the matter is then referred to a third doctor, whose findings shall be binding on both parties; it was incumbent on Solacito to refer the findings of his own doctor to his employer who would then have had the obligation to commence the process of the selection of the third doctor; jurisprudence is likewise settled that non-referral to a third doctor, whose decision shall be considered as final and binding, constitutes a breach of the POEA-SEC and the assessment of the company-designated physician shall prevail; hence, on the basis of the medical assessment issued by the company-designated physicians, Solacito should be considered able and fit to work, and therefore not entitled to any disability benefit 
- not even a partial disability benefit. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In their final Medical Report, the company-designated doctors stated: On its face, there was no categorical statement that petitioner is fit or unfit to resume his work as a seaman; it simply stated: a) petitioner was previously cleared of his lower respiratory tract infection; b) petitioner's blood pressure is adequately controlled with medications; and c) petitioner was cleared cardiac wise as of July 1, 2016; this assessment is incomplete, nay, inconclusive; Ampo-on v. Reinier Pacific International Shipping, Inc. explains: Upon finding that the seafarer suffers a work-related injury or illness, the employer is obligated to refer the former to a company-designated physician, who has the responsibility to arrive at a definite assessment of the former's fitness or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation; this period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, if the seafarer requires further medical treatment, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this extended period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists; a final and definite disability assessment is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries of the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such; failure of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the prescribed periods and if the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the law steps in to consider the latter's disability as total and permanent. (Lemoncito vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Philippines, Inc./Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (Isle of Man Ltd.), G.R. 247409, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The 2010 POEA-SEC imposes upon the company-designated physician the responsibility to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation; during the said period, the seafarer shall be deemed on temporary total disability and shall receive his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA-SEC and by applicable Philippine laws; however, if the 120-day period is exceeded and no definitive declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists; failure of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the prescribed periods, and if the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the law steps in to consider the latter's disability as total and permanent. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The assessment of the company-designated physicians is already binding on Solacito given his premature filing of the complaint and his failure to observe the procedure under Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC; there is, therefore, no basis to ascribe a disability rating to Solacito; as explained in Caredo v. Maine Marine Philippines, Inc., the determination of the fitness of a seafarer for sea duty is the province of the company-designated physician; it is therefore beyond the courts' authority, nay expertise, to prescribe a disability rating to Solacito in contravention of the valid and binding findings of the company-designated physicians; the records also bear that the company-designated physicians issued said final and definitive medical assessment within 240 days; particularly, the Medical Report was issued after 188 days from his medical repatriation; even the subsequent medical report dated February 10, 2010 of the company-designated physicians was issued within the 240-day window; following the "120/240-day rule" on claims for permanent and total disability benefits, Solacito had no basis to insist that he is suffering from total or partial permanent disability. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The company-designated physician only issued an interim assessment; the letter did not indicate whether the illness of Rosales was resolved; instead, he was recommended to undergo treatment for approximately six (6) months, depending on his response to the treatment; in Sunit v. OSM Maritime Services, Inc., the Court emphasized: A final and definite disability assessment is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries of the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such; otherwise, the corresponding disability benefits awarded might not be commensurate with the prolonged effects of the injuries suffered; the inconclusive assessment and Rosales' prolonged illness highlighted that the company-designated physician failed to render a definitive assessment of his disability; thus, there is no need to comply with the third-doctor referral provision under the POEA-SEC; Rosales is considered permanently and totally disabled; Rosales should also be paid his sickness allowance during the period of his treatment with the company-designated physician pursuant to Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC; considering that the company-designated physician failed to make a final diagnosis of Rosales' illness, he is entitled to the maximum allowable sickness allowance equivalent to 120 days; the financial assistance awarded by the CA in the amount of USD5,000.00 is sustained due to respondents' failure to contest the same, even at the Labor Arbiter level. (Rosales vs. Singa Ship Management Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 234914, Feb. 19, 2020)


- There was no medical abandonment on the part of petitioner given that the company-designated physician, in the confidential medical report dated November 3, 2015, had already declared the former to have "already reached his maximum medical improvement," thus, indicating his treatment through curative means to have already ended and that the subsequent check-ups were for the improvement of his physical appearance by means of fitting a scleral shell prosthesis; the said medical report also recommended a Grade 7 disability rating based on the specialist's finding that petitioner's visual prognosis and recovery were poor due to "permanent loss of vision in one eye despite intravenous antibiotic and steroids as well as oral medications given," thus rendering him "unfit for further sea duties"; considering that: (1) in the November 3, 2015 medical report, which was issued within the 120-day treatment period, the company-designated physician already gave petitioner a partial and permanent disability rating of Grade 7, i.e., loss of vision or total blindness in one eye, and declared him to have already reached his maximum medical improvement, rendering him unfit for further sea duties; and (2) during petitioner's subsequent check-ups, the company-designated physician did not find any significant improvement in his condition. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Under Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, the employer shall be liable for disability benefits only when the seafarer suffers from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract; a work-related illness is defined as "any sickness as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this Contract with the conditions set therein satisfied"; while petitioner's diagnosed condition is not among the listed occupational diseases under Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC, Section 20(A)(4) nonetheless states that "those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work-related"; thus, the burden is on the employer to disprove the work-relatedness, failing which, the disputable presumption that a particular injury or illness that results in disability is work-related stands; unfortunately, the said presumption was not overturned by TSPI; the Grade 7 disability rating assessment by the company-designated physician negates any claim that the non-listed illness is not work-related. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)

Claim for compensation and benefits 
- In this case, Section 20-B of the 2000 POEA-SEC, the governing POEA-SEC at the time Erispe was employed in 2007 although extended multiple times until his disembarkation on January 24, 2010, is applicable; in situations where the seafarer seeks to claim the compensation and benefits that Section 20-B grants to him, the law requires the seafarer to prove that: "(1) he suffered an illness; (2) he suffered this illness during the term of his employment contract; (3) he complied with the procedures prescribed under Section 20-B; (4) his illness is one of the enumerated occupational disease or that his illness or injury is otherwise work-related; and (5) he complied with the four conditions enumerated under Section 32-A for an occupational disease or a disputably-presumed work-related disease to be compensable." (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Compensation and benefits for injury or illness 
- Respondent employer Hanseatic was not remiss in its duty to provide its injured seafarer with sickness allowance; the company had consistently disbursed to Antolino the appropriate amounts on a monthly basis, in keeping with its duty under Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC, viz.: 3. In addition to the above obligation of the employer to provide medical attention, the seafarer shall also receive sickness allowance from his employer in an amount equivalent to his basic wage computed from the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the degree of disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician; the period within which the seafarer shall be entitled to his sickness allowance shall not exceed 120 days; payment of the sickness allowance shall be made on a regular basis, but not less than once a month. (Antolino vs. Hanseatic Shipping Phils. Inc., et al., G.R. 245917, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC provides: Section 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS A. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS. For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance; in the course of the treatment, the seafarer shall also report regularly to the company-designated physician specifically on the dates as prescribed by the company-designated physician and agreed to by the seafarer; failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits; petitioner employee was well-aware that he had a medical examination in Manila scheduled on November 4, 2015; not only would he have been informed of the true status of his injury, but more importantly, the company-designated physician would have been able to assess his condition and declare him fit to work. (Id.)

Condition sine qua non for deployment 
- It is basic that the employment of seafarers and its incidents are governed by the contracts they sign every time they are hired or rehired; these contracts have the force of law between the parties as long as their stipulations are not contrary to law, morals, public order or public policy; every seaman and the vessel owner (directly or represented by a local manning agency) are required to execute the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) as a condition sine qua non to the seafarer's deployment for overseas work; while the relationship between seafarers and their employers are governed by their mutual agreements, "the POEA rules and regulations require that the POEA-SEC, which contains the standard terms and conditions of the seafarers' employment in foreign ocean-going vessels, be integrated in every seafarer's contract." (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Disability compensation 
- There are three (3) instances when a seafarer may be entitled to 100 percent  disability compensation, namely: (1) when the seafarer is declared to have suffered 100 percent  disability; (2) when the seafarer is assessed with disability of at least 50 percent ; and (3) when the seafarer is assessed at below 50 percent  disability, but he or she is certified as permanently unfit for sea service; since petitioner was assessed a Grade 7 disability rating by the company-designated physician, which under the CBA Degree of Disability Rate for Ratings to which he belongs is equivalent to 37.244 or below the 50 percent  disability, and further declared to be unfit for further sea duties as found by the PVA and reflected in the confidential medical report dated November 3, 2015, the CA erred in awarding partial and permanent disability only; petitioner is entitled to 100 percent  disability compensation or in the total amount of USD89,100.00 as provided under the CBA; considering that petitioner was clearly compelled to litigate to enforce what was rightfully due him under the CBA, the award of ten percent (10 percent ) attorney's fees by the PVA was proper, and as such, must be reinstated; in line with prevailing jurisprudence, all monetary awards due petitioner shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6 percent ) per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)

Duties of the company-designated physician 
- Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr. spells out the duties of the company-designated physician when a seafarer is medically repatriated, viz.: 1. The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him; 2. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total; 3. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days; the employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and 4. If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification. (Antolino vs. Hanseatic Shipping Phils. Inc., et al., G.R. 245917, Feb. 26, 2020)

Overtime pay 
- The correct criterion in determining whether or not sailors are entitled to overtime pay is not whether they were on board and cannot leave ship beyond the regular eight working hours a day, but whether they actually rendered service in excess of said number of hours; the rendition of overtime work and the submission of sufficient proof that said work was actually performed are conditions to be satisfied before a seafarer could be entitled to overtime pay; no proof was presented by Erispe that he actually performed overtime work while onboard; thus, there was no basis for the award thereof; also, in the case of an illegally dismissed overseas worker, entitlement to fixed overtime pay equivalent to the unexpired portion of the latter's contract must first be established, otherwise the same cannot be allowed. (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Permanent total disability compensation 
- Since petitioner was declared by no less than his attending specialist to be unfit for further sea service due to permanent loss of vision in his left eye, the Court finds his resulting disability to be not only partial and permanent as ruled by the CA, but rather total and permanent as correctly found by the PVA; in disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity; total disability refers to an employee's inability to perform his or her usual work; it does not require total paralysis or complete helplessness; permanent disability, on the other hand, is a worker's inability to perform his job for more than 120 days or 240 days, if the seafarer required further medical attention justifying the extension of the temporary total disability period, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any part of his body. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Without a valid final and definitive assessment from the company-designated doctors within the 120/240-day period, as in this case, the law already steps in to consider a seafarer's disability as total and permanent; by operation of law, petitioner is already totally and permanently disabled; besides, jurisprudence grants permanent total disability compensation to seafarers, who suffered from either cardiovascular diseases or hypertension, and were under the treatment of or even issued fit-to-work certifications by company-designated doctors beyond 120 or 240 days from their repatriation. (Lemoncito vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Philippines, Inc./Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (Isle of Man Ltd.), G.R. 247409, Feb. 3, 2020)

Termination of seafarer's contract 
- Under Section 23 of the POEA-SEC, an employer may terminate a seafarer's contract due to sale of ship, lay-up or discontinuance of voyage; for such termination to be valid, the same provision states that the seafarer shall immediately be paid his earned wages, repatriation costs and one-month basic pay as termination pay, unless arrangements have been made for the seafarer to join another ship belonging to the same principal to complete his contract, and in the latter case, the seafarer shall be entitled to his basic wages until the date of joining the other ship; applying the foregoing provision and labor principles, respondents have the burden of proving the observance of due process and compliance to Section 23 of the POEA-SEC to consider the dismissal of Gallego valid. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)

Work-related illness 
- Viral Hepatitis is listed as an occupational disease under the POEA-SEC that is work-related and compensable when contracted during the term of the employee's contract; it was established through the letter of the company-designated physician that the illness of Rosales, chronic Hepatitis C, "is acquired by exposure to infected blood through needle or instruments, blood transfusion, vertical transmission from mother to unborn child, sexual intercourse"; while the viral Hepatitis considered occupational disease in the POEA-SEC is limited to those "spread through ingestion of water, milk, or other foods contaminated with hepatitis virus," Section 20(A)(4) of the POEA-SEC provides that even those illnesses not listed in Section 32 are still disputably presumed work-related; despite not being a listed illness in Section 32, Chronic Hepatitis C is disputably presumed to be work-related; the conditions for compensability in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC also apply to non-listed illnesses given that: (1) the legal presumption under Section 20(B)(4) accorded to the latter is limited only to "work-relatedness;" and (2) for its compensability, a reasonable connection between the nature of work on board the vessel and the illness contracted or aggravated must be shown; while Chronic Hepatitis C is not a listed occupational disease, the same standards laid down in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC should be applied in determining the compensability of Rosales' illness; considering the nature of his work – where he had to clean rooms, handle, segregate, and dispose waste materials including syringes and other bio-medical wastes – and the timeline leading to the diagnosis of illness, it can be safely concluded that he contracted Chronic Hepatitis C while on board Queen Mary 2; thus, the company-designated physician's declaration that Rosales' Hepatitis C infection is not work-related is erroneous; with regard to his fatty liver, the illness is work-related too; fatty liver (Steatosis) is common in people afflicted with Hepatitis C as a consequence of viral infection; considering that his fatty liver is attributed to his Chronic Hepatitis C illness, it is also work-related. (Rosales vs. Singa Ship Management Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 234914, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### PLEA BARGAINING

DOJ Circular No. 27 and A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC 
- A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC is a rule of procedure established pursuant to the rule-making power of the Supreme Court that serves as a framework and guide to the trial courts in plea bargaining violations of R.A. 9165; a plea bargain still requires mutual agreement of the parties and remains subject to the approval of the court; the acceptance of an offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the trial court; Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court expressly states: Sec. 2. Plea of guilty to a lesser offense. – At arraignment, the accused, with the consent of the offended party and the prosecutor, may be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense which is necessarily included in the offense charged; after arraignment but before trial, the accused may still be allowed to plead guilty to said lesser offense after withdrawing his pleas of not guilty; no amendment of the complaint or information is necessary; the use of the word "may" signifies that the trial court has discretion whether to allow the accused to make a plea of guilty to a lesser offense; it is also essential that the lesser offense is necessarily included in the offense charged; taking into consideration the requirements in pleading guilty to a lesser offense, We find it proper to treat the refusal of the prosecution to adopt the acceptable plea bargain for the charge of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs provided in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC as a continuing objection that should be resolved by the RTC; this harmonizes the constitutional provision on the rule making power of the Court under the Constitution and the nature of plea bargaining in Dangerous Drugs cases; DOJ Circular No. 27 did not repeal, alter, or modify the Plea Bargaining Framework in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC; the Circular merely serves as an internal guideline for prosecutors to observe before they may give their consent to proposed plea bargains. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)

Nature 
- Plea bargaining was required during pre-trial conference in all criminal cases cognizable by the Municipal Trial Court, the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, the Metropolitan Trial Court, the RTC, and the Sandiganbayan with the objective of promoting fair and expeditious trial; plea bargaining is a vital component of restorative justice; in giving preference to working out a mutually satisfactory resolution of the case sanctioned by the court over lengthy and protracted trial, both the state and the accused benefit; the plea bargaining mechanism affords speedy disposal and cost efficiency which significantly contribute to the restorative justice process; by shortening the time between the original charge and the disposition, it enhances the rehabilitative prospects and redeeming characteristics of the offender when the trial court approves the plea bargain to a lesser offense; the aim is to rehabilitate, not punish, drug offenders; while it is the government's mandate to "pursue an intensive and unrelenting campaign against the trafficking and use of dangerous drugs and other similar substances," it is equally important to highlight "the policy of the State to provide effective mechanisms or measures to re-integrate into society individuals who have fallen victims to drug abuse or dangerous drug dependence"; there are sufficient justifications to deviate from the strict application of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)

#### PLEADINGS

Relief 
- The records do not show that respondents prayed for the conduct of a reinvestigation in their motion for reconsideration; jurisprudence dictates that the courts cannot grant a relief not prayed for in the pleadings or in excess of what is being sought by a party to a case; rationale for this rule, explained in Bucal v. Bucal, citing Development Bank of the Philippines v. Teston; the fundamental purpose of the requirement that allegations of a complaint must provide the measure of recovery is to prevent surprise to the defendant; this protection against surprises granted to defendants should also be available to petitioners; both parties to a suit are entitled to due process against unforeseen and arbitrary judgments; the very essence of due process is "the sporting idea of fair play" which forbids the grant of relief on matters where a party to the suit was not given an opportunity to be heard; the trial court gravely abused its discretion when it issued the assailed September Order. (Social Security System vs. Seno, Jr., et al., G.R. 183478, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### POSSESSION

Actual and constructive possession 
- Possession, under the law, includes not only actual possession, but also constructive possession; actual possession exists when the drug is in the immediate physical possession or control of the accused; constructive possession, on the other hand, exists when the drug is under the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found; exclusive possession or control is not necessary; the accused cannot avoid conviction if his right to exercise control and dominion over the place where the contraband is located, is shared with another; in possession of illicit drugs cases, ownership is inconsequential; mere possession of the illicit drugs is malum prohibitum and the burden of proof is upon the accused to prove that they have a permit or clearance to possess the prohibited drugs. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Concept 
- Preliminary injunctions are issued to preserve the status quo, "the last actual, peaceful, and uncontested status that precedes the actual controversy, that which is existing at the time of the filing of the case"; here, the injunctive relief was sought to bar the implementation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolutions, which would have significantly affected the exercise of power of the municipalities in conflict; contrary to petitioner's actuations, there need not be a determination of whether the March 26, 1962 Decision had attained finality; the trial court did not pass upon its finality when it determined that the writ of preliminary injunction should be issued; respondent satisfactorily showed that its circumstances merited the temporary injunctive relief, lest the reliefs it prayed for in its main Petition be rendered moot when the case has been heard on the merits. (Municipality of Famy, Laguna vs. Municipality of Siniloan, Laguna, G.R. 203806, Feb. 10, 2020)

Writ of 
- Courts are given wide discretion in granting a writ of preliminary injunction; however, this discretion is with limit and must be exercised with great caution; in the absence of grave abuse of discretion, this Court shall not intervene in their exercise of discretion in injunctive matters; in Ong Lay Hin v. Court of Appeals, this Court defined grave abuse of discretion as: the "arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or a capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or a refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law." (Municipality of Famy, Laguna vs. Municipality of Siniloan, Laguna, G.R. 203806, Feb. 10, 2020)


- In Spouses Nisce v. Equitable PCI Bank, this Court explained that litigants applying for injunctive relief must exhibit their "present and unmistakable right to be protected; that the facts against which injunction is directed violate such right; and there is a special and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages"; here, as an incident to its Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition, respondent prayed for injunctive relief to curtail the implementation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolutions, which had declared Barangays Kapatalan and Liyang to be under petitioner's jurisdiction; a perusal of the records reveals that respondent sufficiently alleged and substantiated its clear legal right sought to be protected through the writ of preliminary injunction; respondent, who had in its favor a March 26, 1962 Decision declaring its jurisdiction over the barangays, stood to suffer irreparable injury through the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolutions. (Id.)


- Injunction should not be issued "if there is no clear legal right materially and substantially breached from a prima facie evaluation of the evidence of the complainant"; parties seeking injunction must present evidence to demonstrate their justification for the relief pending final judgment; the evidence need not be complete and conclusive proof; prima facie evidence suffices: It is crystal clear that at the hearing for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, mere prima facie evidence is needed to establish the applicant's rights or interests in the subject matter of the main action; an applicant for a writ is required only to show that he has an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in his complaint. (Id.)


- Rule 58, Section 1 of the Rules of Court defines preliminary injunction; otherwise stated, a writ of preliminary injunction is: an ancillary and interlocutory order issued as a result of an impartial determination of the context of both parties; it entails a procedure for the judge to assess whether the reliefs prayed for by the complainant will be rendered moot simply as a result of the parties' having to go through the full requirements of a case being fully heard on its merits; preliminary injunction may either be prohibitory, when it bars an act, or mandatory, when it requires the performance of a particular act; as an interlocutory order, it is a provisional remedy, temporary in nature; it is ancillary, an incident adjunct to a main action; preliminary injunction is "subject to the final disposition of the principal action"; the trial court's order issuing the injunction is neither a judgment on the merits nor a final disposition of the case. (Id.)


- Rule 58, Section 3 of the Rules of Court enumerates the grounds when a writ of preliminary injunction is proper: Jurisprudence provides that the following must be proven for a writ of preliminary injunction to be issued: (1) The applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right to be protected, that is a right in esse; (2) There is a material and substantial invasion of such right; (3) There is an urgent need for the writ to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and (4) No other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury. (Id.)

#### PRESUMPTIONS

Non-compliance with the chain of custody rule 
- The prosecution's failure to justify its non-compliance with the requirements found in Section 21, specifically, the presence of the three required witnesses during the actual inventory of the seized items, is fatal to their case; it is mandated by no less than the Constitution that an accused in a criminal case shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; in People v. Hilario, the Court ruled that: the prosecution bears the burden to overcome such presumption; if the prosecution fails to discharge this burden, the accused deserves a judgment of acquittal; on the other hand, if the existence of proof beyond reasonable doubt is established by the prosecution, the accused gets a guilty verdict; in order to merit conviction, the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of evidence presented by the defense; absent faithful compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165, which is primarily intended to, first, preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items in drugs cases, and second, to safeguard accused persons from unfounded and unjust convictions, an acquittal becomes the proper recourse. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

Presumption of regular performance by police officers of their official duties 
- The prosecution cannot simply invoke the saving clause found in Section 21 
- that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved 
- without justifying their failure to comply with the requirements stated therein; even the presumption as to the regularity in the performance by police officers of their official duties cannot prevail when there has been a clear and deliberate disregard of procedural safeguards by the police officers themselves; People v. Umipang is instructive on the matter: Minor deviation from the procedure under R.A. 9165 would not automatically exonerate an accused from the crimes of which he or she was convicted; this is especially true when the lapses in procedure were "recognized and explained in terms of justifiable grounds"; there must also be a showing "that the police officers intended to comply with the procedure but were thwarted by some justifiable consideration/reason"; however, when there is gross disregard of the procedural safeguards prescribed in the substantive law (R.A. 9165), serious uncertainty is generated about the identity of the seized items that the prosecution presented in evidence; this uncertainty cannot be remedied by simply invoking the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, for a gross, systematic, or deliberate disregard of the procedural safeguards effectively produces an irregularity in the performance of official duties. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

Presumption of regularity and authenticity of notarized deeds 
- Respondent's titles were derived from the notarized Deeds of Absolute Sale between her and the seller, which are presumed valid, regular, and authentic; notarized deeds of absolute sale such as these enjoy a presumption of regularity and authenticity absent "strong, complete, and conclusive proof of its falsity"; since they assail the genuineness of the Deeds, petitioners must prove their allegation of falsity with clear, strong, and conclusive evidence; here, both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals did not give merit to petitioners' allegation of falsity of the Deeds of Absolute Sale; the documentary evidence submitted by petitioners 
- an Acknowledgment Receipt issued by the seller to Mahid indicating P2 million as partial payment for the properties, the loan obtained by Mahid from one Engr. Cosain Dalidig, and various official receipts of a store in Wao 
- are purely immaterial and do not show any link to the two (2) Deeds of Absolute Sale between respondent and the seller. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS

Requirements 
- It is an elementary rule that when a party files any pleading or motion, a copy thereof must be served on the adverse party; for the essence of procedural due process is embodied in the basic requirement of notice and a real opportunity to be heard; an adverse party must be given an opportunity to be heard through his/her comment, before the case can be presented for adjudication. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### PROCEDURAL RULES

Interpretation 
- In a plethora of cases, the Court relaxed the application of procedural rules; a strict application of the rules should not amount to straight-jacketing the administration of justice and that the principles of justice and equity must not be sacrificed for a stern application of the rules of procedure; thus, when the strict and rigid application of procedural rules would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, they must always be eschewed; in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, the Court finds it proper to resolve the case on the merits. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)


- It is settled that "procedural rules are designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases; courts and litigants alike are enjoined to abide strictly by the rules"; however, it is not novel for courts to brush aside technicalities in the interest of substantial justice; in Malixi v. Baltazar, the Court recounted the long line of jurisprudence consistently supporting the relaxation of procedural rules if strict adherence thereto would only frustrate rather than promote justice; while the Court has entertained petitions in the past despite the presence of procedural lapses, the Court has restricted its liberality only to exceptional circumstances; to warrant relaxation of the rules, the erring party must: (a) show reasonable cause justifying its noncompliance with the rules, (b) convince the Court that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of substantive justice, and (c) offer proof of at least a reasonable attempt at compliance therewith; "the desired leniency cannot be accorded absent valid and compelling reasons for such a procedural lapse." (Kabalikat Para sa Maunlad na Buhay, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. Nos. 217530-31, Feb. 10, 2020) 


- Procedural rules should not be belittled or dismissed because they are tools designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases; court procedure should be strictly followed; they may be relaxed for the most persuasive of reasons, especially, to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the prescribed procedure; no reason to dismiss Gallego's petition because he has sufficiently complied with the requirements under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; We took note and accepted Gallego's compliance of the lacking contents in his petition; respondents' position on procedural lapses will not prosper. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court has ruled against the dismissal of appeals based solely on technicalities, especially so when the appellant had substantially complied with the formal requirements; specifically, the Court ruled that subsequent and substantial compliance may call for the relaxation of procedural rules. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- There is no dispute that Lukban belatedly filed his MR before the CA; nevertheless, there is merit to his contention that the CA should have granted his MR; time and again, the Court has relaxed the observance of procedural rules to advance substantial justice; in PNB v. Yeung, although petitioner's MR of the CA decision therein was filed out of time, the Court still gave due course to the petition in view of the substantial merits of the case; the relaxation of procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice even finds application in judgments that are already final and executory, as in Barnes v. Padilla; the instances for relaxation of the rules are present in this case; the Court opts for a liberal application of the procedural rules especially considering that the substantial merits of the case warrant its review by the Court. (Lukban vs. Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, G.R. 238563, Feb. 12, 2020)

Non-compliance to the rules 
- Procedural rules are in place to ensure the orderly, just, and speedy dispensation of cases; they are tools designed to facilitate, not hinder, the attainment of justice; thus, technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice, warrants scant consideration; therefore, litigants deserve no sympathy when they exploit the rules and resort to technicalities in order to justify wanton disregard for the orders of a court. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### PROPERTY

Acquisition of possession 
- The Court observes that Atty. Bensi was in possession of the disputed property when the complainants tried to enter and take it; complainants believed that they were the lawful owners of the property on the strength of a Partial Summary Judgment which awarded the property to Lucille's now deceased parents; nevertheless, even if the complainants are indeed the lawful owners of the disputed property, they should not have taken the law into their own hands through force; what the complainants should have done was to invoke the aid of the proper court in lawfully taking possession of the property; Article 536 of the Civil Code provides: Art. 536. In no case may possession be acquired through force or intimidation as long as there is a possessor who objects thereto; he who believes that he has an action or a right to deprive another of the holding of a thing, must invoke the aid of the competent court, if the holder should refuse to deliver the thing. (Spouses Nocuenca vs. Atty. Bensi, A.C. No. 12609, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### PROPERTY REGISTRATION DECREE (P.D. NO. 1529)

Land classification 
- In Republic of the Philippines v. T.A.N Properties, Inc., the Court ruled that it is not enough for the CENRO or the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources (PENRO) to certify that the land applied for is alienable and disposable; the Court has consistently ruled that the applicant must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy of the original land classification approved by the legal custodian of such official records to establish that the land for registration is alienable and disposable; in ruling in this wise, the Court explained that the CENRO or the PENRO are not the official repository or legal custodian of the issuances of the DENR Secretary declaring public lands as alienable and disposable; the certifications they issue relating to the character of the land cannot be considered prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein; here, the required copy of original land classification of the subject lands was not presented; both the RTC and the CA merely relied on the Certifications issued by the CENRO and the Regional Technical Director of the Lands Management Services of the DENR in ruling that the alienable and disposable nature of the subject lands was established; clearly, this is not sufficient to prove the alienability and disposability of the subject lands. (Republic vs. San Lorenzo Development Corporation (SLDC), G.R. 220902, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The fact that the alienable and disposable nature of the subject lands was not contested by the Republic in its appeal before the Court, does not have the effect of impliedly admitting, much less proving, that the subject lands are alienable and disposable; the alienability and disposability of land are not among the matters that can be established by mere admissions or even by mere agreement of the parties; the law and jurisprudence provide stringent requirements to prove such fact; this is so because no less than the Constitution, provides for the doctrine that all lands of the public domain belong to the State, which is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land; as such, the courts are not only empowered, but in fact duty-bound, to ensure that such ownership of the State is duly protected by the proper observance of the rules and requirements on land registration; the alienable and disposable character of the land must be proven by clear and incontrovertible evidence to overcome the presumption of State ownership of the lands of public domain under the Regalian doctrine; the burden of proof in overcoming such presumption is upon the person applying for registration. (Id.)

#### PUBLIC OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

Conduct 
- What is material in this case is the fact that without his marriage being first dissolved, he lived with another woman not his wife, and with whom he found another family; all government officials and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives; the good of the service and the degree of morality which every official and employee in the public service must observe, if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the Government in the enforcement of the law, demand that no untoward conduct on his part, affecting morality, integrity and efficiency while holding office should be left without proper and commensurate sanction, all attendant circumstances taken into account. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct 
- Garra is also guilty of Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct as defined under Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 15, Series of 2010, which provides: Section 1. Definition of Disgraceful and Immoral conduct - Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct refers to an act which violates the basic norm of decency, morality and decorum abhorred and condemned by the society; it refers to conduct which is willful, flagrant or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to the opinions of the good and respectable members of the community; the same Circular highlights that "disgraceful and immoral conduct may be committed in a scandalous or discreet manner, within or out of the workplace"; this Court has held in a number of cases that a man having an illicit relationship with a woman not his wife is within the purview of "disgraceful and immoral conduct" under Civil Service Laws. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct, Violation of Reasonable Rules and Regulations, and Simple Dishonesty 
- According to Section 46 B.3, Rule 10 of the RRACCS, Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct is a grave offense punishable by suspension from service for a period of six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and dismissal for the second offense; Section 46 F.3, Rule 10 of the same rules classifies Violation of Reasonable Rules and Regulations as a light offense, which is punishable by reprimand for the first offense; suspension of one (1) to thirty (30) days for the second offense; and dismissal from the service for the third offense; under CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, Simple Dishonesty is punishable by suspension of one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense; six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year suspension for the second offense; and dismissal for the third offense. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

Dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service 
- Dishonesty has been defined as the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray and an intent to violate the truth; for dishonesty to be considered serious, thus warranting the penalty of dismissal from service, the presence of any one of the following attendant circumstances must be present: (1) The dishonest act caused serious damage and grave prejudice to the Government; (2) The respondent gravely abused his authority in order to commit the dishonest act; (3) Where the respondent is an accountable officer, the dishonest act directly involves property, accountable forms or money for which he is directly accountable and the respondent shows an intent to commit material gain, graft and corruption; (4) The dishonest act exhibits moral depravity on the part of the respondent; (5) The respondent employed fraud and/or falsification of official documents in the commission of the dishonest act related to his/her employment; (6) The dishonest act was committed several times or in various occasions; (7) The dishonest act involves a Civil Service examination irregularity or fake Civil Service eligibility such as, but not limited to impersonation, cheating and use of crib sheets; (8) Other analogous circumstances; dishonesty – like bad faith 
- is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention; in evaluating such intention, the following are some considerations: the facts and circumstances giving rise to the act committed; his state of mind at the time the offense was committed; the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act; and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment; as for what specific acts constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, there is no concrete description of such under the Civil Service law and rules; jurisprudence instructs that for an act to constitute such an administrative offense, it need not be related to or connected with the public officer's official functions; what is essential is that the questioned conduct tarnishes the image and integrity of his public office. (Lukban vs. Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, G.R. 238563, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Lukban was found to have committed serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service by his having signed the "Noted by" portion of the Inspection Report Form without verifying the accuracy and truthfulness thereof, thereby facilitating the release of funds for the payment of supposedly brand-new helicopters which turned out to be secondhand units; however, a review of the functions and duties of his office leads the Court to conclude otherwise; at the time material to this case, Lukban was the Chief of the Management Division of the PNP Directorate for Comptrollership; based on the foregoing, which has not been disputed, Lukban's official duties revolve only around accounting and fund or resource management; his claim that the function of verifying the LPOH specifications belonged to different departments of the PNP is, in fact, already recognized by jurisprudence; Field Investigation Office v. Piano, cited; thus, the Court gives credence to Lukban's claim that he merely relied on the IAC Resolution as regards the compliance of the LPOHs with the NAPOLCOM specifications when he affixed his signature on the Inspection Report Form under the portion of "Noted by"; borrowing the language of the Court in Field Investigation Office v. Piano, it is the IAC that has the responsibility of inspecting the deliveries to make sure they conform to the quantity and the approved technical specifications in the supply contract and the purchase order and to accept or reject the same, and it is only after the IAC's final acceptance of the items delivered can the supplier be paid by the PNP, so that it is the IAC Resolution that constitutes "the final act for the acceptance of these helicopters for the use of the PNP, and which was the basis for the PNP to pay the price of brand new helicopters for the delivered second-hand items"; it is the considered view of the Court that Lukban cannot be held liable for serious dishonesty or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service; dishonesty – like bad faith – is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention; Lukban's acts do not show any disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray, nor any intent to violate the truth. (Id.)

Misconduct 
- Misconduct is a transgression of some established or definite rule of action; more particularly, it is an unlawful behavior by the public officer; there is evidence to support the claim that Tabasa committed an unlawful behavior against Angco; a careful perusal of the records of the case would show that there is no dispute that Tabasa deliberately touched the knee of Angco in jest and that this act was unsolicited; by his conduct, Tabasa violated the yardstick of public service imposed under Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution which enunciates the state policy of promoting a high standard of ethics and utmost responsibility in the public service; as a public servant, he is bound by the ethical standards demanded by R.A. 6713 on professionalism, justness, and sincerity; he should at all times respect the rights of others, and shall refrain from doing acts contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy, public order, public safety and public interest; unsolicited physical contact, even if done in jest, has no place in the workplace, especially in the government service. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)

Simple dishonesty 
- CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 (Rules on the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty) provides for different circumstances when Dishonesty is considered Serious, Less Serious, or Simple; Section 5 of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 provides that the presence of any of the following attendant circumstances in the commission of the dishonest act constitutes Simple Dishonesty: "(a) The dishonest act did not cause damage or prejudice to the government; (b) The dishonest act had no direct relation to or does not involve the duties and responsibilities of the respondent; (c) In falsification of any official document, where the information falsified is not related to his/her employment; (d) That the dishonest act did not result in any gain or benefit to the offender; and (e) Other analogous circumstances." (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)


- It is undisputed even by Garra that he remains legally married to Osbual; in this connection, we agree with the OAS that his deliberate omission of this fact in his SALNs for several years constitutes Dishonesty; "dishonesty has been defined as the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray and an intent to violate the truth"; applying CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, while Garra's misrepresentation or omission of his marital status in his SALNs can be considered as a dishonest act, we agree with the OAS that such act constitutes Simple Dishonesty as the same did not cause damage or prejudice to the government and had no direct relation to or did not involve the duties and responsibilities of Garra as staff driver; the same is true with the misrepresentation he committed, where the information omitted is not related to his employment. (Id.)


- Petitioners are charged for the less grave offense of simple neglect of duty, which is the failure to give attention to a task, or the disregard of a duty due to carelessness or indifference; penalized for six (6) months suspension, considering that this is their first offense after several years in public service. (Jomadiao, et al. vs. Arboleda, G.R. 230322, Feb. 19, 2020)

Violation of two (2) or more different offenses 
- Under Section 55 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, if the respondent is found guilty of two (2) or more different offenses, the imposable penalty should be for the most serious offense, while the rest shall be considered aggravating; since the penalty for Immorality (Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct) is suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day for the first offense, in consideration of the two (2) aggravating circumstances in the case at bar, we submit that the respondent be suspended for one (1) year; Garra's deliberate omissions of his marital status in his SALNs were committed not less than three (3) times, particularly, when he intentionally made such omissions in his 2007 to 2011 SALNs, including his SALNs beginning 2013; these omissions, when so treated separately, could have merited the penalty of dismissal under the RRACCS; considering his length of service, and given that his marital status is not a material component of the SALNs, the penalty of suspension for a period of one (1) year is in order. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### QUASI-DELICTS

Institution of civil case with the criminal case 
- Under the Rules, when "a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action"; however, the civil action referred to in Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the New Civil Code shall "proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a preponderance of evidence"; it is explicitly stated in Article 2177 of the Civil Code that responsibility arising from quasi-delict "is entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal Code"; the same rule finds support from Article 31 of the same Code which states that when "the civil action is based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as a felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter"; regardless of the outcome of the criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide instituted against Timtim, a civil case for quasi-delict may proceed independently against Timtim's employer, ES Trucking, under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

Presumption of negligence 
- The basis for the liability of an employer of an erring driver resulting to injury or damage to a stranger may be found in Articles 2176 and 2180 of the New Civil Code; it has been proven by preponderant evidence that Timtim recklessly drove the prime mover truck which caused the death of Catalina; although the employer is not the actual tortfeasor, the law makes the employer vicariously liable on the basis of the civil law principle of pater familias for failure to exercise due care and vigilance over the acts of one's subordinates to prevent damage to another; when the employee causes damage due to his own negligence while performing his own duties, there arises a presumption that the employer is negligent; this may be rebutted only by proof of observance of the diligence of a good father of a family; the "diligence of a good father" referred to in the last paragraph of Article 2180 means diligence in the selection and supervision of employees; in the selection of its prospective employees, the employer is required to examine them as to their qualifications, experience, and service records; ES Trucking is not only at fault for blatantly disregarding pertinent laws and rules governing trucks for hire but is also guilty of violating its undertaking to preserve the vehicle in its original state while the case is pending; ES Trucking failed to sufficiently exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its employee, Timtim. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### RAPE

Impotency as a defense 
- Accused-appellant attempts to cast doubt on his conviction by arguing that his advanced age made erection—and thus, sex—impossible; this argument is unmeritorious; impotence must be proven with certainty in order to overcome the presumption of potency; in rape cases, impotency as a defense must be proven with certainty to overcome the presumption in favor of potency; here, the evidence proffered by the defense failed to discharge such burden. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### RAPE UNDER ARTICLE 266-A IN RELATION TO ARTICLE 266-B OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE (RPC)

Rape via sexual intercourse distinguished from sexual assault 
- Rape via sexual intercourse is committed only by a man through the penile penetration of the woman victim's vagina; on the other hand, sexual assault may be committed by either a man or a woman against a man or a woman through the insertion of the penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or the insertion of any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; the Information charged accused-appellant with rape through carnal knowledge; however, the pieces of evidence disclose that accused-appellant inserted his finger, not his penis, into the vagina of AAA, without her consent, by threatening to kill AAA and her family if she did not submit to his bestial desires; however, accused-appellant cannot be convicted of sexual assault considering that the latter crime has been held not to be included in rape via sexual intercourse given the essential difference in the means of commission (penile penetration v. object penetration). (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### RAPE UNDER ARTICLE 266-A IN RELATION TO ARTICLE 266-B OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AS AMENDED BY R.A. 8353 (THE ANTI-RAPE LAW OF 1997)

Penalty and civil liability 
- This Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for rape through sexual intercourse under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the RPC, amended by R.A. 8353; in Criminal Case No. P-4357, the Court finds the penalty of reclusion perpetua in order; the award of Php75,000.00 each in civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages is likewise sustained being in accordance with current jurisprudence. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### RAPE UNDER ARTICLE 266-A(1) OF THE RPC, AS AMENDED BY R.A. 8353 (THE ANTI-RAPE LAW OF 1997)

Elements 
- To obtain a conviction for a charge of rape under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, the prosecution must establish that: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) he accomplished this act under the circumstances mentioned in the provision, e.g., through force, threat or intimidation; the gravamen of rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will; the Court agrees that the prosecution had adequately proven accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for rape committed on 02 January 2010; AAA's testimony, corroborated by Dr. Celzo's medical findings, clearly established that accused-appellant had sexual intercourse with AAA, without the latter's consent; having instilled fear of physical harm against AAA's person and her family, accused-appellant successfully cowed AAA and led her to believe that she had no choice but to do accused-appellant's bidding. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LAW (ACT NO. 3135)

Extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage 
- It is already a settled rule that a buyer in a foreclosure sale becomes the absolute owner of the property purchased if no redemption is made within one year from the registration of the sale; being the absolute owner, he is entitled to all the rights of ownership over the property including the right of possession; the buyer can demand possession of the land even during the redemption period except that he has to post a bond pursuant to Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended; the bond is no longer required after the redemption period if the property is not redeemed; a writ of possession is a writ of execution used to enforce a judgment for the recovery of possession of a land; it instructs the sheriff to enter the subject land and gives its possession to the one entitled to under the judgment; further, a writ of possession may be issued in favor of the successful buyer in a foreclosure sale of REM either (1) within the one-year redemption period, upon the filing of a bond by the buyer; or (2) after the redemption period, with no bond required; the duty of the court to issue a writ of possession is ministerial and may not be stayed by a pending action for annulment of the mortgage or the foreclosure itself; the only exception is when a third party is actually holding the property by adverse title or right. (HH & Co. Agricultural Corporation vs. Perlas, G.R. 217095, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (RTC)

Jurisdiction 
- As conferred by Section 19 of B.P. Blg. 129, the RTC has jurisdiction over all civil cases in which the subject matter under litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation; one of which, as established by jurisprudence, is a complaint for injunction; it is a well-settled rule that jurisdiction of the court is determined by the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought; here, the principal action is one for injunction, which is within the jurisdiction of the RTC; in determining the jurisdiction of the RTC, what is controlling is the principal action, and not the ancilliary remedy which is merely an incident thereto. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)


- Both the trial court and the respondents justify CIAC jurisdiction over the case at bar by citing the construction tribunal's expertise in handling factual circumstances involving construction matters; such justification loses sight of the fact that a trial court's main function is passing upon questions of fact; time and again, this Court has held that factual matters are best ventilated before the trial court, as it has the power to receive and evaluate evidence first-hand; that the dispute at bar involves technical matters does not automatically divest the trial court of its jurisdiction; the court a quo has ample means of handling such technical matters, as it may utilize expert testimony or appoint commissioners to handle the technical matters involved in the suit; the core issue of this suit is whether or not the construction activities of respondents caused the damage to the spouses Ang's house; and the resolution of this mixed question of fact and law is well within the jurisdiction of the court a quo to decide. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### RES JUDICATA

Bar by prior judgment 
- Even assuming that the Court of Appeals correctly categorized respondents defense as res judicata through bar by prior judgment, it would still not lie; this principle requires a prior valid judgment issued by a tribunal having jurisdiction over the subject matter; under the 2003 Rules of Procedure, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) has jurisdiction over cases "involving the ejectment and dispossession of tenants and/or leaseholders" or "the review of leasehold rentals"; this controversy arose precisely because respondents never submitted the property to the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), as required by the Compromise Agreement; the DARAB assumed jurisdiction over respondents' action based on a condition in the Compromise Agreement that respondents never actually fulfilled; Department of Agrarian Reform v. Paramount Holdings Equities, cited. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- Here, the Court of Appeals seems to have confused the two concepts; "the resolution on the second case . . . as to whether respondents may be obliged to comply with the assailed provision in the Compromise Agreement, i.e., to offer the land to the government under the Voluntary Offer to Sell scheme, essentially hinges on the rights that have been previously determined with finality in the first case; while the identity of the parties is the same, the rights asserted and the reliefs prayed for are different in the two cases; the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board has no jurisdiction over an action for specific performance; the finality of the first case would not bar the adjudication of the present case. (Id.)


- Res judicata applies in the concept of "bar by prior judgment" if the following requisites concur: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) the judgment or order must be on the merits; (3) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and (4) there must be, between the first and the second action, identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action; all of the elements of the doctrine of res judicata are present in this case; considering that the only issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 126282, and consequently, the present petition, is the propriety of the issuance of the writ of attachment, a subsequent resolution of that issue already resolved by the Court in G.R. 243036 is conclusive on and bars the resolution of the present petition. (Burgundy Realty Corporation, et al. vs. MAA General Assurance Phils., Inc., G.R. 225610, Feb. 19, 2020)

Concept 
- "Res judicata (meaning, a "matter adjudged") is a fundamental principle of law that precludes parties from re-litigating issues actually litigated and determined by a prior and final judgment"; in Degayo v. Magbanua-Dinglasan, the Court explained the effect of res judicata: It rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate; the doctrine of res judicata is set forth in Section 47 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Res judicata is a legal principle where a party is barred from raising an issue or presenting evidence on a fact that has already been judicially tried and decided; "a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment"; application of the principle, provided under Rule 39, Section 47 of the Rules of Court; as explained in P.D. No. 1271 Committee v. De Guzman, res judicata is premised on the idea that judgments must be final and conclusive; otherwise, there would be no end to litigation; in applying res judicata, courts must first distinguish between two (2) concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment; and (2) conclusiveness of judgment; in Spouses Aboitiz v. Spouses Po, this Court explained the difference between the two: Res judicata in the concept of bar by prior judgment proscribes the filing of another action based on "the same claim, demand, or cause of action"; it applies when the following are present: (a) there is a final judgment or order; (b) it is a judgment or order on the merits; (c) it was "rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties"; and (d) there is "identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action" between the first and second actions; res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment applies when there is an identity of issues in two (2) cases between the same parties involving different causes of action. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- Since the Court of Appeals reasoned that the specific performance case would involve a re-litigation of the same facts or issues as the recovery of possession case, the more accurate concept would have been conclusiveness of judgment; in Spouses Antonio v. de Monje: Where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein; concept of res judicata known as "conclusiveness of judgment"; any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same; conclusiveness of judgment finds application when a fact or question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and adjudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction; the fact or question settled by final judgment or order binds the parties to that action (and persons in privity with them or their successors-in-interest), and continues to bind them while the judgment or order remains standing and unreversed by proper authority on a timely motion or petition; only the identities of parties and issues are required for the operation of the principle of conclusiveness of judgment. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The doctrine of res judicata refers to the rule that a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit; it rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate. (Burgundy Realty Corporation, et al. vs. MAA General Assurance Phils., Inc., G.R. 225610, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The issue raised in petitioner's action for specific performance is whether respondents can be compelled to comply with the stipulations in the Compromise Agreement; the trial court must address the preliminary issue of whether respondents actually complied with the stipulations in the Compromise Agreement; this must be conclusively resolved first before the Decision in the recovery of possession case can operate as res judicata through conclusiveness of judgment; a review of its Decision, however, shows that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) never actually passed upon the issue of compliance; the Compromise Agreement shows that its main intent was to prevent petitioners' predecessors-in-interest, the disputed lot's actual occupants and cultivators, from being displaced; it expressly mandated that they "shall not be displaced and transferred to any area without their respective consent"; by instituting the case for recovery of possession, respondents would have violated the stipulations of the Compromise Agreement, since a favorable decision has the effect of displacing petitioners' predecessors-in-interest without their consent; the DARAB's Decision had no effect on the validity of the Compromise Agreement, because the ruling did not pass upon any of its stipulations; petitioners, as the successors-in-interest, could institute an action for the enforcement of the Compromise Agreement. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- There are two (2) concepts of res judicata: 1) bar by prior judgment, which is found in Section 47(b) of Rule 39; and 2) conclusiveness of judgment, which is referred to in paragraph c of the same rule and section; distinction discussed in Puerto Azul Land, Inc. v. Pacific Wide Realty Dev't. Corp.: There is a bar by prior judgment where there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred; there is conclusiveness of judgment, on the other hand, where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action; res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment applies in this case; both the present case and Civil Case No. 12-128721 involve the same parties and subject matter; only the cause of action is different; res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment "precludes the relitigation only of a particular fact or issue necessary to the outcome of a prior action between the same parties on a different claim or cause of action." (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### RESISTANCE OR DISOBEDIENCE TO A PERSON IN AUTHORITY OR HIS AGENT

Elements 
- Resistance or disobedience is punished under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code; two (2) key elements must be shown: "(1) That a person in authority or his agent is engaged in the performance of official duty or gives a lawful order to the offender; and (2) That the offender resists or seriously disobeys such person or his agent"; based on the circumstances, petitioner's resistance and use of force are not so serious to be deemed as direct assault; while she exerted force, it is not dangerous, grave, or severe enough to warrant the penalties attached to the crime; thus, instead of direct assault, this Court convicts petitioner of resistance or disobedience; here, although the charge is direct assault, the prosecution was able to prove resistance or disobedience; these offenses have similar elements, varying only as to the degree of seriousness of the offender's resistance; direct assault necessarily includes resistance or disobedience; petitioner is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of resistance or disobedience under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code; penalty. (Mallari vs. People, G.R. 224679, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### REVISED RULES ON ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE (RRACCS)

Gross Neglect of Duty, Grave Misconduct, and Serious Dishonesty 
- Under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), Gross Neglect of Duty, Grave Misconduct, and Serious Dishonesty are grave offenses which are punishable by dismissal from the service; also, the following administrative disabilities shall be imposed: (1) cancellation of eligibility; (2) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; (3) perpetual disqualification from holding public office; and (4) bar from taking civil service examinations; the penalty of fine should be imposed; and the amount of which lies within the Sound discretion of the Court; Section 51(d) of the RRACCS provides that the penalty of fine shall be in an amount not exceeding six months' salary of respondent; penalty of fine equivalent to Uyan's salary for one month which shall be deducted from his accrued leave benefits in view of the mitigating circumstances of advanced age and his length of service. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Salunoy, Court Stenographer, A.M. No. P-07-2354, Feb. 4, 2020)

Violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations 
- By his own admission that he entered the premises of Sampaga's quarters in Room 110 instead of meeting her in the lounge as required by the House Rules, Garra is deemed liable for Violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations under Section 46(F)(3), Rule 10 of the RRACCS; whether Sampaga is Garra's legal or common-law spouse is of no moment; the rules are clear that all guests, regardless of their relation to the occupants of the PHILJA Training Center, are only allowed to conduct visits in the lounge. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE

Commission of 
- The Information charged appellants with Robbery with Homicide and Frustrated Homicide; however, the Court ruled in People v. Tidong, viz.: There is no special complex crime of robbery with homicide and double frustrated homicide; the offense should have been designated as robbery with homicide alone, regardless of the number of homicides or injuries committed; these other felonies have, at the most and under appropriate circumstances, been considered merely as generic aggravating circumstances which can be offset by mitigating circumstances; the term "homicide" in paragraph 1 of Article 294 is used in its generic sense, that is, any act that results in death; any other act producing injuries short of death is integrated in the "homicide" committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, assuming, of course, that the homicide is consummated; if no death supervenes, the accused should be held liable for separate crimes of robbery and frustrated or attempted homicide or murder (provided that there was intent to kill) if the latter offenses were not necessary for the commission of the robbery, or for a complex crime of robbery and frustrated or attempted homicide or murder under Article 48 of the Code if the latter offenses were the necessary means for the commission of robbery. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

Elements 
- Robbery with homicide exists when a homicide is committed either by reason, or on occasion, of the robbery; to sustain a conviction for robbery with homicide, the prosecution must prove the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property belonging to another; (2) with intent to gain; (3) with the use of violence or intimidation against a person; and (4) on the occasion or by reason of the robbery, the crime of homicide, as used in the generic sense, was committed; a conviction needs certainty that the robbery is the central purpose and objective of the malefactor and the killing is merely incidental to the robbery; the intent to rob must precede the taking of human life but the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

Penalty 
- As regards the penalty imposed, we agree with the CA that the death penalty should have been imposed, if not for the proscription in R.A. 9346, since the crime was committed by a band and with the use of an unlicensed firearm; accordingly, appellants were correctly meted the penalty of reclusion perpetua but they are not eligible for parole; moreover, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, the damages awarded must be further modified as follows: The award of civil indemnity is increased to P100,000.00 for each victim; moral damages and exemplary damages of P100,000.00 each for each victim are awarded; finally, all these damages shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6 percent ) per annum from date of finality of this judgment until full payment. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### RULES OF PROCEDURE

Death of a party 
- Section 16, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court lays down the procedure for the substitution of a party-litigant who dies during the pendency of a case; thus, when a party to a case dies, his or her counsel is charged with the duty of informing the trial court of, first, the fact of the litigant's death and, second, the name and address of the litigant's representative; the court must then issue an order requiring the said representative to appear and formally be substituted; however, if no representative is so named or if he or she does not appear, the court may direct the adverse party to procure an executor or administrator, who will be tasked to represent the deceased party until the case is terminated. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### SAFE SPACES ACT (R.A. 11313)

Duties of an employer 
- In recognizing the need to address these concerns, the State's policy against sexual harassment has been strengthened through R.A. 11313, otherwise known as the Safe Spaces Act; this law has expanded the definition of gender-based sexual harassment in the workplace and has added to the duties of an employer as to its prevention, deterrence, and punishment; it explicitly requires that complaints be investigated and resolved within 10 days or less upon its reporting; it likewise expressly provides for the liability of employers and duties of co-workers as to sexual harassment; the law likewise specifies the confidentiality of proceedings, and the issuance of a restraining order for the offended person; moreover, it allows local government units to impose heavier penalties on perpetrators; while this law does not apply to this case as it was enacted after the commission of Batucan's acts, its principles emphasize the need to accord more importance to complaints of sexual harassment and recognize the severity of the offense. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### SALES

Contract to sell 
- Based on the parties' allegations, the key issue pertains to the applicability of Olivarez Realty Corporation v. Castillo, which similarly involves the retention of partial payments made on a failed contract to sell; Olivarez involved the sale of a parcel of land, which the buyer undertook to pay in several installments; the parties executed a deed of conditional sale, stipulating that in addition to the installment payments, the buyer would also institute the necessary legal actions to clear the property of tenants, and of an adverse claim by the Philippine Tourism Authority; it was also stipulated that the buyer could immediately take possession of the property after signing the deed of conditional sale, which it did; however, the deed of absolute sale would be executed by the seller only after the full payment of the purchase price; while the buyer was able to pay a portion of the agreed purchase price, it failed to pay the succeeding installments and to institute the legal action required under the contract; this led the seller to rescind the contract; however, in view of the buyer's 14-year occupancy of the premises without full payment of the purchase price, the sellers also sought to have the partial payments forfeited in their favor; the foregoing circumstances allowed this Court to rule that the contract between the parties in Olivarez was a contract to sell; Olivarez also cited the case of Gomez v. Court of Appeals, where this Court clarified that partial payments on a failed contract to sell may be retained by the seller as "reasonable compensation for use of the property." (Spouses Godinez vs. Spouses Norman, G.R. 225449, Feb. 26, 2020)


- This Court finds the application of Olivarez in order; here, petitioners turned over possession of the premises to respondents after the latter made partial payments amounting to USD10,000.00; respondents then moved their furniture and groceries into one of the housing unit's rooms and also hired a house helper to watch over the premises in the interim; respondents made subsequent payments, bringing its total to USD40,000.00, but the contract to sell still failed to take effect because of respondents' subsequent default in paying the balance; during this five (5) month period, petitioners were unable to enjoy their property despite retaining a key to the premises; thus, petitioners should have been compensated for respondents' use of the property, consistent with Olivarez; the conversion of partial payments into rentals is also consistent with Article 1378 of the Civil Code, which teaches that doubts in the interpretation of onerous contracts "should be settled in favor of the greatest reciprocity of interests"; We find it only proper that respondents reciprocate their use of the premises with the payment of rentals while full payment on their contract to sell was still pending; Olivarez also recognized that compensation for use of the property must be reasonable; in Olivarez, this Court allowed the seller to retain the partial payments because the buyers possessed and used the property without paying rentals; likewise, Gomez considered the "benefits, financial or otherwise" enjoyed by the buyer in determining whether or not to retain partial payments as reasonable compensation; in both cases, the sellers were unable to use their respective properties because the buyers were in possession thereof. (Id.)


- While there is no definitive legal standard for computing reasonable rentals on residential properties, this Court notes that USD40,000.00 amounts to 22.9 percent , or over a fifth, of the total purchase price of petitioner's housing unit, which is not commensurate to the value respondents may have derived from their four (4) month possession of the property; while respondents' possession prevented petitioners from using the premises, even petitioners recognized that respondents did not actually occupy the housing unit; there is also no evidence before this Court indicating the "benefits, financial or otherwise," that respondents may have derived from their possession; thus, respondents' limited use of the premises requires us to temper the amount of partial payments that petitioners may reasonably retain; determining reasonable rentals would depend on the circumstances of the parties, the nature of the property being rented, and the prevailing situation in the relevant market at the time of the transaction, among others; ordinarily, this would require reception of evidence, and thus, a remand of the case to the lower courts; however, in order to speedily dispose of this case, and in view of the time already spent litigating this issue, a recourse to the analogous case of Olivarez is proper; in Olivarez, this Court effectively allowed the prospective seller to convert partial payments to rentals, with such rentals amounting to 13.1 percent  of the property's total purchase price; having already determined the applicability of the Olivarez ruling on the retention of partial payments, the circumstances of this case would warrant the retention of a similar amount; thus, rentals for the housing unit may be set at 13.1 percent  of the USD175,000.00 total purchase price, or USD22,925.00; petitioners may, therefore, retain USD22,925.00 of the USD40,000.00 partially paid by respondents, but must return the remaining USD17,075.00 to respondents. (Id.)

Sale of a piece of land or interest thereon through an agent 
- When the sale of a piece of land or any interest thereon is through an agent, the authority of the latter shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void; this authority must be contained in a special power of attorney, that is, a specific written grant of authority in favor of an agent to sell a piece of land belonging to the principal; for the principal to confer the right upon an agent to sell real estate, a power of attorney must so express the powers of the agent in clear and unmistakable language; when there is any reasonable doubt that the language so used conveys such power, no such construction shall be given the document. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### SEAFARERS

Death benefits 
- Crucial to the determination of petitioner's entitlement to death benefits as well as her right to get reimbursement for transportation and burial expenses she incurred are Sections 18.1b, 21, 22, and 25 of the CBA; the cause of death of the seafarer is immaterial to the determination of petitioner's entitlement to the said benefits; it is clear from the express provision of Section 25.1 of the CBA that respondents hold themselves liable for death benefits for the death of the seafarer under their employ for any cause; under Annex 4 of the CBA, the same shall be in the amount of USD89,100.00; respondents also obligated themselves to pay the transportation expenses for the repatriation of the body of the deceased, as well as the burial expenses; Sections 21 and 22 of the CBA did not limit the liability of the respondents to deaths that are directly attributable to sickness or injury, but rather widens its coverage to also include seafarers who died or signed off due to sickness or injury; it is settled that in the event that the clauses in the CBA provide for greater benefits to the seafarer, the same must prevail over the standard terms and benefits formulated by the POEA in its Standard Employment Contract inasmuch as a contract of labor is so impressed with public interest that the more beneficial conditions must be endeavored in favor of the laborer; maximum aid and full protection to labor enshrined in Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### SEARCH WARRANT

Service of 
- Section 9, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court states: Section 9. Time of making search. – The warrant must direct that it be served in the day time, unless the affidavit asserts that the property is on the person or in the place ordered to be searched, in which case a direction may be inserted that it be served at any time of the day or night; in People v. Court of Appeals, the Court explained that a search warrant, as an exception, may be enforced at any reasonable hour of the day or night, to wit: The general rule is that search warrants must be served during the daytime; however, the rule allows an exception, namely, a search at any reasonable hour of the day or night, when the application asserts that the property is on the person or place ordered to be searched; in this case, the search warrant stated that the search shall be made at "ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT"; the RTC Cebu City issued the search warrant based on the deposition of PO3 Arturo Enriquez and PO3 Jesus Manulat, which stated that they allegedly bought shabu from petitioner at about 9:00 in the evening; thus, the RTC Cebu City had basis to state that the search warrant may also be implemented at dawn or early morning. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### SELF-DEFENSE

As a justifying circumstance 
- Considering that self-defense is an affirmative allegation, and totally exonerates the accused from any criminal liability, it is well settled that when it is invoked, the burden of evidence shifts to the accused to prove it by credible, clear and convincing evidence; the accused claiming self-defense must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution; self-defense cannot be justifiably appreciated when uncorroborated by independent and competent evidence, or when it is extremely doubtful by itself. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The nature, character, location and extent of these wounds belie accused-appellant's claim that Olipio attacked him with a bolo; and it was in self-defense that after wrestling the bolo from the victim, accused-appellant used it against the latter; the appearances of the wounds on the victim's heart, his internal organs and large intestine contradict accused-appellant's defense that he had only hit Olipio twice in the stomach and that after the second blow, both of them fell and rolled on the ground which caused the wounds at the back; assuming that Olipio was the aggressor, it is nevertheless apparent that at the time he was killed, the danger to accused-appellant had already ceased; even after taking full control of the bolo, he attacked the victim several times and stabbed him to death; settled is the rule that when the unlawful aggression ceases, the defender no longer has any right to kill or wound the former aggressor; otherwise, retaliation and not self-defense is committed. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

Elements 
- By invoking the justifying circumstance of self-defense, accused-appellant thus admits committing the acts constituting the crime for which he was charged and the burden of proof is on him to establish, by clear and convincing proof, that (1) there was unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) the reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) the lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)


- The essential elements of self-defense are the following: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression, and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself; to successfully invoke self-defense, there must have been an unlawful and unprovoked attack that endangered the life of the accused, who was then forced to inflict severe wounds upon the assailant by employing reasonable means to resist the attack; while all three elements must concur, first and foremost self-defense relies on proof of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; unlawful aggression is a condition sine qua non for upholding the justifying circumstance of self-defense; if there is nothing to prevent or repel, the other two requisites of self-defense will have no basis. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSONS

Jurisdiction of probate courts 
- In Bernardo v. Court of Appeals, this Court held that the question of ownership of certain properties, whether they belong to the conjugal partnership or to the husband exclusively, is within the jurisdiction of the probate court, which necessarily has to liquidate the conjugal partnership in order to determine the estate of the decedent: The jurisdiction to try controversies between heirs of a deceased person regarding the ownership of properties alleged to belong to his estate has been recognized to be vested in probate courts; this is so because the purpose of an administration proceeding is the liquidation of the estate and distribution of the residue among the heirs and legatees; liquidation means determination of all the assets of the estate and payment of all the debts and expenses; thereafter, distribution is made of the decedent's liquidated estate among the persons entitled to succeed him; the proceeding is in the nature of an action of partition in which each party is required to bring into the mass whatever community property he has in his possession; to this end and as a necessary corollary, the interested parties may introduce proofs relative to the ownership of the properties in dispute; all the heirs who take part in the distribution of the decedent's estate are before the court, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, in all matters and incidents necessary to the complete settlement of such estate, so long as no interests of third parties are affected. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In Heirs of Reyes v. Reyes, this Court affirmed the probate court's provisional inclusion of properties to the deceased's estate, without prejudice to the outcome of a separate action to determine ownership, because the properties were still titled under the Torrens system in the names of the deceased and his spouse; unlike in Heirs of Reyes, the parcels of land in this case were already titled in respondent's name alone; thus, to determine the issue of ownership in a separate proceeding would be unnecessary; it is settled that the "certificate of title is the best evidence of ownership of a property"; thus, the titles issued to respondent, being Torrens titles, are conclusive upon the parties: In regard to such incident of inclusion or exclusion, We hold that if a property covered by Torrens Title is involved, the presumptive conclusiveness of such title should be given due weight, and in the absence of strong compelling evidence to the contrary, the holder thereof should be considered as the owner of the property in controversy until his or her title is nullified or modified in an appropriate ordinary action, particularly, when as in the case at bar, possession of the property itself is in the persons named in the title. (Id.)

Titles of properties 
- As a general rule, the question as to titles of properties should not be passed upon in testate or intestate proceedings, but should be ventilated in a separate action; however, for purposes of expediency and convenience, this general rule is subject to exceptions, such that: (1) "the probate court may provisionally pass upon in an intestate or testate proceeding the question of inclusion in, or exclusion from, the inventory of a piece of property without prejudice to its final determination in a separate action"; and (2) the probate court is competent to decide the question of ownership "if the interested parties are all heirs, or the question is one of collation or advancement, or the parties consent" to the probate court's assumption of jurisdiction and "the rights of third parties are not impaired." (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### SHARI'A DISTRICT COURT

Jurisdiction 
- A probate court's determination of ownership over properties forming part of the estate is only provisional; as explained in Romero v. Court of Appeals, "this rule is applicable only as between the representatives of the estate and strangers thereto"; since petitioners and respondent are all heirs and parties in the settlement proceeding of Mahid's estate, petitioners should have contested the exclusion of the properties before the Shari'a District Court, then acting as a probate court; however, they did not lift a finger to ask the probate court to include the properties in the inventory; by failing to do so, petitioners are deemed to have acquiesced to the exclusion of the properties from the inventory, along with respondent's ownership over them; in Pacioles, Jr. v. Chuatoco-Ching, where the respondent and her representative could have opposed the petitioner's inventory and sought the exclusion of the properties she considered hers, but instead adopted the inventory, this Court held that she and her representative acquiesced with petitioner's inventory. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The Code of Muslim Personal Laws provides that "the Shari'a District Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all cases involving disposition, distribution and settlement of the estate of deceased Muslims, probate of wills, issuance of letters of administration or appointment of administrators or executors regardless of the nature or the aggregate value of the property"; its decisions shall be final, except when it shall affect the original and appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in the Constitution; the Shari'a District Court, acting as a probate court, issued an Omnibus Order on October 15, 2008 approving the inventory of Mahid's estate, which excluded the two (2) parcels of land in respondent's name; in another Order, it ruled upon the Writ of Possession on the same parcels of land; thus, the Shari'a District Court acted pursuant to the Code of Muslim Personal Laws, which provides: ARTICLE 38. Regime of property relations. 
- The property relations between the spouses, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary in the marriage settlements or any other contract, shall be governed by the regime of complete separation of property in accordance with this Code and, in a suppletory manner, by the general principles of Islamic law and the Civil Code of the Philippines; considering that the interested parties here are all heirs of the decedent and there are no third parties whose rights will be impaired, this case falls under the exception to the general rule; the Shari'a District Court properly exercised its jurisdiction when it passed upon the question of title and excluded the parcels of land in respondent's name from the inventory of Mahid's estate; per the Code of Muslim Personal Laws, its decision shall be final. (Id.)

#### SPECIAL PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AGAINST CHILD ABUSE, EXPLOITATION AND DISCRIMINATION ACT (R.A. 7610)

Lascivious conduct under Section 5 (b) 
- Pueyo's liability for fines in view of People v. Cadiente, Olivares v. Court of Appeals, and Amployo v. People is further increased; In the said cases, this Court affirmed the trial court's imposition of the discretionary fine provided under Section 31(f), Article XII of R.A. 7610 against offenders under Section 5(b) of the same law for the rehabilitation of the child victims; the gravity of the case at hand cannot be discounted; AAA's potential trauma from her genital damage, as indiscriminately inflicted upon her by Pueyo when she was only six years old, is a burden that AAA may likely suffer throughout her formative years or even for the rest of her life; We hold that Pueyo be made liable for the additional fine of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) pursuant to Section 31 (f), Article XII of R.A. 7610. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The case of People v. Tulagan reconciled the provisions of acts of lasciviousness, rape via carnal knowledge and sexual assault in the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, vis-à-vis R.A. 7610; this Court reiterated the guidelines in People v. Caoili in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, and in determining the proper penalty, viz: 1. The age of the victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty. 2. If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610"; pursuant to the second proviso in said Section 5(b), the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period. 3. If the victim is exactly twelve (12) years of age, or more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years of age, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610," and the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua; since AAA was 13 years old at the time of the commission of the crime, as shown by her birth certificate, the proper designation of the crime committed is lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610; thus, in Criminal Case No. P-4356, this Court finds accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the said offense. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court finds that based on the facts established, accused-appellant may still be convicted of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610; while the Information in Criminal Case No. P-4356 alleges the elements of rape through sexual intercourse, the prosecution was able to prove during trial that accused-appellant committed lascivious acts against AAA; the kissing of a minor victim's lips, mashing of her breast and insertion of the offender's finger into the victim's vagina, have been held to constitute lascivious conduct within the purview of Section 2(h) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases, in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, which defines lascivious conduct as: The intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of an person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; in People v. Caoili, the Court held that an accused may be held guilty of acts of lasciviousness performed on a child, i.e., lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, which was the offense proved, because it is included in rape, the offense charged. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

Violation of Section 5 (B) 
- People v. Dagsa sets the parameters in determining whether there is a violation of Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, viz.: The essential elements of this provision are: 1. The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct. 2. The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse. 3. The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age; as to the first element, paragraph (h), Section 2 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 7610 defines lascivious conduct as a crime committed through the intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks with the intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, among others; the second element requires that the lascivious conduct be committed on a child who is either exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; this second element requires evidence proving that: (a) [the victim] was either exploited in prostitution or subjected to sexual abuse; and (b) [the victim] is a child as defined under R.A. 7610. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

Violation of Section 10 (a) 
- The courts below found Pueyo criminally liable under Section 10 (a), R.A. 7610, which require the following elements: (1) AAA's minority; (2) the acts constituting physical abuse committed by Pueyo against AAA; and (3) the fact that the said acts are clearly punishable under R.A. 7610; the fact of minority of AAA is long settled, her being six years old at the time of the incident and eight years old when she took the witness stand; it was likewise established that Pueyo physically abused AAA when he poked her genitals with a welding rod, an act that is plainly child abuse as contemplated under Section 3(b) of R.A. 7610. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### STATUTORY RAPE

Commission of 
- In the 2017 cases of People v. Deniega and People v. Niebres, the Court held that sexual intercourse with a mental retardate whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape; these cases cite People v. Quintos, which provided for the distinctions between "deprived of reason," "demented" and "mental retardation"; to quote: The term, "deprived of reason," is associated with insanity or madness; a person deprived of reason has mental abnormalities that affect his or her reasoning and perception of reality and, therefore, his or her capacity to resist, make decisions, and give consent; the term "demented," refers to a person who suffers from a mental condition called dementia; dementia refers to the deterioration or loss of mental functions such as memory, learning, speaking, and social condition, which impairs one's independence in everyday activities; the terms, "mental retardation" or "intellectual disability," had been classified under "deprived of reason"; the terms, "deprived of reason" and "demented," however, should be differentiated from the term, "mentally retarded" or "intellectually disabled"; an intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived of reason or demented; a person's capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her chronological age but by his or her mental age; in determining whether a person is "twelve (12) years of age" under Article 266-A(1)(d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is established. (People vs. Castillo, G.R. 242276, Feb. 18, 2020)

Elements 
- As regards rape of a mental retardate, the Court now holds that, following People v. Quintos, when the victim is a mental retardate whose mental age is that of a person below 12 years old, the rape should be classified as statutory rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the RPC, as amended; statutory rape is committed when (1) the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age, and (2) the accused had carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation, whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness, or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority; what the law punishes in statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below twelve (12) years old; force, intimidation and physical evidence of injury are not relevant considerations; the only pertinent concern is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge indeed took place. (People vs. Castillo, G.R. 242276, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The prosecution satisfactorily established the mental age of the victim; Dr. Manalo conducted a battery of tests to determine the mental age, social maturity and emotional condition of AAA; Dr. Manalo testified that based on her examination, AAA has a mental age of a 5-year-old; the prosecution also established the elements of statutory rape; first, AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the person who molested her; AAA became pregnant and gave birth to a boy later on; AAA's testimony is sufficient to convict accused-appellant of rape; the nature of the crime of rape often entails reliance on the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the victim, which is sufficient for a conviction, provided that such testimony is clear, convincing, and otherwise consistent with human nature; questions on the credibility of witnesses should best be addressed to the trial court because of its unique position to observe that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying which is denied to the appellate courts; the rule is even more stringently applied if the appellate court has concurred with the trial court. (Id.)

#### STATUTORY RAPE BY SEXUAL ASSAULT IN RELATION TO R.A. 7610

Elements 
- The following are the elements of statutory rape by sexual assault as defined under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC and established by jurisprudence: (1) That the offender commits an act of sexual assault; (2) That the act of sexual assault is committed by any of the following means: (a) By inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice; or (b) By inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; (3) That the act of sexual assault is accomplished under any of the following circumstances: (a) By using force and intimidation; (b) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; or (d) When the woman is under 12 years of age or demented; the acts of Pueyo have been shown to fall within the punitive purview of rape by sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610; the similar case of People v. Tulagan dictates the indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years, ten (10) months, and twenty-one (21) days of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months, and twenty (20) days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, as the correct penalty therefor.

- Various circulars were issued by this Court as guidance as regards the handling and management of court funds: (1) OCA Circular No. 50-95 which provides for guidelines and procedures in the manner of collecting and depositing court funds; (2) OCA Circular No. 113-2004 which orders the submission of Monthly Reports of Collections and Deposits; (3) Administrative Circular No. 35-2004 which states the duty of the Clerk of Court as regards the keeping of a cash book and cash collection to be deposited with the Land Bank of the Philippines; (4) Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 which among others requires the upkeep of a book embodying all the fees received and collected by the court and demands that all fiduciary collection shall be immediately deposited by the clerk of court, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank; (5) Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92 which provides for the duty of the clerk of court to make the necessary deposits of the court's collection from bail bonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collection; (6) Supreme Court Circular No. 5-93 which requires the clerk of court to deposit court collections with Land Bank of the Philippines or with the Municipal, City or Provincial Treasurer as the case may be; and (7) The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court which states the guidelines for the accounting of court funds; sufficiency in number of these issuances seeks to emphasize not only the administration of court funds, but also the accountability of court employees. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Salunoy, Court Stenographer, A.M. No. P-07-2354, Feb. 4, 2020)

Power of administrative supervision 
- The retirement program budgets of retiring Justices of collegiate courts are not expressly provided under any law; they are not part of the "retirement and other benefits" to which the statutes pertain, viz., pensions, lump sums, and survivorship; such retirement program budgets are more in the nature of administrative expenses which are allotted by the collegiate courts, with the approval of this Court En Banc, to their respective retiring members in order to recognize and celebrate the latter's service and contribution to the Judiciary, in particular, and the public, in general; there being no explicit statutory mandate that the Justices of the collegiate courts are entitled to retirement program budgets, then, there is also no basis for them to legally demand that such budgets be equal across collegiate courts of the same rank or level; the retirement program budgets of Justices of collegiate courts are subject to the discretion and approval of this Court, as part of its constitutional power of administrative supervision over all courts and personnel thereof; in the exercise of such discretion, the Court takes into consideration several factors, such as, but not limited to, the established or actual costs of the items and activities which are part of the retirement program, the number of employees of the collegiate court, the period of time since the last increase in the retirement program budget, and the availability of funds. (Re: Expenses of Retirement of Court of Appeals Justices, A.M. No. 19-02-03-CA, Feb. 11, 2020)

#### TAX EXEMPTION

Requirements for exemption 
- BIR rulings are the official position of the Bureau to queries raised by taxpayers and other stakeholders relative to clarification and interpretation of tax laws; the primary purpose of a BIR Ruling is simply to determine whether a certain transaction, under the law, is taxable or not based on the circumstances provided by the taxpayer; as admitted by the CIR, rulings merely operate to "confirm" the existence of the conditions for exemption provided under the law; if all the requirements for exemption set forth under the law are complied with, the transaction is considered exempt, whether or not a prior BIR ruling was secured by the taxpayer; in practice, a taxpayer often secures a BIR ruling, prior to entering into a transaction, to prepare for any tax liability; however, in case a taxpayer already paid the tax, believing to be liable therefor, and later on files a claim for refund on the basis of an exemption provided under the law, requiring a prior BIR ruling as a condition for the approval of the refund claim is clearly illogical; there is nothing in Section 40(C)(2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, which requires the taxpayer to first secure a prior confirmatory ruling before the transaction may be considered as a tax-free exchange; the BIR should not impose additional requirements not provided by law, which would negate the availment of the tax exemption. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### TAX REFUNDS

Construction of 
- Cases filed before the CTA are litigated de novo; as such, party litigants should prove every minute aspect of their cases; the CTA found that respondents were able to establish their entitlement to the claimed refund; no reason to reverse the findings of the CTA; while tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer, the Government should not resort to technicalities and legalisms, much less frivolous appeals, to keep the money it is not entitled to at the expense of the taxpayers. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### TREACHERY

As an aggravating circumstance 
- Paragraph 16, Article 14 of the RPC defines treachery as the direct employment of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make; the essence of treachery is that, the attack is deliberate and without warning, and done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape; for treachery to be properly appreciated, two elements must be present: (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him; the above-mentioned elements are present in this case. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery was correctly appreciated in the killings of Suganob and Lomoljo because when they were shot while being hogtied and with plastic bags covering their hands, they had no opportunity to defend themselves and such means was deliberately adopted. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### UNLAWFUL DETAINER

Physical or material possession of the property 
- "In an unlawful detainer case, the sole issue for resolution is physical or material possession of the property involved, independent of any claim of ownership by any of the parties"; thus, "courts may pass upon the issue of ownership only for purposes of ascertaining who has the better right of possession; any ruling on ownership is merely provisional and does not bar an action between the same parties regarding title to the property." (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT)

Administrative and judicial claim for refund 
- Section 112 (A) and (C) of the NIRC, cited; periods relative to the filing of a claim for VAT refunds; preliminarily, the law allows the taxpayer to file an administrative claim for refund with the BIR within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when the purchase was made (for the input tax paid on capital goods) or after the close of the taxable quarter when the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale was made (for input tax attributable to zero-rated sale); the CIR must then act on the claim within 120 days from the submission of complete documents in support of the application; in the event of an adverse decision, the taxpayer may elevate the matter to the CTA by way of a petition for review within 30 days from the receipt of the CIR's decision; if, on the other hand, the 120-day period lapses without any action from the CIR, the taxpayer may validly treat the inaction as denial and file a petition for review before the CTA within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period; an appeal taken prior to the expiration of the 120-day period without a decision or action of the CIR is premature, without a cause of action, and, therefore, dismissible on the ground of lack of jurisdiction; Chevron filed an administrative claim for refund with the BIR on November 2, 2010, which was well within the two-year prescriptive period provided by law; upon Chevron's submission of its supporting documents, the CIR had 120 days or until March 2, 2011 to decide whether to grant or deny the application; but the 120-day period expired without the CIR having acted on the claim; at this juncture, Chevron had 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period or until April 1, 2011 to file its judicial claim; thus, when Chevron filed its petition for review with the CTA on March 23, 2011, it was properly made within the period prescribed by law. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Chevron Holdings, Inc., [Formerly Caltex (Asia) Limited], G.R. 233301, Feb. 17, 2020)

Judicial claim for refund or credit of input VAT 
- Settled is the rule that it is only upon the submission of complete documents in support of the application for tax credit/refund that the 120-day period would begin to run; Chevron submitted all documents it deemed necessary for the grant of its refund claim; as in the Pilipinas Total case, the CIR did not notify the Chevron of the document it failed to submit, if any; there is not a single letter or notice sent to Chevron informing it of its failure to submit complete documents and/or ordering the production of the lacking documents necessary for the allowance of the claim; the CIR should have taken a positive step in apprising Chevron of the completeness and adequacy of its supporting documents considering their particular relevance in reckoning the 120-day period under Section 112(C) of the NIRC. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Chevron Holdings, Inc., [Formerly Caltex (Asia) Limited], G.R. 233301, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The Court rejects the CIR's bare claim that Chevron failed to comply with the invoicing and accounting requirements for VAT-registered persons; the CIR asserts that Chevron did not imprint the word "zero-rated" on its invoices and receipts in violation of Section 113(B) of the NIRC, as amended, in relation to Revenue Regulations No. 16-05; in its original Decision, the CTA Division explicitly stated that Chevron presented various invoices, official receipts and other documents to substantiate its reported input VAT, all of which were examined by Atty. Landicho, Court-commissioned Independent Certified Public Accountant; it sustained the findings of Atty. Landicho and disallowed the P10,977,415.30 of Chevron's claimed input VAT for failure to comply with the substantiation and invoicing requirement as prescribed under Section 110(A) and Section 113(A) and (B) of the NIRC; it is thus clear that the invoices and receipts which were not compliant with the invoicing and accounting requirements were already excluded by the CTA Division when it rendered its Decision partially granting Chevron' refund claim; Chevron has duly established its claim for refund or tax credit in the amount of P4,623,001.60 in accordance with the statutory requirement for the grant of a tax credit certificate/refund. (Id.)


- The issue of whether the failure of the taxpayer to submit all the documents enumerated in RMO No. 53-98 is fatal to its claim for VAT refund had been squarely raised and amply settled in the case of Pilipinas Total Gas, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; the CIR's reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced; there is nothing in Section 12 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of refund or credit of input VAT; granting that the BIR found that the documents submitted by Total Gas were inadequate, it should have notified the latter of the inadequacy by sending it a request to produce the necessary documents in order to make a just and expeditious resolution of the claim; a taxpayer's failure with the requirements listed under RMO No. 53-98 is not fatal to its claim for tax credit or refund of excess unutilized excess VAT; RMO No. 53-98 assumes relevance only on matters pertinent to an audit of tax liabilities; no application in this case since Chevron's claim is one for refund of its input tax. (Id.)

#### VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES

Application of the Rules of Court 
- As ruled correctly by the CA, respondents' motion for reconsideration of the Panel's Decision had been timely filed; Section 3 of the VA Procedural Guidelines provides: SEC. 3. Directory and Suppletory Application of the Guidelines and Rules of the Court. – The rules governing the proceedings before a voluntary arbitrator shall be the subject of agreement among the parties to a labor dispute and their chosen arbitrator; in the absence of agreement on any or various aspects of the voluntary arbitration proceedings, the pertinent provisions of these Guidelines and the Revised Rules of Court shall apply by analogy or in a directory and suppletory character and effect; it clearly recognizes that the Rules of Court shall apply suppletorily or by analogy to arbitration proceedings; Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court had been properly appreciated in determining the timeliness of the filing of respondents' motion for reconsideration; the said section provides: SEC. 1. How to compute time.– In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included; if the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day; here, respondents have 10 days from February 5, 2015, the day they received a copy of the Panel's Decision, within which to file their motion for reconsideration; given that February 15, 2015, falls on a Sunday, respondents have until the next business day to file their motion for reconsideration. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

Motion for reconsideration 
- Petitioner contends that there is no motion for reconsideration which could have been considered as duly filed in this case that may be appealed to the CA as provided in Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court since respondents' motion for reconsideration had not been filed directly with the Panel in violation of Section 2, Rule III of the Revised Procedural Guidelines in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Proceedings (VA Procedural Guidelines); by no stretch of the imagination can Section 2, Rule III of the VA Procedural Guidelines be given a meaning as that advanced by the petitioner; "instrumentality," defined; the terms governmental "agency" or "instrumentality" are synonymous in the sense that either of them is a means by which a government acts, or by which a certain government act or function is performed; since the Panel performs a state function pursuant to a governmental power delegated to them under the Labor Code provisions, as a governmental instrumentality, the Panel holds office at the NCMB Office and the motion for reconsideration respondents filed thereat had been proper; the denial of the motion for reconsideration was not premised on the failure to directly file the motion with the Panel as the term is understood by the petitioner, but because the Panel found the motion to be lacking in merit and filed a day late. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### WITNESSES

Credibility of 
- AAA gave a clear account of her abuse; she narrated how Pueyo inflicted bodily injury upon her on November 4, 1997 in a candid manner, with seeming unpreparedness that could only impress upon a listener that her narrative was not rehearsed; the alleged inconsistencies were but trivial matters; case law holds with consistency that "when the victim's testimony is straightforward, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, unflawed by any material or significant inconsistency, it passes the test of credibility, and the accused may already be convicted solely on the basis thereof." (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Accused-appellant also argues that even AAA's testimony is not credible for being riddled with inconsistencies as to where the second incident occurred, whether penetration took place, his reaction when she refused to massage him, and whether AAA indeed feared him; the argument must fail; the inconsistencies pointed out by accused-appellant refer to minor details only, which do not touch upon the central fact of the crime and do not impair AAA's credibility; if at all, they serve as proof that AAA was not coached or rehearsed. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Accused-appellant also assails AAA's credibility on her testimony that he attempted to kill her; he claims that it was dubious how AAA sustained no physical injuries if he really did attack her with a bladed weapon; these matters, however, are irrelevant to the crime charged and do not deserve consideration; People v. Nelmida teaches that "an inconsistency, which has nothing to do with the elements of a crime, is not a ground to reverse a conviction"; the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the Office of the Solicitor General's argument that it was not impossible to escape such an attack unscathed if AAA had successfully parried the bladed weapon. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Evidence to be given credence must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances; the issue of credibility, when it is decisive of the guilt or innocence of the accused, is determined by the conformity of the conflicting claims and recollections of the witnesses to common experience and to the observation of mankind as probable under the circumstances; there is no test to the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation, and experience; whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In assessing AAA's credibility, the Court of Appeals held that "it is against human nature for a young girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself as well as her family to a lifetime of shame" 
- effectively reiterating an outdated standard for assessing witness credibility; this Court's discussion in People v. Amarela is more timely and appropriate for this case: More often than not, where the alleged victim survives to tell her story of sexual depredation, rape cases are solely decided based on the credibility of the testimony of the private complainant; in doing so, we have hinged on the impression that no young Filipina of decent repute would publicly admit that she has been sexually abused, unless that is the truth, for it is her natural instinct to protect her honor; however, this misconception, particularly in this day and age, not only puts the accused at un unfair disadvantage, but created a travesty of justice; this opinion borders on the fallacy of non sequitur; and while the factual setting back then would have been appropriate to say it is natural for a woman to be reluctant in disclosing a sexual assault; today, we simply cannot be stuck to the Maria Clara stereotype of a demure and reserved Filipino woman; We, should stay away from such mindset and accept the realities of a woman's dynamic role in society today: she who has over the years transformed into a strong and confidently intelligent and beautiful person, willing to fight for her rights; in this way, we can evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception; in order for us to affirm a conviction for rape, we must believe beyond reasonable doubt the version of events narrated by the victim; thus, in Amarela, the accused was acquitted because the victim's account was improbable and married by inconsistencies, regardless of the existing preconception that a Filipino woman's honor would prevent her from lying about her ordeal. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)


- It has been held that when the issue involves matters like credibility of witnesses, the calibration of their testimonies as well as the assessment of the probative weight thereof, findings of the trial court and its conclusions anchored on said findings are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect; there being no showing that the RTC misconstrued or misapprehended any relevant fact in this case, the Court gives full respect to its findings and conclusion, which were sustained on appeal by the CA, supporting accused-appellant's conviction for Murder. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Neither can the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities taint her trustworthiness; a rape charge becomes doubtful only when the delay in revealing its commission is unreasonable and unexplained; AAA did not immediately report the incidents to her mother considering the moral ascendancy and influence exerted upon her by accused-appellant, whom she relied on for support of her educational needs, as well as accused-appellant's threats of bodily harm against her and her family. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- On Marietta's supposed failure to lend succor to her father who was being attacked, suffice it to state that there could be no hard and fast gauge for measuring a person's reaction or behavior when confronted with a startling, not to mention horrifying, occurrence; witnesses of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their situation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience; the workings of the human mind placed under emotional stress are unpredictable, and people react differently to shocking stimulus 
- some may shout, some may faint, and others may be plunged into insensibility. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The failure of the victims to shout for help or escape during the incident does not impair their credibility; it is not also fatal to the prosecution's case; no standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult; people react differently to emotional stress, and rape victims are no different from them; AAA was only a 13-year-old minor at the time of the incidents; given her tender age, her failure to immediately flee from accused-appellant, by itself, cannot taint her credibility as a rape victim. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal; however, this is not a hard and fast rule; the Court has reviewed the trial court's factual findings when there is a showing that the trial judge overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the case; here, circumstances exist that raise serious doubts on accused-appellants' culpability of the crime charged. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- We affirm the factual findings and the evaluation of AAA's credibility and testimony in the absence of showing that the lower courts may have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance; when a woman, especially a minor, alleges rape, she says in effect all that is necessary to mean that she has been raped; further, youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity; a young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere fabrication. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- When the credibility of the eyewitness is at issue, due deference and respect shall be given to the trial court's factual findings, its calibration of the testimonies, its assessment of their probative weight, and its conclusions based on such factual findings, absent any showing that it had overlooked circumstances that would have affected the final outcome of the case; this rule finds an even more stringent application where the trial court's findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al. vs. Pigar @ "Biroy," G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- While accused-appellant attempts to cast doubt on the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, the settled rule is that the trial court's determination of witness credibility will not be disturbed on appeal unless significant matters have been overlooked; such determination is treated with respect, as the trial court has the opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor during trial; its findings assume ever greater weight when they are affirmed by the Court of Appeals; the Regional Trial Court found AAA's testimony credible and sufficiently corroborated; her straightforward and positive testimony that her grandfather raped her, Barangay Captain Lotec's testimony stating that she was "pale and trembling," the medical certificate indicating lacerations to her hymen, and accused-appellant's own admission of the paternal relationship between him and the victim were collectively deemed sufficient for conviction; these findings were then affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which found AAA to be unwavering in "the material points of her testimony"; the lower courts' findings on AAA's credibility should be upheld, more so in view of accused-appellant's failure to raise any cogent reason for reversal. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)

Discrepancies or inconsistencies between affidavit and testimony 
- The claimed discrepancies refer to trivial matters which neither negate nor disprove the commission of the alleged offenses; accused-appellant himself admitted that his store is merely 15 meters away from AAA's house; the distance between accused-appellant's house and AAA's house, as well as his store and AAA's house, was not of such nature as to render it impossible for him to commit the subject offenses; there is no discrepancy as to the exact number of instances accused-appellant raped AAA since the latter candidly admitted in her testimony the fact that she could not remember the precise number of times she was molested but it always happened on a Saturday; discrepancies or inconsistencies between a witness' affidavit and testimony do not necessarily impair the latter's credibility as affidavits are taken ex parte and are often incomplete or inaccurate for lack or absence of searching inquiries by the investigating officer; in the event of any inconsistency between a witness' affidavit and testimony in court, as in this case, the latter shall prevail. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

State witness 
- As to the discharge of an accused as state witness, the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that: (1) there is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused whose discharge is requested; (2) there is no other direct evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of said accused; (3) the testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated in its material points; (4) said accused does not appear to be the most guilty; and (5) said accused has not at any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

Testimony of 
- Credence is accorded to the testimony of Ernie, who positively identified accused-appellant as the one who stabbed his father; the alleged inconsistency between Ernie's affidavit and his testimony in open court does not affect his credibility as it does not detract from the fact that he saw and identified accused-appellant as the assailant of his father; a sworn statement or an affidavit does not purport to contain a complete compendium of the details of the event narrated by the affiant; sworn statements taken ex parte are generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### ABUSE OF RIGHTS

Bad faith 
- While it has submitted voluminous documents to show that its actions were justified by the terms of the Distributorship Agreement, PELI has not had the opportunity to prove that the foregoing acts mentioned in the Complaint were indeed made without malice and bad faith, since it was not even able to file an answer to Tocoms' complaint; the legal concept of bad faith denotes a dishonest purpose, moral deviation, and a conscious commission of a wrong; it includes "a breach of known duty through some motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud; it is, therefore, a question of intention, which can be inferred from one's conduct and/or contemporaneous x x x statements"; bad faith under the law cannot be presumed; it must be established by clear and convincing evidence; as such, the case must be reinstated so that PELI may once and for all prove its bona fides in its dealings with Tocoms, in connection with the expiration of their Distribution Agreement. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

Elements 
- Most recently in Chevron Philippines, Inc. v. Mendoza, this Court has held that abuse of rights under Article 19 has three elements, namely: (1) the existence of a legal right or duty, (2) an exercise of such right or discharge of such duty in bad faith, and (3) such exercise of right or discharge of duty was made with the sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another; however, the Court has also held that: There is no hard and fast rule which can be applied to determine whether or not the principle of abuse of rights may be invoked; the question of whether or not the principle of abuse of rights has been violated, resulting in damages under Articles 20 and 21 or other applicable provision of law, depends on the circumstances of each case; cases such as University of the East v. Jader and the Globe Mackay case, where the Court did not utilize the foregoing threefold test in finding a violation of Article 19, have therefore led to the following observation, viz.: The principle of abuse of rights may be invoked if it is proven that a right or duty was exercised in bad faith, regardless of whether it was for the sole intent of injuring another; it is the absence of good faith which is essential for the application of this principle; the foregoing discussion highlights bad faith as the crucial element to a violation of Article 19; the mala fide exercise of a legal right in accordance with Article 19 is penalized by Article 21, under which "any person who wilfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the damage"; Article 19 imposes upon all persons exercising their legal rights the duty to act with justice, give everyone his due, and to observe honesty and good faith; failure to discharge such duties is compensable under Article 20 if the act is "contrary to law"; and under Article 21 if the act is legal but "contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy." (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

Nature and purpose 
- The nature and purpose of Article 19 of the Civil Code was discussed in Globe Mackay Radio and Cable Corp. v. CA, viz.: This article, known to contain what is commonly referred to as the principle of abuse of rights, sets certain standards which must be observed not only in the exercise of one's rights but also in the performance of one's duties; these standards are the following: to act with justice; to give everyone his due; and to observe honesty and good faith; the law, therefore, recognizes a primordial limitation on all rights; that in their exercise, the norms of human conduct set forth in Article 19 must be observed; a right, though by itself legal because recognized or granted by law as such, may nevertheless become the source of some illegality; when a light is exercised in a manner which does not conform with the norms enshrined in Article 19 and results in damage to another, a legal wrong is thereby committed for which the wrongdoer must be held responsible; while Article 19 lays down a rule of conduct for the government of human relations and for the maintenance of social order, it does not provide a remedy for its violation; generally, an action for damages under either Article 20 or Article 21 would be proper. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### ABUSE OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH

As a qualifying circumstance 
- Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is a notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor selected or taken advantage of by him in the commission of the crime; the inequality of forces in this case is beyond doubt; Feliciano, Sr. was a thin 52-year-old man who was slow moving according to his daughter; appellants attacked him with nine (9) persons; the number alone shows the inequality of strength between the victim and the aggressors; coupled with the fact that Feliciano, Sr. was already a frail man, supports the finding of abuse of superior strength; this circumstance qualifies the killing of Feliciano, Sr. into murder. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Abuse of superior strength was also present in the case for the killing of the three victims as there was a notorious inequality of forces between the accused-appellants as police officers and the three who were already weak from the beatings they had endured. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

- A dismissal of an action for failure to prosecute operates as a judgment on the merits; expressly provided under Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, as amended; while the Court agrees with petitioners that the dismissal order had the effect of adjudication on the merits, our acquiescence ends there; dismissal with prejudice means that there is an adjudication on the merits as well as a final disposition, barring the right to bring or maintain an action on the same claim or cause; an "adjudication on the merits" for non prosequitor cases imposes as a sanction "prejudice to the refiling of the same claim"; an involuntary dismissal generally acts as a judgment on the merits for the purposes of res judicata. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### ACTIONS, PRESCRIPTION OF

Filing of complaint for illegal dismissal 
- As to the issue on prescription, Gallego timely filed his complaint; repatriated in August 2000, he was repeatedly instructed to wait for the results of the training of the newly recruited crew members of the vessel, M/V Eastern Falcon, he previously boarded, and was likewise promised for re-deployment; Gallego patiently waited for three years or until February 2003; it cannot be said that his cause of action accrued from the time he was repatriated in August 2000 because he was thereafter promised re-deployment; besides, he was illegally dismissed; the prescriptive period to file a complaint for illegal dismissal is four years from the time the cause of action accrued; an action for illegal dismissal or when one is arbitrarily and unjustly deprived of his job or means of livelihood is essentially a complaint for "injury to rights," which falls under Article 1146 of the Civil Code of the Philippines; his filing of the labor complaint is within the four-year prescriptive period from the time the cause of action accrued. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### ALIBI

Defense of 
- For the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove not only that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity; the excuse must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception; where there is the least possibility of accused-appellant's presence at the crime scene, as in this case, the alibi will not hold water; here, "Lawlaw" claims to have been working in the bakery at the time of the incident; aside from being an unsubstantiated claim, it was not shown that it was physically impossible for "Lawlaw" to be at the situs criminis; the alleged bakery is also located at the same barangay where Feliciano, Sr.'s house is located. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT OF 2004 (R.A. 9285) VIS-A-VIS PROHIBITION ON ISSUANCE OF INJUNCTION IN CASES INVOLVING NATIONAL GOVERNMENT PROJECTS (R.A. 8975)

Interim or provisional relief 
- Petitioner adds that there is an extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue making the prohibition under RA 8975 inapplicable; petitioner invokes the third paragraph of Section 3 of RA 8975, but We do not agree; the issue between the parties are purely contractual; in Falcon, it was sharply ruled that, and as applicable herein: In the instant case, the State action being assailed is the DFA's termination of the Amended BOT Agreement with BCA; although the said agreement involves a public service that the DFA is mandated to provide and, therefore, is imbued with public interest, the relationship of DFA to BCA is primarily contractual and their dispute involves the adjudication of contractual rights; the propriety of the DFA's acts, in relation to the termination of the Amended BOT Agreement, should be gauged against the provisions of the contract itself and the applicable statutes to such contract; these contractual and statutory provisions outline what constitutes due process in the present case; BCA failed to demonstrate that there is a constitutional issue involved in this case, much less a constitutional issue of extreme urgency. (Busan Universal Rail, Inc. vs. Department of Transportation – Metro Rail Transit 3, G.R. 235878, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The parties actually agree that the dispute between them arising from the MRT3 Contract should be referred to arbitration; the MRT3 Contract was entered into as a result of a negotiated procurement under R.A. 9184, or the Government Procurement Reform Act; under Section 28 of R.A. 9285 or the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004, as referred to in Section 59, Rule XVIII of the Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9184, the grant of an interim measure of protection by the proper court before the constitution of an arbitral tribunal is allowed; however, R.A. 8975 prohibits the issuance of temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions against national government project; on the application of RA 9285 vis-à-vis RA 8975, the case of Falcon is instructive: Republic Act No. 9285 is a general law applicable to all matters and controversies to be resolved through alternative dispute resolution methods; this law allows a Regional Trial Court to grant interim or provisional relief, including preliminary injunction, to parties in an arbitration case prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal; this general statute, however, must give way to a special law governing national government projects, R.A. 8975 which prohibits courts, except the Supreme Court, from issuing TROs and writs of preliminary injunction in cases involving national government projects; a court's grant of injunctive relief in such an instance is prejudicial to public interest since government would be indefinitely hampered in its duty to provide vital public goods and services in order to preserve the private propriety rights of the project proponent; the only circumstance under which a court may grant injunctive relief is the existence of a matter of extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, such that unless a TRO or injunctive writ is issued, grave injustice and irreparable injury will result; inasmuch as petitioner was seeking to restrain respondent from terminating the MRT3 Contract, the cited pronouncements in Falcon find application; the RTC properly dismissed petitioner's petition. (Busan Universal Rail, Inc. vs. Department of Transportation – Metro Rail Transit 3, G.R. 235878, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### AN ACT TO ENSURE THE EXPEDITIOUS IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS BY PROHIBITING LOWER COURTS FROM ISSUING TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS, PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS OR PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTIONS, PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF, AND OTHER PURPOSES (R.A. 8975)

Issuance of temporary restraining orders and writs of preliminary injunction 
- Section 3 of R.A. 8975 expressly vests jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court to issue any TRO, preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction against the government, or any of its subdivisions, officials or any person or entity, whether public or private acting under the government's direction, to restrain, prohibit or compel specified acts; in Philco Aero, Inc. v. Secretary Tugade, this Court recognized the remedy of resorting directly before this Court in cases covered under R.A. 8975; Section 3 thereof was explicit in excluding other courts in the issuance of injunctive writs; however, in Bases Conversion and Development Authority v. Uy, this Court clarified that the prohibition applies only to TRO and preliminary injunction, viz.: A perusal of these aforequoted provisions readily reveals that all courts, except this Court, are proscribed from issuing TROs and writs of preliminary injunction against the implementation or execution of specified government projects; thus, the ambit of the prohibition covers only temporary or preliminary restraining orders or writs but NOT decisions on the merits granting permanent injunctions; considering that these laws trench on judicial power, they should be strictly construed; therefore, while courts below this Court are prohibited by these laws from issuing temporary or preliminary restraining orders pending the adjudication of the case, said statutes however do not explicitly proscribe the issuance of a permanent injunction granted by a court of law arising from an adjudication of a case on the merits. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### ANTI-GRAFT AND CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (R.A. 3019)

Elements 
- In PCGG v. Office of the Ombudsman, the Court reiterated the well-settled elements of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 as follows: (i) that the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial, or official functions, or a private individual acting in conspiracy with such public officers; (ii) that he acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence; and (iii) that his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or giving any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference in the discharge of his functions. (Canlas vs. People, et al., G.R. Nos. 236308-09, Feb. 17, 2020)

Section 3(e) 
- The well-settled rule is that "private persons, when acting in conspiracy with public officers, may be indicted and, if found guilty, held liable for the pertinent offenses under Section 3 of R.A. 3019, in consonance with the avowed policy of the anti-graft law to repress certain acts of public officers and private persons alike constituting graft or corrupt practices act or which may lead thereto"; the Court, in various cases, had the occasion to affirm the indictment and/or conviction of a private individual, acting in conspiracy with public officers, for violation of Section 3 of R.A. 3019 particularly paragraph (e) thereof. (Canlas vs. People, et al., G.R. Nos. 236308-09, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ANTI-SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACT (R.A. 7877)

Liability of employer 
- The distinction between the employer and an erring managerial officer is likewise present in sexual harassment cases; under Section 5 of the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act, the employer is only solidarity liable for damages with the perpetrator in case an act of sexual harassment was reported and it did not take immediate action on the matter; this provision thus illustrates that the employer must first be informed of the acts of the erring managerial officer before it can be held liable for the latter's acts; conversely, if the employer has been informed of the acts of its managerial staff, and does not contest or question it, it is deemed to have authorized or be complicit to the acts of its erring employee; Batucan cannot be considered to have been acting on petitioner's behalf when he sexually harassed respondent; thus, respondent cannot base her illegal dismissal complaint against petitioner solely on Batucan's acts; however, even if petitioner had no participation in the sexual harassment, it had been informed of the incident; despite this, it failed to take immediate action on respondent's complaint; its lack of prompt action reinforced the hostile work environment created by Batucan. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

Workplace sexual harassment 
- Workplace sexual harassment occurs when a supervisor, or agent of an employer, or any other person who has authority over another in a work environment, imposes sexual favors on another, which creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the latter; "the gravamen of the offense in sexual harassment is not the violation of the employee's sexuality but the abuse of power by the employer." (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### APPEAL IN CRIMINAL CASES

Appeal by any of several accused 
- Fulgado must be and is so acquitted for failure of the prosecution to justify the arresting officers' non-compliance with the three-witness rule under Section 21 of R.A. 9165; Tamayo, Fulgado's co-accused in this case, must perforce be acquitted as well considering that (1) under Section 11 (a), Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, a favorable judgment shall benefit the co-accused who did not appeal; and (2) the evidence against and the conviction of Tamayo and Fulgado are inextricably linked; hence, the acquittal of Fulgado based on reasonable doubt should likewise apply to her co-accused Tamayo albeit no appeal was filed by the latter. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)

Civil liability 
- It is settled that in criminal cases, the State is the offended party and the private complainant's interest is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom; hence, if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, a reconsideration of the order of dismissal or acquittal may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, insofar as the criminal aspect thereof is concerned and may be made only by the public prosecutor; or in the case of an appeal, by the State only, through the Office of the Solicitor General; the private complainant or offended party may not undertake such motion for reconsideration or appeal on the criminal aspect of the case; however, the offended party or private complainant may file a motion for reconsideration of such dismissal or acquittal or appeal therefrom but only insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned; the rationale behind this rule is that in a criminal case, the party affected by the dismissal of the criminal action is the State and not the private complainant; the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited only to the civil liability; in the prosecution of the offense, the complainant's role is limited to that of a witness for the prosecution such that when a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal therefrom on the criminal aspect may be undertaken only by the State through the Solicitor General; the private offended party or complainant may not take such appeal, but may only do so as to the civil aspect of the case. (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)

Concept 
- In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors; the appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The Court has definitively ruled that in a criminal case in which the offended party is the State, the interest of the private complainant or the private offended party is limited to the civil liability arising therefrom; if a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, an appeal of the criminal aspect may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, only by the State through the Solicitor General; as a rule, only the Solicitor General may represent the People of the Philippines on appeal; the private offended party or complainant may not undertake such appeal; in its petition for certiorari filed with the RTC, petitioner seeks the annulment of the MTC decision acquitting herein respondents; in so doing, petitioner raises issues on the admissibility of evidence which it submitted to prove the guilt of the accused; these issues necessarily require a review of the criminal aspect of the case and, as such, is prohibited; only the State, and not herein petitioner, who is the private offended party, may question the criminal aspect of the case. (Id.)

#### APPEALS

Appeal bond 
- This procedural rule may be relaxed in the interest of substantial justice; first, the case was already in its execution stage; BATELEC II had already posted an appeal bond when it appealed the case for the first time on its merit; the purpose of an appeal bond, which is to ensure, during the period of appeal, against any occurrence that would defeat or diminish recovery by the aggrieved employees under the judgment if subsequently affirmed, has in fact been satisfied; the winning party was already secured of payment by the losing party, or in default thereof, by the surety company; second, at the time when an appeal was made from the March 22, 2002 NLRC Resolution, the final award, upon which the bond should be based, has not yet been settled; in the fairly recent case of Sara Lee Philippines, Inc. v. Macatlang, the Court decreed that the NLRC may dispense with the posting of the bond when the judgment award is: (1) not stated or (2) based on a patently erroneous computation. (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Appeal in labor cases 
- "As a general rule, a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court covers only questions of law; questions of fact are not reviewable and cannot be passed upon by the Court in the exercise of its power to review under Rule 45"; nevertheless, this rule admits of certain exceptions, such as: 1. when the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; 2. when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3. when there is grave abuse of discretion; 4. when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5. when the findings of fact are conflicting; 6. when in making its findings, the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; 7. when the findings are contrary to that of the trial court; 8. when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; 9. when the facts set forth in the petition, as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs, are not disputed by the respondent; 10. when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and 11. when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion; the present case falls under one of the exceptions. (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In labor cases, a Rule 45 petition is limited to reviewing whether the CA correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and deciding other jurisdictional errors of the NLRC; the CA correctly found grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC when it affirmed the ruling of the LA and upheld the medical assessment issued by Solacito's personal physician over the one issued by the company-designated physicians; however, the CA erred in independently giving a disability rating to Solacito and awarding partial and permanent disability benefits. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court may review factual issues in a labor case when the factual findings are in conflict; although as a rule this Court may only review questions of law, however, in exceptional cases, it may review the facts in labor cases where the findings of the CA and of the labor tribunals are contradictory, which is the case herein. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452. Feb. 12, 2020)


- We do not subscribe to the NLRC's interpretation of the rule on appeal bond, specifically that which dispenses with the requirement of an appeal bond if "the order appealed from is not an original decision of the Labor Arbiter affecting the whole spectrum of the instant case"; in Toyota Alabang, Inc. v. Games, this Court was emphatic in declaring that Article 223 of the Labor Code and Section 6, Rule VI of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure "do not limit the appeal bond requirement only to certain kinds of rulings of the Labor Arbiter; rather, these rules generally state that in case the ruling of the Labor Arbiter involves a monetary award, an employer's appeal may be perfected only upon the posting of a bond; absent any qualifying terms, so long as the decision of the Labor Arbiter involves a monetary award, as in this case, that ruling can only be appealed after the employer posts a bond." (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Appeal to the Court of Appeals 
- In an appeal to the CA, whether under Rule 42 of the Rules of Court, or via certiorari under Rule 45 of the same rules, the mode depends primarily on the Decision or Order being appealed from; if it is a final judgment, then the appeal must be filed within 15 days from receipt of the same; or if it is an appeal against an interlocutory order, a petition for certiorari may be resorted to under the ultimate paragraph of Section 1, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, by virtue of which the aggrieved party may institute an appropriate special civil action under Rule 65; it was error for petitioner to treat the dismissal as an interlocutory order, because it was in fact a final judgment. (Domingo vs. Macapagal, G.R. 242577, Feb. 26, 2020)

Factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial agencies 
- Considering that the findings of the DAR-Region VIII, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator, and the DARAB Central Office are similar in all material respects, these should not be disturbed, more so in this case where the CA sustained such findings; "the factual findings of administrative agencies and officials that have acquired expertise in the performance of their official duties and in the exercise of their primary jurisdiction are generally accorded not only respect but, at times, even finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence"; such factual findings, especially when affirmed by the CA, are binding on the Court. (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In petitions for review on certiorari, only questions of law may be raised by the parties and passed upon by the Court; as a general rule, factual findings of administrative agencies, such as the CSC, that are affirmed by the CA, are conclusive upon and generally not reviewable by the Court, unless these findings are not supported by substantial evidence. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The rule is that the factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies such as the NLRC are generally accorded not only respect, but at times, even finality because of the special knowledge and expertise they have gained from handling matters falling under their specialized jurisdiction; similarly, factual findings of the CA are generally not subject to the Court's review in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; the Court is not a trier of facts, and this rule applies with greater force in labor cases; the Court is not swayed by petitioners' claim that their statements were done with good intention and justifiable motives; neither is the Court moved by petitioners' assertion that the CA erred in not giving weight to the sworn statement of their witness, to the effect that they did not utter the alleged libelous statements being attributed to them; these matters are outside this Court's authority to act; only questions of law are entertained in a Rule 45 petition; as held in Madridejos v. NYK-FIL Ship Management, Inc., the Court does not re-examine conflicting evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of the NLRC, an administrative body that has expertise in its specialized field; the Court does not replace its own judgment for that of the tribunal in determining where the weight of evidence lies or what evidence is credible. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Factual findings of the Court of Appeals 
- Petitions for review under Rule 45 are limited to questions of law; thus, factual findings of the CA, when supported by substantial evidence, are binding upon this Court, for the simple reason that the CA is still a trial court, while this Court is not a trier of facts; however, such rule does not apply when the findings of the appellate court conflict with those of the trial court. (Dalida vs. Concepcion Bohol-Zenoni, G.R. 214649, Feb. 26, 2020)

Factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals 
- Time and again, great weight and highest respect are accorded to the factual findings of the CTA; the Court will not review nor disturb the CTA's factual determination when it is supported by substantial evidence and there is no showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the CTA, as in this case. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Chevron Holdings, Inc. [Formerly Caltex (Asia) Limited], G.R. 233301, Feb. 17, 2020)

Factual findings of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) 
- It is well settled in labor cases that the factual findings of the NLRC are accorded respect and even finality by the Court when they coincide with those of the LA and are supported by substantial evidence; here, the CA affirmed the findings of fact of the LA and the NLRC with respect to the dismissal from service of petitioners for just causes; the CA noted that both the LA and the NLRC found petitioners to have uttered libelous statements against respondent SPC and held that such act constitutes serious misconduct, which is a ground for the termination of their employment. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Factual findings of the trial court 
- Ordinarily, the Court refrains from disturbing the factual findings and conclusions of the RTC, especially when affirmed by the CA; however, the Court will not hesitate to do so where the lower courts overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, would affect the outcome of the case – as here. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The courts below held Arriola criminally liable for Estafa by false deceits under Article 315, Paragraph 2(a) of the RPC; ordinarily, this Court desists from trifling with the findings of facts by the courts below; findings by trial courts are generally accorded with great respect by the appellate courts, more so that the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts but of questions of law; for this case, however, We defer to one of the prevailing exceptions listed by jurisprudence, that is, when the findings of fact by the trial court were conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; the courts below correctly convicted Arriola, but not much substantial discussion was made on the falsity of his representations and the documentary evidence thereof. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 
- By filing a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court to assail the CA Decision dated December 12, 2016 and Resolution dated May 25, 2017, petitioner availed herself of the wrong remedy; the proper remedy to question a CA's judgment, final order or resolution, as in the instant case, is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the same Rules; under Supreme Court Circular 2-90, an appeal taken to this Court or to the CA by a wrong or an inappropriate mode warrants its outright dismissal; the Court reminds petitioner, as it has consistently reminded countless other litigants, that the invocation of substantial justice is not a magic potion that automatically compels the Court to set aside technical rules; a petition for certiorari under Rule 45 must be filed within 15 days from notice of the judgment, final order or resolution appealed from; or of the denial of petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment; petitioner received the CA Resolution denying her motion for reconsideration on June 19, 2017 and filed the instant petition 46 days later or on August 4, 2017, by which time she had already lost her appeal under Rule 45. (Fernandez vs. Court of Appeals, Twenty-Third Division, Cagayan de Oro City, et al., G.R. 233460, Feb. 19, 2020)


- It is a settled rule that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; this Court is not a trier of facts; hence, it will not entertain questions of facts as it is bound by the findings of fact made by the CA when supported by substantial evidence; there are, however, exceptions to the rule wherein the Court may pass upon and review the findings of fact by the CA; instances enumerated in Medina v. Asistio, Jr., to wit: (1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on record; the instant case falls under the exceptions. (Social Security System vs. Seno, Jr., et al., G.R. 183478, Feb. 10, 2020)


- Rule 45, Section 1 of the Rules of Court authorizes direct resort from the Regional Trial Courts to this Court on pure questions of law; in Uy v. Chua, this Court gave due course to a Petition for Review against a Resolution of the RTC on the issue of res judicata; the present petition does not raise any factual question; the petition poses a sole question: Which tribunal has jurisdiction over the suit for damages filed by the spouses Ang? This question does not involve any determination or finding of truth or falsehood of the factual allegations raised by the spouses Ang; but instead concerns the applicability of the construction arbitration laws to the suit filed by the spouses; direct resort to this Court is therefore justified. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)


- The other issues raised by petitioner Spouses are clearly factual in nature; these issues cannot be entertained in a Rule 45 petition wherein the Court's jurisdiction is limited to reviewing and revising errors of law that might have been committed by the lower courts; the Petition should be denied in the absence of any exceptional circumstance as to merit the Court's review of factual questions that have already been settled by the tribunals below. (Spouses Garcia, doing business under the name and style of Ecolamp Multi-Resources vs. Northern Islands, Co., Inc., G.R. 226495, Feb. 5, 2020)

Petition for review under Rule 43 
- In not a few instances, the Court has variably applied the 10-day period provided in Article 276 of the Labor Code and the 15-day period in Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court in determining the proper period of appeal from a decision or award rendered by a Voluntary Arbitrator or a Panel thereof to the CA; Guagua National Colleges v. Court of Appeals, cited; in this case, the Court ruled that the 10-day period stated in Article 276 of the Labor Code should be understood as the period within which the party adversely affected by the ruling of the Voluntary Arbitrator or the Panel may file a motion for reconsideration; this is in line with the pronouncement in Teng v. Pahagac where the Court had clarified that the 10-day period set in Article 276 of the Labor Code gave the aggrieved parties the opportunity to file their motion for reconsideration; in Guagua, once the motion for reconsideration interposed had been resolved, the aggrieved party may now opt to appeal to the CA by way of a petition for review under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court; pursuant to Section 4 of the said Rule, the aggrieved party has 15 days to file the same; respondents' appeal had clearly been filed within the reglementary period provided in Rule 43. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

Points of law, issues, theories, and arguments 
- A motion to dismiss which has been granted on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter operates as a dismissal without prejudice; such order is not subject to an appeal under Section 1 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court; the remedy of the aggrieved party is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65; here, not only did petitioners avail of the wrong remedy by filing an appeal by certiorari under Rule 45, but they likewise violated the doctrine of hierarchy of courts in assailing the twin Resolutions of the RTC, directly before us. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)


- It is hornbook law that issues and arguments not presented before the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; an issue that was neither averred in the complaint nor raised during the trial cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, for to do so would be offensive to the basic rules of fair play, justice, and due process. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- The Court finds no merit in respondents' argument that the present petition should be dismissed for failure to implead the CA as a public respondent; what petitioner filed is a petition for review on certiorari; unlike in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, wherein the public respondent is included as a nominal party, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court does not require the public respondent to be impleaded. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The Municipality of Cainta directly filed this petition; the established policy is to strictly observe the judicial hierarchy of courts; however, Section 2(c), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court allows a party to question the decision of the RTC directly to this Court on pure questions of law; a question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for the examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsity of facts being admitted; a question of fact exists when the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence. (Municipality of Cainta, Rizal vs. Spouses Braña, et al., G.R. 199290, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The Notice of Appeal filed by Fulgado in accordance with Rule 122, Section 3(e), in relation to Rule 124, Section 13(c) of the Rules of Court opens the entire case for review by the Court on any question be it one of fact or law, or mixed, and even one not raised by the parties. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Whether a deed of absolute sale is genuine is a question of fact not proper in a petition for review on certiorari, as only questions of law may be raised in a petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; moreover, the trial court's factual findings, especially when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are generally conclusive upon this Court. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

Questions of fact 
- Petitioners resurfaced its arguments on the legality of Dela Cruz's dismissal, and surrendered the issue on the timeliness of Dela Cruz's appeal; the Court is thus called to resolve the issues of whether Dela Cruz was terminated or suspended; whether, in either case, the substantive and procedural requirements were met; and whether Dela Cruz abandoned her employment; these issues are factual in nature and should have been raised by the petitioners in their motion for reconsideration from the NLRC's Decision dated June 28, 2013, and should have been pleaded by petitioners before the CA if only to aid the appellate court in determining the paramount issue of whether the NLRC acted capriciously or despotically; the Court generally does not entertain questions of fact in a petition for review on certiorari; because the rulings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC are conflicting, and, to write an end to the controversy, we deem it of sound judicial economy to proceed with the issue as regards the legality of Dela Cruz's dismissal. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The prosecution's evidence is sufficient to uphold the findings of fact against petitioner; questions of fact may no longer be raised in Rule 45 petitions; here, the Municipal Trial Court, the Regional Trial Court, and the Court of Appeals all consistently found that petitioner slapped and kicked P02 Navarro while he was on official duty as a police officer; the lower courts arrived at this conclusion after thoroughly examining both parties' evidence; this Court will no longer disturb their uniform findings. (Mallari vs. People, G.R. 224679, Feb. 12, 2020)

Questions of fact and question of law 
- Questions of fact raised in this petition are not proper under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain set of facts, while a question of fact arises when there is doubt as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts; for a question to be one of law, it must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants; the resolution of the issue must rest solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts and circumstances; once it is clear that the issue invites a review of the evidence presented, the question is one of fact; Thus, the test of whether a question is one of law or of fact is not the appellation given to such question by the party raising the same; rather, it is whether the appellate court can determine the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact. (Republic vs. Castillo, et al., G.R. 190453, Feb. 26, 2020)

Questions of law 
- It is recognized under Rule 45 that an appeal from the trial court's decision may be undertaken through a petition for review on certiorari directly filed with the Court where only questions of law are raised or involved; a question of law arises when there is doubt as to what the law is on a certain state of facts, while there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to the truth or falsity of the alleged facts; for a question to be one of law, its resolution must not involve an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants, but must rely solely on what the law provides on the given set of facts; if the facts are disputed or if the issues require an examination of the evidence, the question posed is one of fact; the test, therefore, is not the appellation given to a question by the party raising it, but whether the appellate court can resolve the issue without examining or evaluating the evidence, in which case, it is a question of law; otherwise, it is a question of fact; an examination of the present petition shows petitioner essentially challenging the dismissal of the case based solely on the premise that a ruling on ownership in an ejectment case is merely ancillary to resolve the issue of possession and should not bind the title or ownership of the land; this is clearly a question of law which calls for an examination and interpretation of the prevailing law and jurisprudence. (Tiña vs. Sta. Clara Estate, Inc., G.R. 239979, Feb. 17, 2020)

Service of the appeal 
- Pursuant to Section 5, Rule 56 of the Rules of Court, aside from petitioners' duty to supply this Court with the correct address of respondents as proof of service of the appeal, it is beholden upon them to comply with all directives or orders from the Court within a reasonable period; for petitioners' failure to comply with the Court's directives without justifiable cause, the present petition should be dismissed motu proprio; petitioners' inaction had already caused the arbitrary dragging of this petition for review on certiorari which had been pending since February 23, 2013 and to await for the parties' compliance would again put in jeopardy the timely resolution of this appeal. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### ARBITRARY DETENTION

Elements 
- Arbitrary Detention is committed by any public officer or employee who, without legal grounds, detains a person; the elements of the crime are: (1) the offender is a public officer or employee; (2) he detains a person; and (3) the detention is without legal grounds. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ATTEMPTED FELONY

Elements 
- The essential elements of an attempted felony are as follows: (1) the offender commences the commission of the felony directly by overt acts; (2) he does not perform all the acts of execution which should produce the felony; (3) the offender's act be not stopped by his own spontaneous desistance; and (4) the non-performance of all acts of execution was due to cause or accident other than his spontaneous desistance. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ATTEMPTED OR FRUSTRATED MURDER

Elements 
- With respect to attempted or frustrated murder, the principal and essential element thereof is the intent on the part of the assailant to take the life of the person attacked; such intent must be proved in a clear and evident manner to exclude every possible doubt as to the homicidal intent of the aggressor; intent to kill is a specific intent that the State must allege in the information, and then prove by either direct or circumstantial evidence, as differentiated from a general criminal intent, which is presumed from the commission of a felony by dolo; intent to kill, being a state of mind, is discerned by the courts only through external manifestations, i.e., the acts and conduct of the accused at the time of the assault and immediately thereafter; the following factors are considered, namely: (1) the means used by the malefactors; (2) the nature, location, and number of wounds sustained by the victim; (3) the conduct of the malefactors before, during, or immediately after the killing of the victim; and (4) the circumstances under which the crime was committed and the motives of the accused. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### ATTEMPTED THEFT

Elements 
- Even if the seized ink cartridges were admitted in evidence, the Court agrees with the OSG that the probative value of these pieces of evidence must still meet the various tests by which their reliability is to be determined; their tendency to convince and persuade must be considered separately because admissibility of evidence is different from its probative value; as contended by the OSG, "even granting arguendo that the MTC indeed committed an error in ruling that there was illegal search and seizure in this case, the prosecution still has to prove that the seized cartridges were indeed the property of petitioner"; however, the prosecution failed in this respect; this Court agrees with the OSG that since the employee of petitioner who allegedly discovered the theft of the subject cartridges, and who was supposedly the one who put identifying marks thereon was not presented in court, nobody could verify if the cartridges seized from respondents were the ones missing from the stockroom; the Court finds neither error nor grave abuse of discretion on the part of the MTC when it ruled that the prosecution failed to prove the essential element of taking in the alleged crime of theft. (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### ATTORNEYS

Administrative proceedings against 
- Respondent obtained a loan from complainant in the amount of P500,000.00 and in exchange thereof issued a worthless check to complainant; this fact alone is a ground for disciplinary action as it constitutes gross misconduct; it indicates his unfitness for the trust and confidence reposed upon him and his lack of personal honesty and good moral character rendering him unworthy of public confidence; in Ong v. Atty. Delos Santos, the Court explained that a lawyer who issues a worthless check is in breach of his oath to obey the laws; respondent, as a lawyer, should know that issuing a worthless check is a violation of The Bouncing Checks Laws (B.P. Blg. 22) for which he may be disciplined under Rule 138, Section 27 of the Rules of Court. (Andaya vs. Atty. Tumanda, A.C. No. 12209, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The Court finds it appropriate to impose on respondent the penalty of suspension from the practice of law for a period of three (3) years and a fine in the amount of P15,000.00, as recommended by the IBP Board of Governors, in line with the Court's ruling in similar cases; in Spouses Lopez v. Limos, the erring lawyer was suspended for three (3) years for violating Canon 11, Rule 12.04 of Canon 12, Rules 16.01 and 16.03 of Canon 16, and Rule 18.03 of Canon 18 of the CPR, among others; in Go v. Buri, the erring lawyer was suspended for two (2) years for violating Canon 16 and Rule 18.03 of Canon 18 of the CPR, among others, and ordered to pay a fine for failure to comply with the IBP-CBD's order to file an answer despite due notice. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)


- When lawyers, in the performance of their duties, act in a manner that prejudices not only the rights of their clients, but also of their colleagues and their colleagues' clients, appropriate disciplinary measures under the law, such as suspension and disbarment, must apply to rectify their wrongful acts. Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides: SEC. 27. Disbarment or suspension of attorneys by Supreme Court; grounds therefor. - A member of the bar may be disbarred or suspended from his office as attorney by the Supreme Court for any deceit, malpractice, or other gross misconduct in such office, grossly immoral conduct, or by reason of his conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or for any violation of the oath which he is required to take before admission to practice, or for a willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court, or for corruptly or willfully appearing as an attorney for a party to a case without authority so to do; the practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose of gain, either personally or through paid agents or brokers, constitutes malpractice. (Pagdanganan vs. Plata, A.C. No. 12701 [C.B.D. 12-3626], Feb. 26, 2020)

Attorney-client relationship 
- Atty. Mahinay did not unfairly criticize or disrespect Judge Medina in any way; on the contrary, he had, in fact, been circumspect in choosing the language he used in crafting his motion for reconsideration; at most, he might have been overzealous in defending his clients' cause, but this is not necessarily bad; the Court has always been mindful of the lawyer's bounden duty to defend his client's cause with utmost zeal for as long as he or she stays within the limits imposed by professional rules; Atty. Mahinay did not overstep these limits. (Zamora vs. Atty. Mahinay, A.C. No. 12622, Feb. 10, 2020 [Formerly CBD Case No. 15-4651])


- The filing of the administrative claim by respondents' counsel of record on behalf of their client gave rise to the presumption that they have the authority to file the same; this is anchored on the rule that "a lawyer is presumed to be properly authorized to represent any cause in which he appears, and no written power of attorney is required to authorize him to appear in court for his client"; the presumption in favor of the counsel's authority to appear in behalf of its client is a strong one, as it arises from the lawyer's pledge to act with honesty, candor and fairness and not to do any falsehood or misrepresentation; if a lawyer corruptly or willfully appears as an attorney for a party to a case without authority, he may be disciplined or punished for contempt as an officer of the court who has misbehaved in his official transaction; an attorney's appearance is also presumed to be with the previous knowledge and consent of the litigant until the contrary is shown. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The supposed lack of authority of respondents' counsel of record was thereafter cured when respondents executed a Special Power of Attorney and submitted the same with the CIR and before the court a quo; the CTA held that the said instrument clearly spells out the extent of authority granted to respondents' counsel and ratifies all prior acts done in pursuit of said authority, which includes the filing of respondents' administrative claim for refund; in Land Bank of the Philippines v. Pamintuan Dev't. Co., the Court held that "ratification retroacts to the date of the lawyer's first appearance and validates the action taken by him"; the effect is as if respondents themselves filed the administrative claim for refund on May 21, 2014, within the two-year prescriptive period provided under the NIRC of 1997, as amended; respondents' administrative claim was valid and timely filed. (Id.)


- Upon complainant's demand, respondent refused to return the amount of P244,865.00 he received as legal fees as well as all pertinent documents entrusted to him by complainant, including the original copy of OCT No. M-3772; respondent did not even offer any justifiable reason for such continued refusal; clearly, such act constitutes a violation of Canon 16 and Rules 16.01 and 16.03 of the CPR; the relationship between a lawyer and his client is highly fiduciary and prescribes on a lawyer a great fidelity and good faith; the highly fiduciary nature of this relationship imposes upon the lawyer the duty to account for the money or property collected or received for or from his client; thus, a lawyer's failure to return upon demand the funds held by him on behalf of his client, as in this case, gives rise to the presumption that he has appropriated the same for his own use in violation of the trust reposed in him by his client; this act is a gross violation of general morality, as well as of professional ethics. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)

Compliance with IBP'S lawful directives 
- To further aggravate respondent's administrative liability, the Court notes respondent's repeated disregard of the IBP-CBD's orders and proceedings; records show that despite being required to do so, respondent failed to file his answer, mandatory conference brief, and position paper; he also failed to appear at the schedule mandatory conference despite due notice; respondent merely filed a motion to reset the mandatory conference and to hold in abeyance the filing of his position paper, which caused undue delay in the resolution of the instant administrative case, in violation of Canons 11, 12, and Rule 12.04 of the CPR; as a member of the IBP, respondent is duty-bound to comply with all the IBP's lawful directives in deference to its authority over him. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)

Conduct of 
- A penalty of one-year suspension from the practice of law is usually imposed upon a lawyer who issues a worthless check; considering the attendant circumstances in the instant case, the Court agrees with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) and the Office of the Bar Confidant (OBC) that the penalty imposed should be increased to three years; aside from issuing a worthless check, respondent has acted in utmost bad faith when he sold to another person the Mercedes Benz he previously sold to complainant as full payment for the loan obligation; such act is a clear violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR); further, his deliberate failure to settle his obligation despite repeated demands is in itself a gross misconduct; also, respondent has been using several addresses to avoid being traced and to evade his obligation to complainant; respondent even refused to answer the accusations against him and to appear in the mandatory conferences despite due notice, thereby causing undue delay in the resolution of the instant case. (Andaya vs. Atty. Tumanda, A.C. No. 12209, Feb. 18, 2020)


- Lawyers are licensed officers of the courts who are empowered to appear, prosecute, and defend; and upon whom peculiar duties, responsibilities, and liabilities are devolved by law as a consequence; membership in the Bar imposes upon them certain obligations; mandated to maintain the dignity of the legal profession, they must conduct themselves honorably and fairly; any violation of these standards exposes the lawyer to administrative liability; case law instructs that "lawyers should treat their opposing counsels and other lawyers with courtesy, dignity, and civility; a great part of their comfort, as well as of their success at the bar, depends upon their relations with their professional brethren; since they deal constantly with each other, they must treat one another with trust and respect; any undue ill feeling between clients should not influence counsels in their conduct and demeanor toward each other; mutual bickering, unjustified recriminations, and offensive behavior among lawyers not only detract from the dignity of the legal profession, but also constitute highly unprofessional conduct subject to disciplinary action"; in Noble III v. Ailes, the Court held that the hurling of insulting language to describe the opposing counsel is considered conduct unbecoming of the legal profession which, as ruled in Buot v. Jubay, should never be countenanced as it tends to degrade the dignity of the legal profession. (Nava II vs. Atty. Artuz, A.C. No. 7253, Feb. 18, 2020)


- Respondent's acts of calling Atty. Nava II and his father "barbaric, nomadic, and outrageous" and baselessly imputing to Atty. Nava II the use of his alleged influence as the godson of the City Prosecutor who, by virtue thereof, allegedly had the audacity to display "his bad manners and wrong conduct and arrogance" in an official pleading falls short of the conduct being exhorted by Canon 8 to all members of the Bar; such use of intemperate language and aspersions has no place in the dignity of judicial forum; membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions such that a lawyer's words and actions directly affect the public's opinion of the legal profession; any violation of these conditions exposes the lawyer to administrative liability, as in this case; respondent had violated several canons of professional and ethical conduct expected from her as a lawyer and an officer of the court; membership in the legal profession is a privilege, and whenever it is made to appear that an attorney is no longer worthy of the trust and confidence of his clients and the public, it becomes not only the right but also the duty of the Court to withdraw the same; she is DISBARRED from the practice of law and her name is ordered STRICKEN off the Roll of Attorneys, effective immediately. (Nava II vs. Atty. Artuz, A.C. No. 7253, Feb. 18, 2020)

Deceit —The Court finds Salgado guilty of deceit; from the evidence presented by Lapitan, which was not refuted by Salgado after due notice, it is clear that Salgado had no intention to pay the contracted amount for the 26 June 2010 event; the records show that the contract amount has not been settled by Salgado to this date; Salgado committed deceit by making it appear that he forgot to bring with him the necessary cash to pay for the contracted amount when the terms of the banquet event contract clearly indicate that the fifty percent (50 percent ) down payment should have been made as early as upon signing the contract; instead, Salgado employed deceit in convincing Lapitan that he would pay the total contracted amount upon the event's conclusion and Lapitan believed Salgado in good faith knowing that the latter was a lawyer and was fully aware of his legal obligation to pay the terms of the contract; Salgado employed deceit on Lapitan when instead of paying in cash after the event, Salgado issued a worthless postdated check three (3) days after the completion of the event or on 29 June 2010; clear and preponderant evidence was presented by Lapitan which remained unrebutted by Salgado who refused to participate in the IBP-CBD proceedings even after notices were sent to both Salgado's previous and present addresses; consequently, the evidence presented by Lapitan stands. (Lapitan vs. Atty. Salgado, A.C. No. 12452, Feb. 18, 2020)

Disbarment 
- Every person is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; settled is the rule that in disbarment proceedings, the complainant must satisfactorily establish the allegations of his or her complaint through substantial evidence; mere allegations without proof are disregarded considering the gravity of the penalty prayed for; charges based on mere suspicion and speculation cannot be given credence; the Court agrees with the IBP that the complained act does not constitute any violation of the Rules of Court, the Notarial Rules, nor the Code of Professional Responsibility; respondent merely performed his duty when he attested to the fact that Lotho personally appeared and signed the said letter before him; We agree with the IBP that the truth or falsity of the contents of the letter is the responsibility of the affiant Lotho and not of the respondent, especially since no substantial evidence was presented to prove that he knowingly notarized a false document. (ICK, et al. vs. Atty. Amazona, A.C. No. 12375, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Salgado clearly continues to disregard the lawful orders of the Court; Salgado remains a fugitive from justice in both his Estafa case under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code before the Regional Trial Court of Tagaytay City and violation of B.P. Blg. 22 in the Municipal Trial Court of Tagaytay City; Salgado has evaded both proceedings before the trial courts and the IBP-CBD; as a member of the legal profession, Salgado has the duty to obey the orders and processes of the Court; the conduct of Salgado clearly demonstrates the lack of respect for the Court and the Court's lawful procedures which cannot be tolerated by the Court; Section 5(5), Article VIII of the 1987 Constitution recognizes the Court's authority to discipline members of the Bar; in Sps. Floran v. Atty. Ediza, the Court held that in imposing the penalty of disbarment, the Court is aware that the power to disbar is a power exercised by the Court with utmost caution and such power is solely exercised only in cases of misconduct that seriously affect the moral standing and character of members of the Bar as officers of the Court; the practice of law is not a vested right but a privilege, a privilege clothed with public interest; to enjoy the privilege of practicing law as officers of the Court, lawyers must adhere to the rigid standards of mental fitness and maintain the highest degree of morality; Salgado's utmost disrespect to the Courts' proceedings coupled with his deceitful conduct on Lapitan warrant such grave penalty. (Lapitan vs. Atty. Salgado, A.C. No. 12452, Feb. 18, 2020)


- While lawyers are mandated to act with dignity and in a manner that inspires confidence to the legal profession, their rights must still be protected just like every ordinary individual; the legal profession and the threat of disbarment should not be used as a means to provoke lawyers who are acting well within their rights. (Spouses Nocuenca vs. Atty. Bensi, A.C. No. 12609, Feb. 10, 2020)

Duties to clients 
- Every lawyer owes fidelity to the causes and concerns of his clients; he must be ever mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him by his clients; his duty to safeguard the clients' interests commences from his engagement as such, and lasts until his effective release by the clients; sometime in 2004, complainant engaged the services of respondent for the processing of the transfer and registration of a land title, and in connection therewith, paid the latter the amount of P244,865.00; however, twelve (12) years had passed until the filing of the administrative complaint without respondent having rendered the services he had assumed; such neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him by complainant constitutes flagrant violations of Canons 2, 17, 18 and Rule 18.03 of the CPR; it is settled that once a lawyer takes up the cause of his client, he is duty-bound to serve the latter with competence, and to attend to such client's cause with diligence, care, and devotion whether he accepts it for a fee or for free; a lawyer's neglect of a legal matter entrusted to him by his client constitutes inexcusable negligence for which he must be held administratively liable. (Jacolbia vs. Atty. Panganiban, A.C. No. 12627, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The relationship between a lawyer and a client is "imbued with utmost trust and confidence"; lawyers are expected to exercise the necessary diligence and competence in managing cases entrusted to them; they commit not only to review cases or give legal advice, but also to represent their clients to the best of their ability without need to be reminded by either the client or the court; when a lawyer agrees to act as a counsel, he guarantees that he will exercise that reasonable degree of care and skill demanded by the character of the business he undertakes to do, to protect the clients' interests and take all steps or do all acts necessary therefor; conversely, a lawyer's negligence in fulfilling his duties subjects him to disciplinary action; while such negligence or carelessness is incapable of exact formulation, the Court has consistently held that the lawyer's mere failure to perform the obligations due his client is per se a violation; the requirement and repercussions of non-submission of an appellant's brief are provided for under Rules 44 and 50 of the Revised Rules of Court; as a lawyer, respondent is presumed to know the procedural rules in appellate practice; this includes the rule that when the appellant fails to file the appeal brief within the prescribed period, the appeal shall be dismissed; here, respondent admitted to have intentionally not filed the appeal brief, albeit he gives two inconsistent reasons i.e. one, he was informed that the cases had been amicably settled and two, his supposed effort to contact his clients which proved futile aside from the fact that his clients failed to follow up with him; he was grossly negligent in his duty to file the required appeal brief, causing the appeal to be dismissed and his clients' to perpetually lose the chance to have the case reviewed and possibly to reverse the judgment against them; respondent is guilty of violation of Canon 18 and Rule 18.02 of the CPR; the fact that complainants' claim over the 2,507 square meter land is deemed lost forever due to respondent's failure to forthrightly perform his duty as complainants' counsel and for lack of any showing of empathy or remorse for the unfortunate incident that he, himself, had caused; penalty of suspension from the practice of law for six (6) months. (Sta. Maria, et al. vs. Atayde, Jr., A.C. No. 9197, Feb. 12, 2020)

Gross misconduct 
- The Attorney's Oath is clear that Atty. Plata must "not wittingly or willingly promote or sue any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid nor consent to the same." Section 20(c) and (g), Rule 138 of the Rules of Court also emphasize the relevant duties of Atty. Plata applicable to this case, to wit: SEC. 20. Duties of attorneys. - It is the duty of an attorney: x x x (c) To counsel or maintain such actions or proceedings only as appear to him to be just, and such defenses only as he believes to be honestly debatable under the law; x x x (g) Not to encourage either the commencement or the continuance of an action or proceedings, or delay any man's cause, from any corrupt motive or interest; the Court notes that Atty. Plata did not deny that he had filed several civil, criminal and administrative cases against the opposing parties and their counsels. Upon examination of the records, it becomes apparent that these suits are mere harassing tactics against Pagdanganan, his co-respondents and their counsel; The Court is mindful of Atty. Plata's duty to defend his client's cause with utmost zeal; however, professional rules, as above-quoted, impose limits on a lawyer's zeal and hedge it with necessary restrictions and qualifications; Atty. Plata's filing of several cases against the adverse parties and their counsel lays bare his intent to repress the opposing counsel from exerting utmost effort in protecting his clients' interest; the filing of several groundless suits and the reservation of filing another perjury suit in the future despite the pendency of another perjury case reveal Atty. Plata's gross indiscretion as a colleague in the legal profession, in blatant violation of his oath and duties as a lawyer; Atty. Plata's harassing tactics of filing multiple groundless and baseless suits are contrary to the Rules and Canons in the Code of Professional Responsibility (Canon 8, Rule 10.03, Rule 12.02, Rule 12.04) (Pagdanganan vs. Plata, A.C. No. 12701 [C.B.D. 12-3626], Feb. 26, 2020)

Practice of law 
- Respondent's admission to the Philippine Bar has long been held in abeyance due to the criminal cases pending against him before the Office of the City Prosecutor of Quezon City; per the rollo, it appears that all criminal charges against him has been dismissed except for the most recent one filed in 2019; the timing of the filing of this case, however, is highly suspect as it came just as the other criminal charges against respondent were dismissed on June 28, 2018, January 4, 2019, and October 15, 2019; thus, it can no longer be denied that the manifest intention of complainant in successively filing these criminal cases against respondent is to prevent him from taking the Lawyer's Oath and signing the Roll of Attorneys 
- the last two steps needed to be undertaken by respondent to become a full-fledged lawyer; the dismissal of all the other criminal charges against respondent, coupled with the various certifications of good moral character in his favor, is sufficient for the Court to conclude that respondent possesses the moral qualifications required of lawyers; though it is true that the practice of law is not a right but a privilege, the Court will not unjustifiably withhold this privilege from respondent, who has clearly shown that he is both intellectually and morally qualified to join the legal profession; and so, after almost six years of waiting, the Court finally grants respondent's prayer for admission to the Philippine Bar. (De Zuzuarregui vs. De Zuzuarregui, B.M. No. 2796, Feb. 11, 2020)

Violation of Lawyer's Oath and breach of ethics of the profession 
- The Court entertains no doubt that Atty. Viaje, through fraud, duress, and coercion, prevailed upon complainant to surrender her shares of stock in GRDC by signing a Voting Trust Agreement and making himself and two others stockholders and directors in the said corporation; the Court has held that, "when the integrity of a member of the bar is challenged, it is not enough that he[/she] denies the charges against him[/her]; he[/she] must meet the issue and overcome the evidence against him[/her]; he[/she] must show proof that he[/she] still maintains that degree of morality and integrity, which at all times is expected of him/her; Atty. Viaje wasted the opportunity given to rebut complainants' accusations. Instead of meeting them head on, he was evasive in his answers; Atty. Viaje violated his oath as a lawyer and breached the ethics of his profession; "[Lawyers] are expected at all times to uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession and refrain from any act or omission which might lessen the trust and confidence reposed by the public in the fidelity, honesty, and integrity of the legal profession"; Atty. Viaje failed to live up to the standards and demands required of him as a member of the Bar; Atty. Viaje is DISBARRED and his name ORDERED STRICKEN OFF from the Roll of Attorneys effective immediately without prejudice to the civil and criminal cases pending or to be filed against him. (Puno vs. Atty. Viaje, A.C. No. 12085, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### ATTORNEY'S FEES

Award of 
- Since Roxas was compelled to litigate to enforce his rights and protect his interests, he is entitled to attorney's fees equivalent to ten percent (10 percent ) of the total monetary award due him in accordance with Article 111 of the Labor Code and Article 2208 of the Civil Code. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### BILL OF RIGHTS

Right to due process of law 
- Due process, in its classic formulation, means that any person having interest to the thing in litigation, or the outcome of the judgment, must be notified and given an opportunity to defend that interest; conforming to the constitutional guarantee of due process of law is the principle that a person cannot be prejudiced by a ruling rendered in an action or proceeding in which he was not made a party; the essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard or, as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's side or an opportunity to seek reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of; in this case, even assuming that Pedro was an indispensable party, he cannot claim denial of due process for the simple reason that he had the opportunity to question the judgment of the DARAB-Region VIII. (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)

Right to speedy disposition of cases 
- Cagang v. Sandiganbayan clarified that in cases before the Office of the Ombudsman, the fact-finding investigation is not deemed included in the preliminary investigation for the purpose of determining the existence of inordinate delay, because the investigations are not yet adversarial proceedings against the accused; thus, in evaluating cases invoking the right to speedy disposition of cases, "a case is deemed to have commenced from the filing of the formal complaint and the subsequent conduct of the preliminary investigation"; the Ombudsman ought to provide a reasonable period based on: (1) its experience; (2) the number of the accused; (3) the complexity of the evidence; and (4) the issues involved; however, the burden of proving that there was violation of the right to speedy disposition lies with the defense; it must be able to show that the proceedings were prolonged longer than what is reasonably necessary; moreover, the defense must show that it exerted efforts to protect its constitutional rights; failure to timely raise the alleged violation of its right operates against the defendant because sleeping on the right indicates his or her acquiescence to the delay; the delay must not be attributable to the defense to conclude that there is a violation of the right to speedy disposition of cases; delaying tactics employed by the accused will be taken against him or her; this covers situations such as "failing to appear despite summons, filing needless motions against interlocutory actions, or requesting unnecessary postponements that will prevent courts or tribunals to properly adjudicate the case"; Cagang summarizes the clearer guide in resolving cases on right to speedy disposition of cases or right to speedy trial. (Republic vs. Sandiganbayan (Special Second Division), et al., G.R. 231144, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In determining the length of delay, Dansal v. Hernandez recognized that the period must include the investigation even before the trial commenced; in criminal prosecutions, rules on preliminary investigation under Rule 112, Section 3 of the Rules of Court come to play; Section 1 of R.A. 8493, otherwise known as the Speedy Trial Act, also laid down the time limit of 180 days for the entire trial; the Guidelines for Decongesting Holding Jails by Enforcing the Right of the Accused to Bail and to Speedy Trial likewise provide for strict time limits that must be observed, among other laws; in cases filed before quasi-judicial agencies, there is no law providing for the period to be observed in terms of disposition of the case; in cases before the Office of the Ombudsman, the Constitution only mandates it to act promptly on cases. (Id.)


- The right to speedy disposition of cases is constitutionally guaranteed under Article III, Section 16 of the Constitution; this right is different and distinct from the right to speedy trial, which is enshrined under Article III, Section 14(2); under the 1973 Constitution, the right to speedy disposition of cases was first crafted and integrated into our legal system; prior to this, the 1935 Constitution only carried the right to speedy trial, which may only be cited in criminal prosecutions; thus, the right to speedy to disposition of cases, which may be raised even before quasi-judicial and administrative bodies involving civil, criminal, and administrative cases, provides a broader scope of protection; the third constitutional provision mandating speedy dispensation of justice is found in Article VIII, Section 15, which provides for a period within which a case must be decided and resolved by courts; nevertheless, the right to speedy disposition of cases still embraces a greater scope because Article VIII, Section 15 only covers the period after the submission of cases; similar to the right to speedy trial, the right to speedy disposition of cases primarily seeks to prevent delay in the administration of justice. (Id.)


- The right to speedy disposition of cases is violated only when there is inordinate delay, such that the proceedings are "attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or when unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for and secured, or when without cause or unjustifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to elapse without the party having his case tried"; inordinate delay was first introduced in Tatad v. Sandiganbayan; Tatad held that the determination of whether or not there is a violation of speedy disposition of cases applies on a case-to-case basis; thus, the concept of speedy disposition is relative; there is no hard-and-fast mathematical rule on the reckoning of time involved and facts peculiar to each case must be taken into account; this Court carved a standard test in resolving these cases; Martin v. Ver adopted the "balancing test" which provides four (4) factors as its guide in determining the existence of inordinate delay, namely: (1) length of delay; (2) reason for delay; (3) defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his or her right; and (4) prejudice caused to the defendant as a result of the delay; however, these factors must be taken into account together with the other circumstances of the case; furthermore, the totality of the facts must be weighed and evaluated. (Id.)


- This Court finds that there was no violation of private respondent's right to speedy disposition of cases; following the Cagang guidelines, it is clear that the prosecution bears the burden of proof; from the time the Complaint was filed on January 18, 2005, until the Resolution was finally approved by the Ombudsman on June 23, 2008, it took the prosecution three (3) and a half years to conclude the preliminary investigation; this is beyond the prescribed period for the determination of probable cause; the hearing must be concluded 15 days from the submission of the counter-affidavits and afterwards, the investigating officer must determine whether or not there is probable cause to formally charge the accused 10 days after the hearing; subsequently, the rules require that five (5) days after the resolution, it must be forwarded to the Ombudsman, who shall act upon the resolution within 10 days from receipt; here, the conduct of the preliminary investigation was clearly beyond the period prescribed by the rules; bearing the burden of proof, the prosecution must show that it followed the rules in the conduct of the preliminary investigation, that the complexity of the issues and volume of evidence caused the delay, and that there is no prejudice caused to the accused; first, petitioner showed that it followed the procedure leading to the resolution of the preliminary investigation; second, petitioner succinctly explained that the multiple respondents and numerous documents involved made the case more complex and difficult to resolve; third, this Court agrees with petitioner that the allegations of private respondent are insufficient to conclude that there was prejudice; a claim of prejudice must have a conclusive and factual basis; pure speculation and mere generalization will not work in favor of the accused and there must be an actual, specific, and real injury to his or her rights; prejudice cannot be established by "conjectural supplications of prejudice or by dubious invocations of constitutional rights"; private respondent failed to elaborate and specifically allege that the prejudice caused towards him by the prolonged proceedings are actual and real, and that the nature and degree of these problems were oppressive; fourth, private respondent contributed to the delay; private respondent moved twice for an extension to file his counter-affidavit, and before eventually filing, he filed another motion to consolidate the case with another complaint against him; his co-accused likewise filed motions for extension; fifth, while there is no precise mathematical reckoning of the delay, the Sandiganbayan erred in the computation of the period; while it took 10 years from the filing of the Complaint until the Information was filed before the Sandiganbayan, respondent Sandiganbayan failed to take into account that there was a pending petition for certiorari filed before this Court; thus, the delay was inevitable; lastly, private respondent is deemed to have waived his right; in the span of three (3) years of preliminary investigation, he never raised this contention and instead, the allowed the investigation to drag on; while the Constitution guarantees the right of the accused to speedy disposition of cases, this right is not a magical invocation which can be cunningly used by the accused for his or her advantage; this right is not a last line of remedy when accused find themselves at the losing end of the proceedings; the State's duty to prosecute cases is equally as important, and this cannot be disregarded at the whim of the accused, especially when it appears that the contention was raised as a mere afterthought; in any case, this Court finds that the period from the filing of the Complaint, to the conduct of the preliminary investigation, and up to the filing of the Information, was not attended or characterized by inordinate delay; there was nothing vexatious, capricious, and oppressive which would warrant the outright dismissal of the case. (Id.)

#### CAUSE OF ACTION

Elements 
- "A cause of action is the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another"; it has three constitutive elements: first, a legal right accruing to the plaintiff; second, a duty on the defendant's part to respect such right; and third, an act or omission by the defendant violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of defendant to the plaintiff; Tocoms bases its cause of action for damages upon Articles 19, 20, and 21 of the Civil Code, and its "constitutionally vested right to property and to peaceful, uninterrupted, and fair conduct of business"; according to Tocoms, the acts committed by PELI during and after the effectivity of the agreement are tainted with bad faith and malice in view of the significant investments made by the former during the effectivity of the Distribution Agreement and in the run-up to the expiration thereof in 2012. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

Test in determining sufficiency 
- In determining the sufficiency of a cause of action, the test is, whether or not, admitting hypothetically the truth of the allegations of fact made in the complaint, the court may validly grant the relief prayed for in the complaint; as correctly pointed out during the deliberations of this case, if the foregoing allegations in Tocoms' complaint are hypothetically admitted, these acts constitute bad faith on the part of respondent PELI in the exercise of its rights under the Distributorship Agreement, in violation of Article 19, and as punished by Article 21; the court may validly award damages in favor of Tocoms as prayed for in its Complaint; while all the foregoing acts committed by PELI are justifiable under the terms of the Distributorship Agreement, the question of whether or not these acts were committed with malice or in bad faith – in light of the allegations in the Complaint – still remains disputed. (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### CERTIORARI

Grave abuse of discretion 
- The Orders issued by the RTC judge constituted a valid exercise of her judicial authority and jurisdiction; mere error, if any, in the substantive discussion of an Order, neither provides nor furnishes sufficient grounds to sustain a certiorari proceeding before the Supreme Tribunal; certiorari being an extraordinary writ, will lie only where it is clearly shown that the lower body or tribunal had acted with grave abuse of discretion, or where the power is exercised in a grossly arbitrary and despotic manner; even thus assuming that Her Honor erred or made a mistake in finding that there was no probable cause to indict respondent for Libel, such mistake does not amount to a grave abuse of discretion or lack or excess of jurisdiction. (Domingo vs. Macapagal, G.R. 242577, Feb. 26, 2020)


- There is grave abuse of discretion when an act is: (1) done contrary to the Constitution, the law or jurisprudence; or (2) executed whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily, out of malice, ill will or personal bias; manifest disregard of the basic rules and procedures constitutes a grave abuse of discretion; here, Presiding Judge Xenos did not act without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in not approving the plea bargain of Sayre; there was a continuing objection on the part of the prosecution; the parties failed to arrive at a "mutually satisfactory disposition of the case" that may be submitted for the court's approval; the RTC correctly ordered the continuation of the proceedings because there was no mutual agreement to plea bargain. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)

Petition for 
- In dismissing the Complaint and denying the Motion for Reconsideration, the Ombudsman relied on the Ombudsman Act of 1989, cited relevant jurisprudence, and squarely applied the foregoing to the facts of the case at hand; this negates Dormido's allegation that grave abuse of discretion might have attended the Ombudsman's conclusions; whether these determinations by the Ombudsman were correct or wrong is not remediable by certiorari; whimsicality in the issuance of a decision, not accuracy, is the core of certiorari proceedings; an unfavorable evaluation of the evidence presented by a party will not be inquired into via certiorari unless it is shown that it was done in an arbitrary manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal enmity. (Dormido vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 198241, Feb. 24, 2020)


- It was held in St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC that the decision of the NLRC may be reviewed by the CA through a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65; but because certiorari is not the same as an appeal, it is not a means to review the entire decision of the NLRC for reversible errors on questions of fact and law; apparently limiting itself to the arguments contained in the certiorari petition, the CA resolved only the issue of whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in admitting Dela Cruz's appeal; the limits of the review under Rule 65 affect the Court's review under Rule 45 assailing the CA's ruling in cases involving alleged grave abuse of discretion by the NLRC; given that a review under Rule 45 is limited only to questions of law, the question of law that must be resolved is whether the CA correctly ruled on the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC; here, the task of the Court is to determine whether the CA was correct in holding that the NLRC did not gravely abuse its discretion in finding that Dela Cruz seasonably filed her appeal; no whim or caprice on the part of the NLRC when it relied on Dela Cruz's allegation as contained in her Memorandum of Appeal that she received the Labor Arbiter's Decision, especially when there was no contrary proof presented by petitioners; the CA correctly denied the certiorari petition on this ground. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Petitioner did not present any explanation for failing to timely file a petition under Rule 45 and filing instead a petition under Rule 65; the remedy of certiorari under Rule 65, as a general rule, cannot be availed of as a substitute for the lost remedy of an ordinary appeal, including that under Rule 45. (Fernandez vs. Court of Appeals, Twenty-Third Division, Cagayan de Oro City, et al., G.R. 233460, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court agrees with the ruling of the RTC that the disputed acts of the MTC in denying admissibility to the subject ink cartridges as part of the prosecution's evidence, its appreciation of the entirety of evidence presented by both parties to the case, and its subsequent finding that the prosecution failed to prove the crime charged, are assailable as errors of judgment and are not reviewable by the extraordinary remedy of certiorari; the Court finds no error in the ruling of the RTC that petitioner was not able to establish its allegation of grave abuse of discretion on the part of the MTC; where a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court alleges grave abuse of discretion, the petitioner should establish that the respondent court or tribunal acted in a capricious, whimsical, arbitrary or despotic manner in the exercise of its jurisdiction as to be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction; this Court has explained that: The term "grave abuse of discretion" has a specific meaning; an act of a court or tribunal can only be considered as with grave abuse of discretion when such act is done in a "capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction"; the abuse of discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an "evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility"; the use of a petition for certiorari is restricted only to "truly extraordinary cases wherein the act of the lower court or quasi-judicial body is wholly void"; the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65 can only strike an act down for having been done with grave abuse of discretion if the petitioner could manifestly show that such act was patent and gross; as found by the RTC, there was no hint of whimsicality, nor of gross and patent abuse of discretion as would amount to an evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law on the part of the MTC; if at all, the mistake committed by the MTC is only an error of judgment and not of jurisdiction, which would have amounted to a grave abuse of discretion. (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The documents required to be attached in a petition for certiorari that is filed before the CA, such as the instant case, are found under Section 3, Rule 46 and Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court; as explained in Republic v. Carmel Devt. Inc., Rule 46 primarily governs original actions for certiorari filed in the CA, but Rule 65 generally serves to supplement it; specifically, Section 2, Rule 46 expressly states that Rule 46 shall apply to original actions for certiorari, and that except as otherwise provided in Rule 46, the actions for certiorari shall be governed by Rule 65; as such, Rules 46 and 65 co-exist with each other and should be construed so as to give effect to every provision of both rules; in Air Philippines Corp. v. Zamora, the Court explained that the foregoing rules require two sets of documents to be attached to the petition: (1) a duplicate original or certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject thereof; and (2) copies of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent thereto; here, the copy of the RTC Decision dated July 21, 2016 with the notation "ORIGINAL SIGNED" attached to the petition for certiorari was not a duplicate copy; thus not compliant with the requirement under Section 3, Rule 46 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65; however, after the denial of his petition for certiorari, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration with a certified true copy of the RTC Decision dated July 21, 2016; hence, the Court considers it as substantial compliance with the requirement under Section 3, Rule 46 in relation to Section 1, Rule 65; As to petitioner's purported failure to attach copies of other pertinent pleadings/documents and other relevant portions of the records, the CA should not have been too rigid in applying the rules to dismiss the petition based on mere technicalities; applying our pronouncements in Jaro v. Court of Appeals and Air Philippines Corp. v Zamora, the CA should have considered petitioner's submissions attached to the motion for reconsideration as substantial compliance to the formal requirements under Section 1 of Rule 65. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The very basic prerequisite of a petition for certiorari is to allege the acts constituting grave abuse purportedly committed by the public officer, tribunal, or court; Dormido aims to overturn the factual findings and legal conclusions of the Ombudsman; she sums up the arguments presented in her Petition for Certiorari; the arguments do not allege errors of jurisdiction but errors of judgment; Dormido complains that Adobo and De la Peña, in the exercise of their official duties, gave the spouses Manahan an unwarranted benefit, and that despite prima facie showing of violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019, the Ombudsman dismissed her Complaint; such accusations against respondents, without anything more, cannot be considered as grave abuse of discretion amounting to an evasion of a positive duty; these accusation only express mere disagreement with the Ombudsman's judgment, which does not proceed from grave abuse of discretion; the Petition contained no allegations of the Ombudsman's supposed acts of grave abuse of discretion adequate to reverse the latter's pronouncements, and indict respondents instead for the charges of graft and corruption; there is no clear showing of arbitrariness on the part of the Ombudsman in dismissing Dormido's Complaint; grave abuse of discretion could have been held against the Ombudsman had it declared in its assailed Order that there was reasonable ground to indict respondents for violation of Section 3(e) of RA 3019 as so desired by Dormido, when facts and jurisprudence prevailing at the time of the issuance of Deed of Conveyance No. V-200022 clearly instructed otherwise; the term grave abuse of discretion has, ironically, fallen victim to procedural abuse; as a last-ditch remedy to turn the odds in their favor, vengeful litigants resort to indiscriminate imputation of the term to the public officer that issued a verdict adverse to them, in manifest indifference to the soundness of its exercise or the frailty of their cause; Rules must not be stretched for personal retribution, or even if such purpose be pursued, it must have a solid grounding in fact and law. (Dormido vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 198241, Feb. 24, 2020)


- While petitioners raise errors of judgement that fall outside the purview of the remedy sought, procedural rules may be relaxed in view of the ultimate goal of rendering substantive justice; Microsoft Corp. v. Best Deal Computer Center teaches that a petition for certiorari corrects only errors of jurisdiction, and cannot correct errors of judgment; as such, a Rule 65 petition "must raise not errors of judgment but the acts and circumstances showing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction"; in Punongbayan-Visitacion, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, which was dismissed for being an improper remedy; upon reaching this Court, it was held that a petition for certiorari may be treated as an appeal if the "interest of substantial justice warrants the relaxation of the rules"; further, in Curammeng v. People, procedural rules were relaxed "where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition"; likewise, an argument raised for the first time on appeal may still be considered in order to recognize "jurisprudential developments since the RTC decision and the needs for substantial justice"; Olivarez was decided in 2014, and clarified relevant points of law that may not have been apparent to the lower courts at the time; thus, petitioners' argument regarding "reasonable rentals" may be duly considered; while Punongbayan-Visitacion stressed the importance of timeliness in filing a petition for certiorari, even compliance with prescriptive periods may be relaxed when "the application of the Rule would tend to frustrate rather than promote justice"; thus, the merits of the petition and the need to accord substantial justice should outweigh a petition's nomenclature and the parties' procedural lapses. (Spouses Godinez vs. Spouses Norman, G.R. 225449, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CIVIL OR DEATH INDEMNITY

Grant of 
- Civil or death indemnity is mandatory and granted to the heirs of the victim without need of proof other than the commission of the crime; initially fixed by the Civil Code at P3,000.00, the amount of the indemnity is currently fixed at P50,000.00. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### CIVIL REGISTER

Certificate of Live Birth 
- Generally, the entries recorded in the birth certificate: (1) the date and hour of birth; (2) the sex and nationality of the infant; (3) the names, citizens, and religion of parents; (4) the civil status of parents; and (5) the place where the infant was born, all correspond to facts existing at the time of birth as argued by the Republic; however, reading Article 407 of the Civil Code in conjunction with Article 412 of the Civil Code, even acts or events that occurred after birth may be recorded in the certificate of live birth; the reason is that Article 412 of the Civil Code uses the word "changed," which implies the occurrence of an event subsequent to birth may be recorded in the civil register; that an event occurring after birth may be recorded in the civil register was pronounced in Co v. The Civil Register, a case cited by Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas in support of their Petition before the trial court; to prohibit the annotation of events subsequent to birth in the certificate of live birth is to deny a person the right to form his or her own identity; more than a "historical record of the facts as they existed at the time of birth," the birth certificate is an instrument of individuation. (Republic, Represented by the Special Committee on Naturalization (SCN) vs. Chia Lao, et al., G.R. 205218, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### CIVIL SERVICE LAW AND ITS IMPLEMENTING RULES ON ADMINISTRATIVE CASES

Length of service 
- Length of service should be taken against Tabasa, coupled with the fact that this is already his second offense; length of service is not a magic word that would automatically be considered as a mitigating circumstance in favor of the party invoking it; length of service is an alternative circumstance: it could either be a mitigating or aggravating circumstance depending on the factual milieu of each case; Tabasa's length of service cannot be considered as a mitigating circumstance since it is the number of years in the service that seemingly gave him the impression that he could do away with his teasing and offensive humor to the detriment of his co-workers; where a government employee concerned takes advantage of his long years of service and position in public office, length of service may not be considered in lowering the penalty. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)

Simple misconduct 
- Under the Civil Service Law and its implementing rules on administrative cases, the penalty for the second offense of simple misconduct is dismissal from the service; thus, as provided by law, there is no penalty that should be imposed on Tabasa other than the penalty of dismissal; under the circumstances, his dismissal is warranted; his years of service should have impelled him to set a good example to his co-employees and other civil servants instead of flagrantly and shamelessly violating the law and undermining the professionalism and integrity required from public servants; Tabasa should be reminded that a public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of professionalism, honesty and integrity for no less than the Constitution mandates that a public office is a public trust and public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives; these principles should be taken as working standards by all in the public service. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CLERKS OF COURT

Duties 
- Among all those duties entrusted to a Clerk of Court is the safekeeping of court funds; emphasized in Re: Report on the Financial Audit Conducted at the Municipal Trial Court, Baliuag, Bulacan, to wit: Clerks of Court perform a delicate function as designated custodians of the court's funds, revenues, records, properties, and premises; they are generally regarded as treasurer, accountant, guard, and physical plant manager thereof; it is the duty of the Clerks of Court to faithfully perform their duties and responsibilities; they are the chief administrative officers of their respective courts; it is also their duty to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the collection of cash bonds; Clerks of Court are officers of the law who perform vital functions in the prompt and sound administration of justice; an unwarranted failure to fulfill these responsibilities deserves administrative sanctions and not even the full payment of the collection shortages will exempt the accountable officer from liability. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Salunoy, Court Stenographer, A.M. No. P-07-2354, Feb. 4, 2020)


- As laudably depicted in The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, a clerk of court is indispensable in any judicial system, to wit: A Judge alone cannot make the Court function as it should; in the over-all scheme of judicial business, many non-judicial concerns, intricately and inseparably interwoven with the trial and adjudication of cases, must perforce be performed by other individuals that make up the team that complements the Court; of these individuals, the Clerk of Court eclipses the others in function, responsibilities, importance and prestige; the Clerk of Court has general administrative supervision over all the personnel of the Court; as regards the Court's funds and revenues, records, properties and premises, said officer is the custodian; the nature of the work and of the office mandates that the Clerk of Court be an individual of competence, honesty, and integrity. (Id.)


- Barcelona stated that she lacked the necessary training and experience in maintaining legal records and safely keeping the physical evidence in the custody of the court; her averments bare Atty. Toledo's carelessness in supervising the activities of his subordinates especially the court personnel to whom his administrative function was merely delegated; he relied entirely on Barcelona and passed to her all the responsibilities of an evidence custodian without ensuring that she possesses the skill set to effectively perform custodial duties; as the Branch Clerk of Court, he remains responsible for the shortcomings of his subordinate. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)


- The Manual for Clerks of Court and the Rules of Court define the role of a clerk of court in the administration of justice; Section E(2), paragraph 2.2.3, Chapter VI of the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court reads: All exhibits used as evidence and turned over to the court and before the easels involving such evidence shall have been terminated shall be under the custody and safekeeping of the Clerk of Court; Section 7 of Rule 136 of the Rules of Court also provides: SEC. 7. Safekeeping of property. 
- The clerk shall safely keep all records, papers, files, exhibits and public property committed to his charge, including the library of the court, and the seals and furniture belonging to his office; primary duty of safekeeping all the records and pieces of evidence submitted to the court in cases pending before it including the properties furnished to his office; this obligation extends to ensuring that the records and exhibits in each case are complete and accounted for, and continues even after the termination of the case as long as the same have yet to be disposed or destructed in accordance with the existing rules; it is the clerk of court who shall assume liability for any loss, shortage, damage or destruction of court records, exhibits and properties; Atty. Toledo miserably failed to establish a systematic and efficient documentation and record management in Branch 259 of the RTC of Parañaque City. (Id.)

Insubordination 
- Insubordination is defined as a refusal to obey some order, which a superior officer is entitled to give and have obeyed; the term imports an unwillingness to submit to authority and refusal to perform official duty; here, Clerk of Court Balisnomo was ordered by his superior Judge Espinosa to issue a writ of preliminary injunction in a case pending in their sala; Balisnomo, however, refused to follow the directive, insisting that pursuant to the 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court, he is only allowed to issue writs of execution and no other; on this score, Balisnomo overlooked the command under Chapter 7 that clerks of court should also "perform duties as may be assigned to him"; when Judge Espinosa ordered his Clerk of Court in the person of Balisnomo to issue a writ other than a writ of execution, Judge Espinosa was assigning an additional duty which Balisnomo ought to have obeyed; when Balisnomo deliberately disobeyed Judge Espinosa's orders, he committed an act of insubordination; Section 50 (D) of the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service classifies insubordination as a less grave offense punishable by suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense; and dismissal from service for the second offense; under Sections 48 and 49 of the same rules, in the determination of the penalties to be imposed, mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances attendant to the commission of the offense shall be considered; here, the penalty for insubordination is suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months; there being an aggravating circumstance of previous administrative liability i.e. found guilty of simple misconduct in A.M. No. P-16-3607, sans any offsetting mitigating circumstance, the Court deems it proper to impose on Balisnomo the maximum penalty of suspension for six (6) months without pay, with stern warning. (Espinosa vs. Balisnomo, Clerk of Court IV, Municipal Trial Court in Cities, Sipalay, Negros Occidental, A.M. No. P-20-4039 [Formerly OCA I.P.I. No. 18-4840-P], Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CODE OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY (CPR)

Canon 8 and Canon 11 
- The Court concurs with the findings of Commissioner Mamon that the language contained in Atty. Misa's counter-affidavit, making reference to the personal behavior and circumstances of Roselyn run afoul to the precepts of the Code of Professional Responsibility; in Gimeno v. Zaide, it was held that the prohibition on the use of intemperate, offensive, and abusive language in a lawyer's professional dealings, whether with the courts, his clients, or any other person, is based on the following canons and rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility: Canon 8 – A lawyer shall conduct himself with courtesy, fairness and candor toward his professional colleagues, and shall avoid harassing tactics against opposing counsel; Rule 8.01 – A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive or otherwise improper; Canon 11 – A lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should insist on similar conduct by others; Rule 11.03 – A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing language or behavior before the Courts; Roselyn was not even a party to the subject criminal case under investigation by Asst. Prosecutor Melanio E. Cordillo, Jr.; the statements made in the counter-affidavit that Roselyn was a known drug addict, a fraud, and making insinuation that her marriage was a "fixed marriage" were pointless and uncalled for, and thus only show that the clear intention of Atty. Misa was to humiliate or insult Roselyn; Atty. Misa violated the canons and rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility for his use of derogatory and defamatory language in his affidavit; "though a lawyer's language may be forceful and emphatic, it should always be dignified and respectful, befitting the dignity of the legal profession; the use of intemperate language and unkind ascriptions has no place in the dignity of judicial forum." (Parks vs. Atty. Misa, Jr., A.C. No. 11639, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### COMMON CARRIERS

Failure to register as a public vehicle or a common carrier 
- Article 1732 of the Civil Code defines common carriers as persons, corporations, firms or associations engaged in the business of carrying or transporting passengers or goods or both, by land, water, or air, for compensation, offering their services to the public; the Land Transportation and Traffic Code distinguished the classification of vehicles; the requirement for vehicles for hire to obtain a Certificate of Public Convenience from the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was emphasized in LTFRB Memorandum Circular Number 98-027; the Heirs of Catalina established through preponderance of evidence that, at the time of the incident, the vehicle was being used as a truck for hire without securing the necessary franchise from the LTFRB; ES Trucking engaged in a truck for hire business, offering their vehicles to transport the cargo of its customers; Ruste admitted that they filed an application to have the vehicle included in their Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) yet their application was never granted; this is inconsistent with his own claim that ES Trucking does not need to register with the LTFRB because it is not a common carrier but a private company; ES Trucking cannot be excused simply because it is not registered with the LTFRB and it is a private company; as an entity engaged in the truck for hire business, it should have complied with the requirements of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code and the issuances of the LTFRB; despite being registered as a private vehicle, the actual use of the vehicle and the clientele to whom ES Trucking offers its services remain controlling; the failure to register the vehicle as a public vehicle or a common carrier does not negate the true nature of the vehicle. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### COMPLAINT OR INFORMATION

Dismissal of 
- At the outset, the RTC based its order of dismissal on Section 3, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court; the provision contemplates certain instances where the complaint may be dismissed due to the plaintiff's fault: (1) if he or she fails to appear during a scheduled hearing, especially on the date for the presentation of his or her evidence in chief; (2) if he or she fails to prosecute his or her action for an unreasonable length of time; (3) if he or she fails to comply with the rules; or (4) if he or she fails to comply with any order of the court; thus, failure on the part of the plaintiff, without any justifiable cause, to comply with any order of the court may result in the dismissal of the complaint either motu proprio or on motion by the defendant. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)

Filing of 
- In Crespo v. Mogul, the Supreme Court held that once a complaint or information is already filed in court, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court; it is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it; thus, when a motion to dismiss the case is filed by the public prosecutor, it should be addressed to the court who has the option to grant or deny the same; the court should be mindful not to infringe on the substantial rights of the accused or the right of the People to due process of law; in Santos v. Orda, Jr., this Court emphasized that the above rule likewise applies to a motion to withdraw Information or to dismiss the case filed before the court, like in the case at bar, even before or after arraignment of the accused; the grant or denial of the same is left to the trial court's exclusive judicial discretion; hence, it should not merely rely on the findings of the public prosecutor or the Secretary of Justice that no crime was committed or that the evidence in the possession of the public prosecutor is insufficient to support a judgment of conviction of the accused; instead, the trial court has to make its own independent assessment of the merits of the case as well as the evidence of the prosecution. (Social Security System vs. Seno, Jr., et al., G.R. 183478, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### COMPLEX CRIMES

Commission of 
- The final amendment to the Informations charged accused-appellants of the complex crime of arbitrary detention with murder; however, evidence failed to show that the incidents made out a case of complex crime under Article 48 of the RPC; first, the single act of accused-appellants did not constitute two or more grave or less grave felonies; second, arbitrary detention was not used as a necessary means to commit murder; in various cases such as People of the Philippines v. Li Wai Cheung and People of the Philippines v. Araneta, the Court convicted the accused for the separate crimes even if they were indicted of a complex crime in the Information because it was improper for the prosecutor to have charged them of a complex crime as the offenses were separate and distinct from each other and cannot be complexed; in examining the events that transpired prior to the killing of the three, it was not proved that their arbitrary detention was used as a means of killing them; when the three were abducted and placed in the custody of accused-appellants, the felony of arbitrary detention had already been consummated; thereafter, when they were boxed, kicked, pistol-whipped and ultimately shot at a close range while being handcuffed and without means to defend themselves, another separate crime of murder was committed. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002 (R.A. 9165)

Chain of custody rule 
- Admittedly, strict compliance with the requirements of law may not always be possible and the failure of the apprehending team to strictly comply with the procedure laid out in Section 21 of R.A. 9165 does not ipso facto render the seizure and custody over the items void, this has always been with the caveat that the prosecution still needs to satisfactorily prove that: (a) there is justifiable ground for non-compliance; and (b) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved; "it is well-settled that the procedure in Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 is a matter of substantive law, and cannot be brushed aside as a simple procedural technicality; or worse, ignored as an impediment to the conviction of illegal drug suspects"; any breach in the procedure laid down in our laws has the effect of compromising the integrity and evidentiary value of the very corpus delicti of the case and thereby militates against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt against the accused. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- After the marking and inventory of the seized items, City Jail Warden Superintendent Enriquez signed the referral letter to the PDEA Laboratory Service Unit; although Superintendent Enriquez was not presented in court, this does not necessarily cast doubt on the integrity of the seized items; for not all people who came into contact with the seized drugs are required to testify in court; there is nothing in the law or in any rule implementing the same which imposes such requirement; of utmost importance is the fact that the chain of custody of the seized drug was clearly shown to have remained unbroken. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)


- As culled from the records and highlighted by the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses themselves, only one of the required witnesses was present during the inventory stage - the barangay captain of Ungot; the failure of the police officers to provide a reasonable excuse or justification for the absence of the other witnesses clearly magnified the lack of concrete effort on their part to comply with the requirements of Section 21; the absence of these witnesses constitutes a substantial gap in the chain of custody and raises doubts on the integrity and evidentiary value of the items that were allegedly seized from the petitioner; it militates against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the law deserves faithful compliance, especially by the police officers who ought to have known the proper procedure in the seizure and handling of the confiscated items, especially since the small volume of the suspected drugs made it easier for the items to be corrupted or tampered with; it is only for justifiable and unavoidable grounds that deviations from the required procedure is excused; the Court finds the errors committed by the apprehending team as sufficient to cast serious doubts on the guilt of the petitioner; absent faithful compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 which is primarily intended to, first, preserve the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items in drugs cases, and second, to safeguard accused persons from unfounded and unjust convictions, an acquittal becomes the proper recourse. (Tolentino vs. People, G.R. 227217, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Chain of custody means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction; such record of movements and custody of the seized item shall include the identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody were made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final disposition; Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 requires the apprehending team, after seizure and confiscation, to immediately conduct a physical inventory and photograph the same in the presence of (1) the accused or the persons from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel; (2) a representative from the media and (3) the DOJ; and (4) any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; a plain reading of the law shows that it applies as long as there has been a seizure and confiscation of drugs; nothing in the statutory provision states that it is only applicable when there is a warrantless seizure in a buy-bust operation; thus, it should be applied in every situation when an apprehending team seizes and confiscates drugs from an accused, whether through a buy-bust operation or through a search warrant. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In prosecution of drug-related cases, the State bears not only the burden of proving these elements, but also of proving the corpus delicti or the body of the crime; the dangerous drug itself is the very corpus delicti of the violation of the law; therefore, compliance with the chain of custody rule is crucial; chain of custody means the duly recorded authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction; the rule is imperative, as it is essential that the prohibited drug confiscated or recovered from the suspect is the very same substance offered in court as exhibit; and that the identity of said drug is established with the same unwavering exactitude as that requisite to make a finding of guilt; thus, strict compliance with the procedures laid down under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is required to ensure that rights are safeguarded; it requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed immediately after seizure or confiscation; and (2) that the physical inventory and photographing must be done in the presence of (a) the accused or his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the Department of Justice, all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In the prosecution of drugs cases, the procedural safeguards that are embodied in Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. 10640, are material, as their compliance affects the corpus delicti which is the dangerous drug itself and warrants the identity and integrity of the substances and other evidence that are seized by the apprehending officers; the amendment that was introduced by R.A. 10640 in Section 21 prescribes a physical inventory and photograph of the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, plus two other witnesses, particularly, (1) an elected public official, and (2) a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media, who shall sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; proponents of the amendment recognized that the strict implementation of the original Section 21 of R.A. 9165 could be impracticable for the law enforcers' compliance, and that the stringent requirements could unduly hamper their activities towards drug eradication; the amendment then substantially included the saving clause that was actually already in the IRR of the former Section 21, indicating that non-compliance with the law's requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid seizures and custody over confiscated items; a failure to fully satisfy the requirements under Section 21 must be strictly premised on "justifiable grounds"; the primary rule that commands a satisfaction of the instructions prescribed by the statute stands; the value of the rule is significant; its non-compliance has serious effects and is fatal to the prosecution's case. (Tolentino vs. People, G.R. 227217, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Links that the prosecution must prove to establish chain of custody: first, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court; as a method of authenticating evidence, the chain of custody rule requires that the admission of the exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be; it would thus include testimony about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was seized to the time it is offered in court as evidence, such that every person who handled the same would admit how and from whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while in the witness' possession, the condition in which it was received and the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain; the prosecution's failure to present evidence showing the manner in which the illegal drug subject of this case was handled, stored and safeguarded pending its presentation in court is fatal to its case. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 was originally envisioned by the legislature to serve as a protection for the accused from malicious imputations of guilt by abusive police officers; the illegal drugs being the corpus delicti, it is essential for the prosecution to prove and show to the court beyond reasonable doubt that the illegal drugs presented to it as evidence of the crime are indeed the illegal drugs seized from the accused; by its very nature, Sec. 21 demands strict compliance; compliance cannot give way to a facsimile; otherwise, the purpose of guarding against tampering, substitution, and planting of evidence is defeated; proof that strict compliance is imperative is how jurisprudence disapproves of the approximation of compliance; the ultimate purpose of Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 is to prevent the tampering, alteration, and substitution of the seized drugs, which are not readily identifiable, and to serve as a protection against abusive police officers; the evil sought to be prevented by Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 exists both in the implementation of a search warrant and in the conduct of a buy-bust operation; in both cases, the law requires that the identity and integrity of the confiscated items be maintained so as to prevent the malicious practice of police officers in tampering, altering, and substituting the said items; thus, the chain of custody rule under Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165, including the mandatory witnesses during the physical inventory and taking of photographs of the seized drugs, must be applied when there is a confiscation of purported drugs in the implementation of a search warrant. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 outlines the procedure that police officers must follow in handling the confiscated drugs in order to ensure that their integrity and evidentiary value are preserved; the law requires that the inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if prior to the amendment of R.A. 9165 by R.A. 10640, "a representative from the media and the DOJ, and any elected public official"; or (b) if after the amendment of R.A. 9165 by R.A. 10640, "an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the media." (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The fourth link in the chain of custody refers to the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court; there was a slight discrepancy in the weight of the seized item stated in Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DD016-092 and the actual weight during ocular inspection; per Chemistry Report No. PDEA-DD016-092, the net weight of the seized item was 735.8 grams; during the ocular inspection, however, the weight increased to 747.8 grams or an increase of twelve (12) grams; in People v. Aneslag, et al., the Court found no cause to acquit the accused by reason alone of the variance in the weight of the shabu as alleged in the information (240 grams) on one hand, and as determined by the forensic chemist (210 grams) on the other; the Court noted that the variance may be explained by the following circumstances: (1) the subject shabu packs were twice tested by two (2) different forensic chemists in order to expedite the proceedings per order of the trial court so that representative samples of the shabu were taken from the aforesaid packs by the first forensic chemist (P/Sr. Insp. Mag-abo) which could have affected the total weight as subsequently determined by the second forensic chemist (P/Sr. Insp. Bernido); and (2) P/Sr. Insp. Bernido testified that when she weighed each pack of shabu, the same was done without the packaging material thereof which could have, likewise, affected the total weight of the shabu. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Under the law, a physical inventory and photograph of the items that were purportedly seized from the accused should have been made at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable; the entire procedure must likewise be made in the presence of the accused or his representative or counsel and three witnesses, namely: (1) an elected public official; (2) a representative from the DOJ; AND (3) a representative from the media; these individuals shall then be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (Tolentino vs. People, G.R. 227217, Feb. 12, 2020)

Illegal possession of dangerous drugs 
- Aside from recognizing the procedural lapses and providing a justifiable ground for the noncompliance, it is also required that the prosecution establish that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved in order to substantially comply with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165; here, it is evident that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items were not preserved; there was no evidence presented on how the seized items were secured upon confiscation; it is not even clear who safeguarded the seized items from the time of confiscation up to its transfer to the investigating officer and until it reached the laboratory for examination; due to the prosecution's failure to prove that the integrity and evidentiary value of the corpus delicti were preserved, petitioner cannot be convicted of the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- For a successful prosecution of an offense for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following elements: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug; this crime is mala prohibita, as such, criminal intent is not an essential element; the prosecution, however, must prove that the accused had the intent to possess (animus possidendi). (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

Illegal sale and illegal possession of prohibited drugs 
- Fulgado stands charged with selling 0.02 gram of shabu and possessing 0.02 gram of shabu; for the successful prosecution of illegal sale of prohibited drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the following elements must be established beyond reasonable doubt, to wit: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; on the other hand, in order to secure conviction for illegal possession of prohibited drugs under Section 11, Article II of R.A. 9165 the prosecution must prove: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the drug; in both cases, the existence of the drug – being the corpus delicti of the crimes – must be clearly established by the prosecution; corollarily, the prosecution has the burden of proving that there was no interruption in the chain of custody of the dangerous drugs, from the moment the drugs were seized up to their presentation in court. (People vs. Fulgado @ "Thane," G.R. 246193, Feb. 19, 2020)

Illegal sale of dangerous drugs 
- In actions involving the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following elements: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment; it is equally essential for a conviction that the drug subject of the sale be presented in court and its identity established with moral certainty through an unbroken chain of custody over it; the prosecution must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the dangerous drug from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the corpus delicti. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In order to convict a person charged with the crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the prosecution is required to prove the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In order to sustain a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs, defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the law demands the establishment of the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor; what is important is that the sale transaction of drugs actually took place and that the object of the transaction is properly presented as evidence in court and is shown to be the same drugs seized from the accused. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

Non-compliance with the chain of custody rule 
- As field conditions vary and strict compliance with the rule may not always be possible, Section 21 of the IRR of R.A. 9165 provides a saving clause; noncompliance with the requirements of Section 21 will not automatically render void and invalid the seizure and custody over the seized items, so long as: 1) there are justifiable grounds therefor, and 2) the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer or team; failure to show these two conditions renders void and invalid the seizure of and custody of the seized illegal drugs; here, the inventory and taking of photographs of the seized illegal drug were witnessed by accused-appellants and Barangay Kagawad Ayson; there were no representatives from the media and the DOJ present at the time; since this is a deviation from the requirements of Section 21, it is incumbent upon the prosecution to provide justifiable reasons in order for the saving clause to apply; the prosecution failed to recognize its procedural lapse and provided no such explanation whatsoever other than that the police officers "cannot avail" of the presence of the required witnesses; these reasons must be proven as a fact because the Court cannot presume what these grounds are or that they even exist; not only did the prosecution fail to provide justifiable reasons for the absence of the required witnesses during the inventory and taking of photographs of the evidence, it also failed to show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item were properly preserved. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Here, the physical inventory and photograph of the seized item were not done at the place of the arrest but only at the police station; there was no showing by the prosecution that these were done due to extraordinary circumstances that would threaten the safety and security of the apprehending officers and/or the witnesses required by law or of the items seized; moreover, the absence of the witnesses required by law – an elected public official, representative of the DOJ and the media 
- to witness the physical inventory and photograph of the seized items is glaring; their signatures do not appear in the Inventory Receipt; in People v. Vicente Sipin: The prosecution bears the burden of proving a valid cause for noncompliance with the procedure laid down in Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended; it has the positive duty to demonstrate observance thereto in such a way that during the trial proceedings, it must initiate in acknowledging and justifying any perceived deviations from the requirements of law; its failure to follow the mandated procedure must be adequately explained, and must be proven as a fact in accordance with the rules on evidence; the rules require that the apprehending officers do not simply mention a justifiable ground, but also clearly state this ground in their sworn affidavit, coupled with a statement on the steps they took to preserve the integrity of the seized items; strict adherence to Section 21 is required where the quantity of illegal drugs seized is miniscule. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The Court is well aware that a perfect chain of custody is almost always impossible to achieve and so it has previously ruled that minor lapses or deviations from the prescribed procedure are excused so long as it can be shown by the prosecution that the arresting officers put in their best effort to comply with the same and the justifiable ground for non-compliance is proven as a fact; in the recent case of People of the Philippines v. Lim, the Court reiterated that testimonies of the prosecution witnesses must establish in detail that earnest effort to coordinate with and secure the presence of the required witnesses was made; in addition, it pointed out that given the increasing number of poorly built up drug-related cases in the courts' docket, Section 1 (A.1.10) of the Chain of Custody IRR should be enforced as a mandatory policy. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)


- The police officers in this case committed several violations of Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165; first, the required witnesses under Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 were not present; second, the seized items were not photographed by the police officers; the records are bereft of any photographs of the said items; third, neither can the prosecution apply the saving clause under Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165; the prosecution failed to give any justifiable ground for the noncompliance with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

Procedural safeguards in Section 21 
- In the prosecution of drugs cases, the procedural safeguards that are embodied in Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. No.10640, are material as their compliance affects the corpus delicti which is the dangerous drug itself and warrants the identity and integrity of the substances and other evidence that are seized by the apprehending officers; the amendment that was introduced by R.A. 10640 in Section 21 prescribes a physical inventory and photograph of the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, plus two other witnesses, particularly: (1) an elected public official, and (2) a representative of the National Prosecution Service (Department of Justice) or the media, who shall sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; proponents of the amendment recognized that the strict implementation of the original Section 21 of R.A. 9165 could be impracticable for the law enforcers' compliance, and that the stringent requirements could unduly hamper their activities towards drug eradication; the amendment then substantially included the saving clause that was actually already in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the former Section 21, indicating that non-compliance with the law's requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/ team, shall not render void and invalid seizures and custody over confiscated items. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)


- Since the offense subject of this appeal was committed before the amendment introduced by R.A. 10640, the old provisions of Section 21 and its IRR should apply; under the law, a physical inventory and photograph of the items that were purportedly seized from the accused should have been made at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable; the entire procedure must, likewise, be made in the presence of the accused or his representative or counsel and three witnesses, namely: (1) an elected public official; (2) a representative from the DOJ; and (3) a representative from the media; these individuals shall then be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; here, as culled from the records and highlighted by the testimonies of the police officers themselves, none of the required witnesses was present during the inventory stage; neither was it shown nor alleged by the police officers that earnest efforts were made to secure the attendance of these witnesses. (Id.)

Saving clause 
- Sec. 21 and its IRR provide for a saving clause in case of noncompliance with the chain of custody rule; this saving clause applies only (1) where the prosecution recognized the procedural lapses, and thereafter explained the cited justifiable grounds, and (2) when the prosecution established that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized had been preserved; the prosecution, thus, loses the benefit of invoking the presumption of regularity and bears the burden of proving – with moral certainty – that the illegal drug presented in court is the same drug that was confiscated from the accused during his arrest; again, this saving clause does not distinguish between cases with a search warrant and a buy-bust operation; whether drugs were seized in a buy-bust operation or in the implementation of the search warrant, the prosecution can invoke the saving clause provided that there is justifiable reason for noncompliance with the procedural lapses and the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized drugs are established. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

Seizure and marking 
- The first link in the chain of custody refers to the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officers; the marking of the seized drug is crucial in establishing an unbroken chain of custody because succeeding handlers of the dangerous drugs or related items will use the marking as reference; it serves to separate the marked evidence from the corpus of all other similar or related evidence from the time they are seized until disposal at the end of the criminal proceedings, thus preventing switching, "planting," or contamination of evidence; in other words, the immediate marking is indispensable in the preservation of the seized items' integrity and evidentiary value; JO2 Briones did the marking and inventory of the seized items in the Manila City Jail where Tulipat got arrested; the light violet bag was marked "ACD/4/28/16," the blue sando bag "ACB/1/4-28-16" and the self-sealing transparent bag "ACB-2/4-28-16"; on the other hand, JO3 Rodzon Antonio photographed these items. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

Venue of physical inventory and taking of photographs of the seized drugs —The only recognizable difference between seizure and confiscation of drugs pursuant to a search warrant and a buy-bust operation is the venue of the physical inventory and taking of photographs of the said drugs; in People v. Lazaro, the Court explained that the venue of physical inventory is not limited to the place of apprehension; the venues of the physical inventory and photography of the seized items differ and depend on whether the seizure was made by virtue of a search warrant or through a warrantless seizure such as a buy-bust operation; when the drugs are seized pursuant to a search warrant, then the physical inventory and taking of photographs shall be conducted at the place where the said search warrant was served; in contrast, when the drugs are seized pursuant to a buy-bust operation or a warrantless seizure, then these can be conducted at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending team; other than that, there is no other difference between seizure and confiscation of drugs with a search warrant and without it (such as a buy-bust operation); consistent with Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165, its IRR does not suspend the application of the chain of custody rule simply because the drugs were seized pursuant to a search warrant; thus, the witnesses under the law are required to be present. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

Witnesses requirement 
- Earnest effort to secure the attendance of the necessary witnesses must be proven; People v. Ramos requires: It is well to note that the absence of these required witnesses does not per se render the confiscated items inadmissible; however, a justifiable reason for such failure or a showing of any genuine and sufficient effort to secure the required witnesses under Section 21 of R.A. 9165 must be adduced; the prosecution miserably failed to explain why the police officers did not secure the presence of an elected public official, a representative from the DOJ, and the media; the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses also failed to establish that there was earnest effort to coordinate with and secure the presence of the required witnesses. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In People v. Reyes, the Court enumerated certain instances when absence of the required witnesses may be justified, viz.: It must be emphasized that the prosecution must be able to prove a justifiable ground in omitting certain requirements provided in Sec. 21 such as, but not limited to the following: (1) media representatives are not available at the time or that the police operatives had no time to alert the media due to the immediacy of the operation they were about to undertake, especially if it is done in more remote areas; (2) the police operatives, with the same reason, failed to find an available representative of the National Prosecution Service; (3) the police officers, due to time constraints brought about by the urgency of the operation to be undertaken and in order to comply with the provisions of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code in the timely delivery of prisoners, were not able to comply with all the requisites set forth in Section 21 of R.A. 9165. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)


- It must be alleged and proved that the presence of the three witnesses to the physical inventory and photograph of the illegal drug seized was not obtained due to reason/s such as: (1) their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area; (2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media representative and an elected public official within the period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or (5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations, which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required witnesses even before the offenders could escape. (People vs. Padua a.k.a. Jerick Padua, G.R. 239781, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Section 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that only two (2) witnesses are required to be present during the implementation of a search warrant; nevertheless, Sec. 8 of Rule 126 is a general provision with respect to the implementation of search warrants in all kinds of cases, such as for illegal firearms, infringing goods, or incriminating documents; on the other hand, Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended, and as implemented by its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), is a special provision that applies specifically to the seizure and confiscation of dangerous drugs; in case of conflict between a general law and a special law, the latter must prevail regardless of the dates of their enactment; thus, it has been held that 
- the fact that one law is special and the other general creates a presumption that the special act is to be considered as remaining an exception of the general act, one as a general law of the land and the other as the law of the particular case; further, Sec. 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is not even a substantive law; rather, it is a mere remedial provision; in determining whether a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the practice and procedure of the lower courts, abridges, enlarges, or modifies any substantive right, the test is whether the rule really regulates procedure, that is, the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for a disregard or infraction of them; if the rule takes away a vested right, it is not procedural; if the rule creates a right such as the right to appeal, it may be classified as a substantive matter; but if it operates as a means of implementing an existing right then the rule deals merely with procedure; here, Congress enacted Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 to ensure the identity and integrity of the seized drugs and to prevent tampering thereof; as stated in People v. Acub, in all prosecutions for violations of R.A. 9165, the corpus delicti is the dangerous drug itself; its existence is essential to a judgment of conviction; hence, the identity of the dangerous drug must be clearly established; narcotic substances are not readily identifiable; to determine their composition and nature, they must undergo scientific testing and analysis; they are also highly susceptible to alteration, tampering, or contamination; it is imperative, therefore, that the drugs allegedly seized from the accused are the very same objects tested in the laboratory and offered in court as evidence; the chain of custody, as a method of authentication, ensures that unnecessary doubts involving the identity of seized drugs are removed; in the special cases of seizure of drugs, the statutory provision of Sec. 21 of R.A. 9165 should apply and must take precedence in contrast to the general remedial provision of Sec. 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The failure of the police officers to provide a reasonable excuse or justification for the absence of these witnesses clearly magnified the lack of concrete effort on their part to comply with the requirements of Section 21; the absence of these witnesses constitutes a substantial gap in the chain of custody and raises doubts on the integrity and evidentiary value of the items that were allegedly seized from the accused-appellant; it militates against a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the law deserves faithful compliance, especially by the police officers who ought to have known the proper procedure in the seizure and handling of the confiscated items, especially since the small volume of the suspected drugs made it easier for the items to be corrupted or tampered with. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

#### COMPROMISE JUDGMENT

Concept 
- The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board concluded that it was petitioners, not respondents, who refused to comply with the Compromise Agreement by allegedly refusing to pay their tenurial dues 
- an obligation not actually stipulated in the Compromise Agreement; in Viesca v. Gilinsky: It is settled that neither the courts nor quasi-judicial bodies can impose upon the parties a judgment different from their compromise agreement or against the very terms and conditions of their agreement without contravening the universally established principle that a contract is the law between the parties; the courts can only approve the agreement of parties; they cannot make a contract for them. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### CONSPIRACY

Existence of 
- The Court disagrees with the CA's findings that conspiracy was sufficiently established; the pronouncements of the Court in PNP-CIDG v. Villafuerte, a case involving the same factual backdrop, find full application in the instant case, to wit: It bears stressing that while the Office of the Ombudsman's factual findings in their entirety tend to demonstrate a sequence of irregularities in the procurement of the LPOHs, this does not ipso facto translate into a conspiracy between each and every person involved in the procurement process; for conspiracy to be appreciated, it must be clearly shown that there was a conscious design to commit an offense; conspiracy is not the product of negligence but of intentionality on the part of cohorts; conspiracy is never presumed; there is a sheer dearth of evidence on Lukban's participation in the alleged conspiracy to defraud the government. (Lukban vs. Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, G.R. 238563, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ARBITRATION COMMISSION (CIAC)

Jurisdiction 
- Provisions of law which define the jurisdiction of a quasi-judicial agency "must be viewed in the light of the nature and function" of the particular agency whose jurisdiction is sought to be invoked; thus, the jurisdiction of the CIAC must also be viewed in the light of the legislative rationale behind the tribunal's creation; it is glaringly apparent from the whereas clauses of E.O. No. 1008, and Section 2 thereof that the CIAC was established to serve as a tribunal which will expeditiously resolve disputes within the construction industry; the CIAC was formed to resolve disputes involving transactions and business relationships within the construction industry; it is for this reason that Section 4 prescribes that the CIAC shall only have jurisdiction over "disputes arising from, or connected with, contracts entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines"; the foregoing phrase limits the jurisdiction of the CIAC not only as to subject matter jurisdiction but also as to jurisdiction over the parties; thus, the CIAC can acquire jurisdiction if the dispute arises from or is connected with the construction industry, both parties to such dispute are involved in construction in the Philippines, and they agree to submit their dispute to arbitration. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Respondent Vilvar, citing Sections 35 and 21 of the R.A. 9285 asserts that CIAC jurisdiction is not limited to contractual relations; however, it has already been demonstrated that the presence of a construction contract is an essential requisite for the CIAC to acquire jurisdiction; while it is indeed true that Sections 35 and 21 of the ADR Law confirm CIAC jurisdiction over construction disputes regardless of whether or not they arise from a contract, it must be noted that Section 21 only contemplates "matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature"; therefore, while CIAC may have jurisdiction over non-contractual disputes (for instance, a tortious breach of contract), these disputes must still arise from or be connected with a construction contract entered into by parties in the Philippines who agree to submit such disputes to arbitration, which is not the case here; the relationship between the parties in this case can hardly be considered commercial in nature; commercial acts have been defined as those acts "which tend to the satisfaction of necessities by means of exchange or of the rendition of services, effected with a purpose of gain"; the only relation between the spouses Ang and respondent Caramats is that they are adjoining lot owners; and the spouses do not even have any relation at all to respondents Soto and Vilvar, other than that involving the alleged damage to the Ang residence; the only nexus between the spouses Ang and the respondents in this case is spatial in nature, and this relation is not enough to vest jurisdiction in the CIAC. (Id.)


- The jurisdiction of the CIAC is provided in Section 4 of E.O. No. 1008, or the Construction Industry Arbitration Law; this provision lays down three requisites for acquisition of jurisdiction by the CIAC, first: a dispute arising from or connected with a construction contract; second, such contract must have been entered into by parties involved in construction in the Philippines; and third, an agreement by the parties to submit their dispute to arbitration; given the allegations in the spouses Ang's complaint and the issues raised in their petition before this Court, the foregoing requisites obviously do not apply to the case at bar; the spouses' cause of action does not proceed from any construction contract or any accessory contract thereto but from the alleged damage inflicted upon their property by virtue of respondents' construction activities. (Id.)

#### CONTRACTS

Annulment of 
- Article 1397 of the Civil Code provides that "persons who are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted"; even if they were, they still filed the wrong action; the contracting party's incapacity is a ground for annulment of contract, not rescission; petitioners pray for the rescission of the contract, but the ground they raised is one for annulment of contract; Article 1397 of the Civil Code specifies who may institute such action: ARTICLE 1397. The action for the annulment of contracts may be instituted by all who are thereby obliged principally or subsidiarily; however, persons who are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom they contracted; nor can those who exerted intimidation, violence, or undue influence, or employed fraud, or caused mistake base their action upon these flaws of the contract; even if this Court were to consider petitioners' action as one for annulment of contract, they are still not the proper parties to file such action; they are not parties to the Deed of Absolute Sale, and neither are they obliged principally or subsidiarily with regard to the Deed of Absolute Sale; the trial court's dismissal of their Complaint would still be proper. (Mañas, joined by wife Lena Isabelle Y. Mañas vs. Roca, et al., G.R. 208845, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### COURT PERSONNEL

Conduct 
- Ancheta's acts seriously undermined the trust and confidence of the public in the entire Judiciary; he ought to protect the image of the Judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, especially that it has been the source of his bread and butter for almost forty (40) years; his acts created the impression to the mind of the public that instead of being a bastion of justice, the Judiciary has become a haven of corruption; his explanation that he was merely motivated by his desire to help someone seeking justice, which according to him is one of the pillars of Christianity, and he did not obtain financial gain for his participation, cannot absolve him from administrative liability; Ancheta's concept of helping someone in this particular instance is skewed in that it corrupted an officer of the court who, among others, was unfortunately quick to forget his Code of Professional Responsibility and his Oath as a lawyer for allowing himself to be drawn by the glitter of money; his insistence that he did not gain any financial reward from the transactions is immaterial; in administrative cases, the issue is whether or not the employee has breached the norms and standards of service, as in this case. (Re: Investigation and Report Concerning Samuel Ancheta Jr., Records Officer III, et al. vs. Atty. Corro, et al., A.M. No. 2019-17-SC, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility; conduct at all times must not only be characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above suspicion; Atty. Toledo was appointed Clerk of Court of Branch 259 in 1996 while Barcelona was transferred to said court as clerk in 1994; Branch 259 was already designated as a special court for heinous crimes; in 2000, it was designated as a special court for drug cases; they were well-aware of the degree of responsibility imposed upon them as evidence custodians and the efficiency expected of them in the reception and storage of evidence considering the nature of the cases that Branch 259 handles; Office of the Court Administrator v. Cabe and Mendoza v. Mabutas, cited. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)


- The image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of its personnel; all court personnel are mandated to adhere to the strictest standards of honesty, integrity, morality, and decency in both their professional and personal conduct; in order to preserve the good name and integrity of the courts of justice, they must exemplify the highest sense of honesty and integrity not only in the performance of their official duties but also in their private dealings with other people; public service demands the highest level of honesty and transparency from its officers and employees; the Constitution requires that all public officers and employees be, at all times, accountable to the people, serve with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency; act with patriotism and justice; and lead modest public lives. (Re: Investigation and Report Concerning Samuel Ancheta Jr., Records Officer III, et al. vs. Atty. Corro, et al., A.M. No. 2019-17-SC, Feb. 18, 2020)

Grave misconduct 
- Ancheta has been with the Court for thirty-eight (38) long years; his mother served the Court for almost forty (40) years and was awarded as a model employee; it is thus lamentable that he not only failed to emulate the exemplary service his mother dedicated to the Court, but likewise failed to meet the basic standards of propriety, honesty and fairness exacted from all government employees; parenthetically, his years of service in the Court cannot serve to mitigate his offense, but has to be appreciated as aggravating; length of service can either be a mitigating or an aggravating circumstance depending on the facts of each case; it is usually considered as an aggravating circumstance when the offense committed is serious or grave or if length of service is a factor that facilitates the commission of the offense, as in this case. (Re: Investigation and Report Concerning Samuel Ancheta Jr., Records Officer III, et al. vs. Atty. Corro, et al., A.M. No. 2019-17-SC, Feb. 18, 2020)


- Grave misconduct is classified as a grave offense for which the penalty of dismissal is meted even, as in this case, for the first time offenders; defined as the transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer coupled with the elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules; corruption, as an element of grave misconduct, consists in the official or employee's act of unlawfully or wrongfully using his position to gain benefit for one's self. (Id.)

Gross neglect of duty 
- In 2008, Atty. Toledo had been administratively charged for violation of the lawyer's oath, violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility, oppression, dishonesty, harassment, and immorality in A.M. No. P-07-2403 where the OCA recommended his suspension for a period of three (3) months for conduct unbecoming a public official and a court employee; although the Court dismissed the complaint, it reminded Atty. Toledo to be more circumspect in his public and private dealings; he apparently disregarded the Court's warning and continued to show lack of diligence in his administrative function, completely unmindful of the heavy burden and responsibility he carries in the dispensation of justice; Atty. Toledo and Barcelona found liable for gross neglect of duty which merits the penalty of dismissal from the service even if the offense was committed for the first time under the Revised Rules of Administrative Cases in the Civil Service. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)


- The ocular inspection was conducted and the drug evidence were discovered missing on November 11, 2003; the RTC Decision in Criminal Case No. 01-1229 was rendered on November 10, 2003 while the decision in Criminal Case No. 03-0408 was promulgated on December 22, 2003; because of Barcelona's and Atty. Toledo's display of laxity in the custody of evidence, the corpora delicti in these two criminal cases vanished even before the actions were terminated; their inexcusable lapses in the safekeeping of the drug evidence constitute flagrant and palpable breach tantamount to gross neglect of duty as they undermine the integrity of the decisions rendered in the criminal cases. (Id.)

Simple neglect of duty and gross neglect of duty 
- The Court agrees with the findings of the OCA that Atty. Toledo and Barcelona have both been negligent in the performance of their duty to safely keep the physical evidence in the court's custody; we find them guilty of gross neglect of duty and not merely simple neglect of duty; Simple neglect of duty is defined as "the failure to give proper attention to a task expected of an employee resulting from either carelessness or indifference"; however, when an employee's negligence displays want of even the slightest care or conscious indifference to the consequences or by flagrant and palpable breach of duty, the omission is regarded as gross neglect of duty; there is gross neglect of duty when a public official or employee's negligence is characterized by the glaring want of care, or by acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently, but willfully and intentionally, with a conscious indifference to the consequences, insofar as other persons may be affected. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)

#### COURTS

Construction disputes 
- OCA Circular No. 111-2014 reiterates an earlier circular which directs all courts to dismiss all construction disputes pending with their salas; it is clear that OCA Circular No. 111-2014 does not operate to ipso facto dismiss all construction disputes pending before the regional trial courts; but instead directs all presiding judges to issue orders dismissing such suits. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)

Hierarchy of courts 
- There are serious and compelling reasons to warrant direct resort to the Court; considering that what is invoked here is the constitutionality of DOJ Circular No. 27 that continues to be implemented in the prosecution of cases involving dangerous drugs, Sayre is justified in seeking the immediate action of the Court; the outcome of the present petition will certainly affect hundreds of on-going plea bargaining in dangerous drugs cases. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)


- With the enactment of R.A. 9282 on March 30, 2004, the CTA was elevated to a collegiate court with special jurisdiction and of the same level as the Court of Appeals; in the same way, when it was first created by virtue of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1486 on June 11, 1978, the Sandiganbayan was a special court of equal rank as the CFIs; P.D. No. 1606 was issued shortly thereafter on December 10, 1978 which declared the Sandiganbayan as a special court of the same level as the Court of Appeals; the aforequoted statutory provisions expressly state that the Presiding Justices and Associate Justices of the CTA and the Sandiganbayan shall have the same rank, salary, privileges, and emoluments; be subject to the same inhibitions and disqualifications; and enjoy the same retirement and other benefits provided under existing laws as the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals; they additionally prescribe that any increase in the salaries of the Presiding Justice and Associate Justices of the Court of Appeals shall be extended to and enjoyed by the Presiding Justices and Associate Justices of the CTA and the Sandiganbayan. (Re: Expenses of Retirement of Court of Appeals Justices, A.M. No. 19-02-03-CA, Feb. 11, 2020)

Inherent powers 
- Both law and jurisprudence grant unto Her Honor the power to reverse her original ruling, where necessary to avoid a miscarriage of justice; the power to amend and control its process and orders is an inherent power of the court, pursuant to Section 5(g) of Rule 135 of the Rules of Court; the inherent powers of a court to amend and control its processes and orders so as to make them conformable to law and justice include the court's right and power to reverse itself, especially when in its honest opinion, it has committed error or mistake in judgment, and where to adhere to the decision will cause injustice or injury to a party litigant. (Domingo vs. Macapagal, G.R. 242577, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Variance rule 
- As a rule, an accused can only be convicted of the crime with which he or she is charged; this rule proceeds from the constitutional guarantee that an accused shall always be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him or her; an exception to this is the rule on variance under Section 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court; the due recognition of the constitutional right of an accused to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation through the criminal complaint or information is decisive of whether his or her prosecution for a crime stands or not; the right is not transgressed if the information sufficiently alleges facts and omissions constituting an offense that includes the offense established to have been committed by the accused, as in his case. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### CRUELTY

As an aggravating circumstance 
- Cruelty was correctly appreciated for the three killings as it was established that they were kicked, boxed, and pistol-whipped before having been killed; such acts constitute deliberate augmentation of a wrong by causing another wrong not necessary for its commission. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### DAMAGES

Actual damages 
- Under the Civil Code, when an injury has been sustained, actual damages may be awarded; only the expenses proven by credible evidence may be awarded; the funeral and burial expenses were duly supported with official receipts when presented in the RTC. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

Exemplary damages 
- Awarded upon finding that ES Trucking acted with gross negligence for failing to duly register the prime mover truck with the appropriate government agency, and for failing to impose a stringent selection procedure in hiring and supervising Timtim; the award of exemplary damages is justified further by ES Trucking's wanton disregard of the law and evident bad faith through its highly reprehensible conduct of altering the body number of the prime mover truck to avoid detection, in violation of its undertaking to preserve the original state of the vehicle while the case is pending; ES Trucking is directed to pay P50,000.00 as exemplary damages to the Heirs of Catalina. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Exemplary damages may be awarded if the dismissal was effected in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner; the person claiming damages must prove the existence of bad faith by clear and convincing evidence, for the law always presumes good faith; Roxas failed to establish that respondents were motivated by ill will or that his dismissal was done in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

Modification of award of damages 
- Modification of the award of damages is in order; still following People v. Tulagan, a person found guilty of rape by sexual assault of a child less than 12 years of age must compensate the latter with civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000.00 each; this Court likewise leaves undisturbed the initial grant of actual damages for medicine expenses and moral damages and impose only the additional awards of civil indemnity and exemplary damages at P50,000.00 each. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The Court of Appeals' imposition of monetary liability on accused-appellant must be modified; People v. Jugueta provides: When the circumstances surrounding the crime call for the imposition of reclusion perpetua only, there being no ordinary aggravating circumstance, the Court rules that the proper amounts should be P75,000.00 as civil indemnity, P75,000.00 as moral damages and P75,000.00 exemplary damages, regardless of the number of qualifying aggravating circumstances present; since accused-appellant was meted the penalty of reclusion perpetua for raping AAA, accused-appellant must be held liable to the modified amounts of P75,000.00 each as civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)

Moral damages 
- Article 2206 of the Civil Code expressly grants moral damages in addition to the award of civil indemnity; an award of P100,000.00 as moral damages, sufficient to answer for the mental anguish suffered by the Heirs of Catalina because of her death. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Moral damages are recoverable where the dismissal of the employee was attended by bad faith or fraud or constituted an act oppressive to labor, or was done in a manner contrary to morals, good customs, or public policy. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### DANGEROUS DRUGS

Animus possidendi 
- Animus possidendi is a state of mind; it is determined on a case-to-case basis taking into consideration the prior and contemporaneous acts of the accused and the surrounding circumstances; it must be inferred from the attendant events in each particular case; a mere unfounded assertion of the accused that he or she did not know that he or she had possession of the illegal drug is insufficient, animus possidendi is then presumed because he or she was thereby shown to have performed an act that the law prohibited and penalized; possession of dangerous drugs constitutes prima facie evidence of knowledge or animus possidendi sufficient to convict an accused in the absence of a satisfactory explanation; consequently, the burden of evidence is shifted to the accused to explain the absence of knowledge or animus possidendi. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### DENIAL

Defense of 
- Denial, if not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence, as in this case, is a negative and self-serving defense; it carries scant, if not nil, evidentiary value; it cannot prevail over the consistent and categorical declarations of credible witnesses on affirmative matters. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al. vs. G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- Pueyo's weak defense of denial crumbles before AAA's positive testimony; jurisprudence instructs that "between a categorical statement that has the earmarks of truth on the one hand and bare denial, on the other, the former is generally held to prevail"; no reason to hold otherwise in this case. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### DENIAL AND ALIBI

Defenses of 
- It is well-settled that denial is an "intrinsically weak defense which must be supported by strong evidence of non-culpability to merit credibility"; alibi, on the other hand, is the "weakest of all defenses, for it is easy to contrive and difficult to disprove and for which reason it is generally rejected; it is imperative that the accused establishes two elements: (1) he was not at the locus delicti at the time the offense was committed; and (2) it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission"; accused-appellant was unable to establish any of the foregoing elements to substantiate his alibi; the crime was committed in the same city where accused-appellant claimed he was at; thus, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission; in contrast to AAA's direct, positive, and categorical testimony, accused-appellant's defense will not stand. (People vs. Castillo, G.R. 242276, Feb. 18, 2020)

#### DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM ADJUDICATION BOARD (DARAB)

Jurisdiction 
- Even if the case for recovery of possession could be considered an agrarian dispute under R.A. 6657, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) would still have no jurisdiction over it; Rule II, Section 1.11 of the 2003 Rules of Procedure provides that the Board, as with the Provincial Adjudicator, has jurisdiction over cases that involve determining agricultural land titles "for the purpose of preserving the tenure of the agricultural lessee or actual tenant-farmer or farmer-beneficiaries and effecting the ouster of the interloper or intruder in one and the same proceeding"; neither petitioners nor their predecessors-in-interest disputed the issuance of titles in respondents' names; in any case, determinations of titles under Section 1.11 must be made for the purpose of preserving the tenure of the agricultural lessee or actual tenant-farmer or farmer-beneficiaries; since respondents had yet to submit the property under the CARP, any determination on the preservation of the tenure of petitioners, or their predecessors-in-interest, would have been premature; thus, the DARAB had no jurisdiction over respondents' action; any decision rendered without jurisdiction over the subject matter is considered a void judgment, which has no binding legal effect; Amoguis v. Ballado, cited. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The DARAB simply presumed that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest became respondents' tenants after the titles had been issued in respondents' names; tenancy, however, cannot be presumed, but must be proven; as echoed in Bumagat v. Arribay, among the requisites to establish tenancy is consent between the parties: A case involving agricultural land does not immediately qualify it as an agrarian dispute; the mere fact that the land is agricultural does not ipso facto make the possessor an agricultural lessee or tenant; there are conditions or requisites before he can qualify as an agricultural lessee or tenant, and the subject being agricultural land constitutes just one condition; for the DARAB to acquire jurisdiction over the case, there must exist a tenancy relation between the parties; in order for a tenancy agreement to take hold over a dispute, it is essential to establish all its indispensable elements: 1) that the parties are the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee; 2) that the subject matter of the relationship is an agricultural land; 3) that there is consent between the parties to the relationship; 4) that the purpose of the relationship is to bring about agricultural production; 5) that there is personal cultivation on the part of the tenant or agricultural lessee; and 6) that the harvest is shared between the landowner and the tenant or agricultural lessee. (Id.)

#### DEPOSITIONS PENDING ACTION

Requirements 
- Depositions pending action may be obtained without leave of court after an answer has been served in accordance with Section 1, Rule 23 of the Rules; there is no provision in Rule 23 that requires the party requesting for an oral deposition to state the purpose or purposes of the deposition; the only matters that have to be stated in the notice under Section 15 of Rule 23 are the time and place for taking the deposition, the name and address of each person to be examined, if known, or if unknown, a general description sufficient to identify the person to be examined or the class or group to which he belongs; the trial court cannot expand the requirements under Rule 23. (Malonzo, et al. vs. Sucere Foods Corporation, G.R. 240773, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The RTC observed that Section 3 of Rule 23 on examination and cross-examination and Section l7 on record, oath, and objections will be best complied with if the deposition is taken before the court instead of a notary public or any person authorized to administer oath; to require that these matters be taken before the RTC because they require the examination and cross-examination of the deponent would render useless the entire rules on discovery which were crafted by the Court to help expedite the disposition of cases; Section 10, Rule 23 of the Rules provides that depositions may be taken before any judge, notary public, or the person referred to in Section 14 of Rule 23, i.e., any person authorized to administer oaths if the parties so stipulate in writing; until the Court revises its rules and removes the authority to take depositions from the notary public or any person authorized to administer oaths if the parties so stipulate, these persons retain their authorities to take depositions; the trial courts cannot arrogate these duties exclusively upon themselves; hence, the CA did not commit any reversible error in setting aside the RTC's Order. (Id.)

#### DIRECT ASSAULT

Elements 
- Petitioner is charged with the second mode of direct assault under Art. 148 of the RPC; its elements are the following: 1. That the offender (a) makes an attack, (b) employs force, (c) makes a serious intimidation, or (d) makes a serious resistance. 2. That the person assaulted is a person in authority or his agent. 3. That at the time of the assault the person in authority or his agent (a) is engaged in the actual performance of official duties, or (b) that he is assaulted by reason of the past performance of official duties. 4. That the offender knows that the one he is assaulting is a person in authority or his agent in the exercise of his duties. 5. That there is no public uprising; a police officer is an agent of a person in authority; an agent of a person in authority is one who, "by direct provision of law or by election or by appointment by competent authority, is charged with the maintenance of public order and the protection and security of life and property, such as barrio councilman, barrio policeman and barangay leader, and any person who comes to the aid of persons in authority"; being a police officer, P02 Navarro is an agent of a person in authority; the second, third, fourth, and fifth elements of direct assault are present in this case; however, the first element of the offense is not present. (Mallari vs. People, G.R. 224679, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### EJECTMENT

Physical or material possession of the land 
- The sole issue in ejectment cases is physical or material possession of the subject property, independent of any claim of ownership by the parties; Section 16, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court provides the exception to the rule in that the issue of ownership shall be resolved in deciding the issue of possession if the question of possession is intertwined with the issue of ownership; in the related ejectment case, the parties were allowed to prove how they came into possession of the property; in the ejectment case, the issue of ownership over Creek I was resolved in favor of respondent; this Court has consistently held that where the issue of ownership is inseparably linked to that of possession, adjudication of the issue on ownership is not final and binding, but merely for the purpose of resolving the issue of possession; in an ejectment case, questions as to the validity of the title cannot be resolved definitively; a separate action to directly attack the validity of the title must be filed, as was in fact filed by petitioner, to fully thresh out as to who possesses a valid title over the subject property; thus, any ruling on ownership that was passed upon in the ejectment case is not and should not be binding on Civil Case No. 00-11133. (Tiña vs. Sta. Clara Estate, Inc., G.R. 239979, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### EMINENT DOMAIN OR EXPROPRIATION

Just compensation 
- As between the filing of the original Complaint and Amended Complaint, we rule that the computation of just compensation should be reckoned from the time of the filing of the original Complaint; there was no actual taking in this case prior to the filing of the Complaint, thus, the time of taking should be reckoned from the filing of the Complaint. Hence, the value of the property at the time of filing of the original Complaint which is deemed to be the time of taking of the property, and not the filing of the Amended Complaint, should be considered in determining the just compensation due to the respondents. (Republic vs. Castillo, et al., G.R. 190453, Feb. 26, 2020) 


- In eminent domain cases, just compensation entails not only the determination of the proper amount to be paid to the owners of the property, but also the payment of such amount within a reasonable time; in National Power Corporation v. Manalastas, the Court held that the just compensation payable to the property owner amounts to an effective forbearance on the part of the government – a proper subject of interest, viz.: If property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interests on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court; in fine, between the taking of the property and the actual payment, legal interests accrue in order to place the owner in a position as good as (but not better than) the position he was in before the taking occurred. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- It has been consistently held that the property's fair market value is the just compensation to which the owner of condemned property is entitled; market value is the price agreed on by a willing buyer and willing seller, both of whom are not compelled to enter into the transaction; it has also been described as the amount fixed in the open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal trade and competition. (Id.) 


- Just compensation is, as a general rule, based on the price or value of the property at the time the complaint for expropriation was filed; by way of exception, National Transmission Corporation v. Oroville Development Corporation instructs that when the government takes the property before initiating the expropriation case, the property's value at the time of the prior taking must be used as the basis for determining just compensation; here, since the Republic initiated expropriation proceedings before taking the subject property, it follows that the land's value at the time of the filing of the complaint, i.e., June 25, 1990, should be used as the basis for just compensation. (Id.)


- Necessarily, just compensation cannot be arrived at arbitrarily; it must be determined only after an evaluation of several factors; the assessment of these factors is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who must enlist commissioners tasked to receive and appraise evidence on the property's value; it has been held in a long line of cases that the determination of just compensation is a judicial function, one that is best addressed to the discretion of the trial court; the trial court, however, should not be without aid in the ascertainment of what constitutes just compensation; for this purpose and as alluded to earlier, the rules direct the court to appoint not more than three competent and disinterested persons as commissioners to ascertain and report to it the value of the property sought to be taken; the commissioners may then determine just compensation based on the evidence presented before them, and, for the same purpose, they are also authorized to enter and inspect the property and its surroundings; after the reception and scrutiny of the evidence, the commissioners have the responsibility of reporting their findings to the trial court; it has been held that trial with the aid of the commissioners is a substantial right; therefore, the appointment of commissioners to ascertain just compensation for the property sought to be taken is a mandatory requirement in expropriation cases; however, this does not mean that the commissioners' determination of just compensation is final and binding on the parties; because such determination is ultimately a judicial function, the trial court is given the discretion to either accept or reject the commissioners' findings in whole or in part; if the court rejects their report, it may require them to render a supplemental report on facts yet to be taken up, or it may appoint another set of commissioners to provide it with an entirely new report; the trial court is also allowed to disregard the findings of the commissioners and use its own estimate of the property's value; however, it may only do so for valid reasons, such as when the commissioners apply illegal principles to the evidence, when they disregard a clear preponderance of evidence, or when the amount allowed is either grossly inadequate or excessive; once the trial court is satisfied with the amount of just compensation, it may render judgment ordering payment thereof to the property owner. (Id.)


- Rule 67 of the Rules of Court governs expropriation proceedings; with respect to consequential damages, Section 6 of Rule 67 is instructive; in Republic v. Soriano, the Court deemed the award of consequential damages improper because "the subject property is being expropriated in its entirety, there is no remaining portion which may suffer an impairment or decrease in value as a result of the expropriation"; only a portion, and not the entire area, of the respondents' property was expropriated; the affected area of the expropriation undertaken was only "218 sq. m." out of the total area of 380 sq. m.; be that as it may, the Court deems the award of consequential damages in favor of the respondents erroneous; the sheer fact that there is a remaining portion of real property after the expropriation is not enough, by and of itself, to be basis for the award of consequential damages; it must still be proven by sufficient evidence that the remaining portion suffers from an impairment or decrease in value; a review of the records reveals that the RTC's award of consequential damages is not supported by any evidence establishing that the remaining 162 sq. m. of the subject property suffered from any impairment or decrease in value; therefore, the award of consequential damages must be deleted. (Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Vda. De Ramos, et al., G.R. 211576, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court finds that the RTC erred in ordering petitioner Republic to pay legal interest on the amount of just compensation; in Evergreen Manufacturing Corp. v. Republic, citing Apo Fruits Corporation v. Land Bank of the Philippines, the Court explained that "the rationale for imposing interest on just compensation is to compensate the property owners for the income that they would have made if they had been properly compensated 
- meaning if they had been paid the full amount of just compensation 
- at the time of taking when they were deprived of their property"; it is not disputed whatsoever that the respondents received the amount determined by the RTC as the just, fair, and equitable compensation for the subject property, i.e., P2,100.00 per sq. m. or P457,800.00, before petitioner Republic took possession of the subject property; hence, with the respondents having acknowledged the receipt of the full amount of just compensation even prior to the time of taking, petitioner is not liable for the payment of legal interest; the award of legal interest of 6 percent  per annum must be deleted. (Id.)


- While the Court considers the payment of transfer taxes as not forming part of the consequential damages allowed under the Rules of Court, it must be clarified, however, that the courts are not precluded from considering the value of capital gains tax (CGT) and other transfer taxes in determining the amount of just compensation to be awarded to the affected owner; the recent case of Republic of the Philippines v. Spouses Bunsay, Section 5 of R.A. 8974 sets forth the standards in the determination of just compensation: Section 5. Standards for the Assessment of the Value of the Land Subject of Expropriation Proceedings or Negotiated Sale. 
- In order to facilitate the determination of just compensation, the court may consider, among other well-established factors, the following relevant standards: (c) The value declared by the owners; . . . (h) Such facts and events as to enable the affected property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly-situated lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government, and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as possible; as further explained by the Court, CGT, being a tax on passive income, is imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code on the seller as a consequence of the latter's presumed income from the sale or exchange of real property; notably, however, the transfer of real property by way of expropriation is not an ordinary sale contemplated under Article 1458 of the Civil Code; rather, it is akin to a "forced sale" or one which arises not from the consensual agreement of the vendor and vendee, but by compulsion of law; unlike in an ordinary sale wherein the vendor sets the selling price, the compensation paid to the affected owner in an expropriation proceeding comes in the form of just compensation determined by the court; just compensation is defined as the fair and full equivalent of the loss incurred by the affected owner; the loss incurred by the affected owner necessarily includes all incidental costs to facilitate the transfer of the expropriated property to the expropriating authority, including the CGT due on the forced sale and other transfer taxes; these costs must be taken into consideration in determining just compensation in the same way these costs are factored into the selling price of real property in an arm's length transaction. (Id.)

Stages 
- The ascertainment of exactly how much property was taken is necessary to determine the full amount of just compensation; in expropriation cases involving land, just compensation is generally set on a per square meter basis; thus, without knowing the precise area taken by the State, there is no way of definitively setting the amount payable to the respondents; in addition, there is a need to determine how much of the respondents' property was expropriated so that they can be reimbursed only for what cannot be returned to them; jurisprudence clearly provides for the remedies available to a landowner when his land is taken by the government for public use; the owner may recover his or her property if its return is feasible, or, if it is not, he or she may demand payment of just compensation; upon remand, the trial court must first and foremost determine how much of respondent's property had actually been taken. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- The power of eminent domain has been described as "the ultimate right of the sovereign power to appropriate, not only the public but the private property of all citizens within the territorial sovereignty, to public purpose"; it is an inherent power of the state, not granted but merely limited by constitutional fiat, viz.: Section 9. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation; the provision places two express limitations on the power of eminent domain: first, the condemned property must be used for a public purpose, and second, the exercising authority must pay the property owner just compensation; correlatively, expropriation cases are divided into two stages; the first is concerned with the propriety of condemning the property, while the second involves the determination of just compensation; the first phase begins with the filing of the complaint before the trial court, which is then tasked to ascertain the purpose of the taking; if it finds that the property is being taken for a public purpose, it shall issue an order condemning the property, otherwise it must dismiss the case; if the court issues an order of condemnation, it must then proceed to the second phase—the determination of just compensation; for this purpose, the rules direct the trial court to appoint commissioners, who will be assigned to aid it in ascertaining the fair value of the expropriated property; the trial court will then set the amount of just compensation, order the plaintiff to pay such amount to the defendant, and proceed to completely dispose of the case. (Id.)


- The record shows a road now traverses the respondents' expropriated land; the payment of just compensation must therefore follow as a matter of course; however, the records do not show exactly how much of the property was taken; likewise, the time of taking by the government does not appear; thus, the Court is left with no other alternative but to remand the case to the trial court for a proper determination of: first, how much of the respondents' property had in fact been taken; second, when was the property so taken; and finally, the amount of just compensation due and owed to the respondents; the RTC must be guided by the pronouncements set forth hereunder, which shall form the law of the case. (Id.)

Taking 
- In the seminal case of Rep. of the Phils. v. Vda. de Castellvi, the Court laid down several circumstances that constitute the taking of private property in expropriation proceedings; these circumstances, adopted by subsequent case law, are summed up as follows: (1) the expropriator must enter private property; (2) the entrance in to private property must be for more than a momentary period; (3) the entry into the property should be under warrant or color of legal authority; (4) the property must be devoted to a public use or otherwise informally appropriated or injuriously affected; and (5) the utilization of the property for public use must be in such a way as to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment of the property; taking therefore occurs when the government actually deprives or dispossesses the proprietor of his or her property; so too, when there is "an intrusion so immediate and direct as to subtract from the owner's full enjoyment of the property and to limit his exploitation of it," the said property is deemed taken. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)


- The determination of the time of taking is necessary for two reasons; first, interest, which is imposed as damages for delaying the payment of just compensation, begins to run from the time the property is taken from its owner; second, the nature of the deposit required pending the determination of just compensation will depend on whether the property was taken before or after the date of effectivity of R.A. 8974, which governs expropriation proceedings relative to national government infrastructure projects. (Id.)

#### EMPLOYEES, KINDS OF

Managerial employees 
- In Casco, which cited Lima Land, Inc. v. Cuevas, We distinguished between managerial employees, on the one hand, and rank and file personnel on the other hand, insofar as terminating them on the basis of loss of trust and confidence, thus: As firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence, loss of trust and confidence, as a just cause for termination of employment, is premised on the fact that an employee concerned holds a position where greater trust is placed by management and from whom greater fidelity to duty is correspondingly expected; this includes managerial personnel entrusted with confidence on delicate matters, such as the custody, handling, or care and protection of the employer's property; the betrayal of this trust is the essence of the offense for which an employee is penalized; in a plethora of cases, this Court has distinguished the treatment of managerial employees from that of rank-and-file personnel, insofar as the application of the doctrine of loss of trust and confidence is concerned; with respect to rank-and-file personnel, loss of trust and confidence, as ground for valid dismissal, requires proof of involvement in the alleged events in question, and that mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the employer will not be sufficient; but as regards a managerial employee, proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for such loss of confidence, such as when the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee concerned is responsible for the purported misconduct, and the nature of his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded of his position. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452. Feb. 12, 2020)


- The determination of whether an employee is part of the managerial staff depends on the employee's duties and responsibilities: Managerial employees are defined as those vested with the powers or prerogatives to lay down management policies and to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees or effectively recommend such managerial actions; they refer to those whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed or of a department or a subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff; officers and members of the managerial staff perform work directly related to management policies of their employer and customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment; at the very least, Batucan held a supervisory position, which made him part of the managerial staff; Batucan was petitioner's team leader and officer-in-charge in LBC Danao. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP

Four-fold test 
- The lower tribunals used the "four-fold test" in determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, to wit: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the power to control the employee's conduct; the LA and the CA anchored their findings of employer-employee relationship on the Appointment Paper presented by respondent; this evidence, however, refers to his appointment as an instructor, as well as his duties and responsibilities as such; respondent was removed as a missionary of Abiko Baptist Church, not as an instructor of MBIS; there is no evidence or allegation to show that respondent's status as a missionary is the same or dependent on his appointment as an instructor of MBIS; the removal as a missionary may have affected respondent's status as instructor of MBIS, but the Court is not convinced that there was an illegal dismissal; the Mission Policy Agreement and Appointment Paper establish two (2) different positions held by respondent, and means that being a missionary of BSAABC is separate from being an instructor of MBIS, though they may be completely related. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Payment of wages 
- We do not find in the records concrete evidence of the alleged monthly compensation of respondent amounting to $550; respondent is not even consistent in claiming the exact amount of his supposed salary as he claims he was receiving $650 in his Motion for Reconsideration with the NLRC and Petition before the CA; although petitioners do not deny that respondent was receiving "love gifts" in the amount of $550, they aver that these came from ABA and Abiko Baptist Church in Japan; respondent also admitted that the "main bulk of the fund came from donor American Baptist Association"; "salary" is a general term defined as remuneration for services given, but the term does not establish a certain kind of relationship; absent any clear indication that the amount respondent was allegedly receiving came from BSAABC or MBIS, or at the very least that ABA, Abiko Baptist Church of Japan and BSAABC and MBIS are one and the same, We cannot concretely establish payment of wages. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Power to discipline or dismiss members 
- Dismissal is inherent in religious congregations as they have the power to discipline their members; the nature of respondent's position as a missionary calls on the exercise of supervision by the church of which he is a member considering that the basis of the relationship between a religious corporation and its members is the latter's absolute adherence to a common religious or spiritual belief; although respondent's removal is clear from the letter, this alone cannot establish an employer-employee relationship. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Power to dismiss employees 
- The NLRC was correct in holding that petitioners performed functions that pertain to those of supervisory classification; the positions that petitioners held involved trust and confidence requiring them to discharge their functions with utmost professionalism and uprightness; as held in Supra Multi-Services, Inc., et al. v. Labitigan, a company has the right to dismiss its employees as a measure of protection, more so in the case of supervisors or personnel who occupy positions of responsibility; an employer cannot be compelled to retain employees who are guilty of acts inimical to its interests; besides, the power to dismiss employees is a recognized prerogative that is inherent in the employer's right to freely manage and regulate its business. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Proof of 
- The respondent's appointment as instructor of petitioners' own educational institution was by virtue of his membership with Abiko Baptist Church; it is one of his duties as a missionary/minister of the same; he was teaching "bible history, philosophy, Christian doctrine, public speaking, English and other religious subjects to seminarians in MBIS intending to be a pastor/minister"; these subject matters and how they prepare or educate their ministers are ecclesiastical in nature which the State cannot regulate unless there is clear violation of secular laws; even his alleged exclusion as instructor is beyond the power of review by the State considering that this is purely an ecclesiastical affair; as to the power to order respondent to areas of mission work, the Court deems it appropriate not to expound on this because aside from being a mere allegation, it is also an ecclesiastical matter as it concerns governance of the congregation; other than the Appointment Paper (as an instructor), no other evidence was adduced by respondent to show an employer-employee relationship. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### EMPLOYMENT, TERMINATION OF

Abandonment 
- Abandonment is the deliberate and unjustified refusal of an employee to resume his employment; it constitutes neglect of duty and is a just cause for termination of employment under the Labor Code; to constitute abandonment, however, there must be a clear and deliberate intent to discontinue one's employment without any intention of returning; in this regard, two elements must concur: (1) failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason, and (2) a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship, with the second element as the more determinative factor and being manifested by some overt acts; employees who take steps to protest their dismissal cannot logically be said to have abandoned their work; a charge of abandonment is totally inconsistent with the immediate filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal; the filing thereof is proof enough of one's desire to return to work, thus negating any suggestion of abandonment. (JS Unitrade Merchandise, Inc. vs. Samson, Jr., G.R. 200405, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Respondents' charge of abandonment cannot likewise stand; settled is the rule that mere absence or failure to report for work is not tantamount to abandonment; the absence must be accompanied by overt acts unerringly pointing to the fact that the employee simply does not want to work anymore, and the burden of proof to show that there was unjustified refusal to go back to work rests on the employer, which unfortunately, respondents likewise failed to show. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)


- To constitute abandonment there must be a clear and deliberate intent to discontinue one's employment without any intention of returning; to successfully raise abandonment as a just cause for dismissal, two elements must concur: first, failure to report for work or absence without valid or justifiable reason, and second, a clear intention to sever the employer-employee relationship; the second element, being manifested by overt acts, is the more determinative factor; here, Dela Cruz ceased reporting for work as a result of her suspension which she claimed to constitute illegal dismissal; upon the lapse of the preventive suspension period, she was no longer reinstated by ENLI; thus, her absence from work was not due to a deliberate act of abandonment on her part but an act of constructive dismissal on the part of ENLI. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

Burden of proof 
- In termination cases, the employer bears the burden of proving that the employee's dismissal was for a valid and authorized cause; consequently, the failure of the employer to prove that the dismissal was valid, would mean that the dismissal was unjustified, and thus illegal; petitioners failed to discharge the burden. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)

Constructive dismissal 
- Although Batucan holds a supervisory position, he cannot be deemed to have acted on petitioner's behalf in committing the acts of sexual harassment; it cannot be assumed that all the illegal acts of managerial staff are authorized or sanctioned by the company, especially when it is committed in the manager's personal capacity; in Verdadero v. Barney Autolines Group of Companies Transport, Inc., this Court ruled that constructive dismissal cannot be assumed if an officer of the company wronged an employee, but the employer did not authorize the act: It is to be emphasized that the abovementioned acts should have been committed by the employer against the employee; unlawful acts committed by a co-employee will not bring the matter within the ambit of constructive dismissal. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Case law defines "constructive dismissal" as follows: Constructive dismissal is defined as quitting or cessation of work because continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; when there is a demotion in rank or a diminution of pay and other benefits; it exists if an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him except to forego his continued employment; while Roxas's reduced work assignment did effectively result in the diminution of his pay and other benefits, the same did not amount to a clear act of discrimination, insensibility or disdain on the part of BTI so as to force him out of employment; as pointed out by the CA, "the reduced work week which BTI implemented in 2012 was in relation to the government's directive to remove from the roads, public utility vehicles which are 15 years old and above, for the safety of the riding public; the decision to phase out BTI's old buses was therefore not done out of the company's whims and caprices only but instead, a means on the part of BTI to cope with the downsizing of their business operation as consequence of the strict implementation of LTFRB Resolution No. 2013-01"; this exercise of BTI's management prerogative appears to have been done in good faith, and hence, should be upheld; the records fail to show that Roxas was the only employee affected by the reduced work assignment scheme. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Constructive dismissal occurs when an employer makes an employee's continued employment impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, or has made an employee's working conditions or environment harsh, hostile and unfavorable, such that the employee feels obliged to resign from his or her employment; common examples are when the employee is demoted, or when his or her pay or benefits are reduced; however, constructive dismissal is not limited to these instances; the gauge to determine whether there is constructive dismissal, is whether a reasonable person would feel constrained to resign from his or her employment because of the circumstances, conditions, and environment created by the employer for the employee. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Section 9 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code limits the duration of the preventive suspension to a maximum of 30 days; Section 9 is clear that the employer had the positive duty of reinstating the preventively suspended employee upon the lapse of the 30-day period sans extension; when the period of preventive suspension exceeds the maximum period allowed without reinstating the employee actually or through payroll, or when the preventive suspension is for an indefinite period, constructive dismissal sets in; it is admitted that while Dela Cruz's complaint before the Labor Arbiter was pending, the 30-day preventive suspension period expired without ENLI causing its extension; despite the expiration of the preventive suspension period, Dela Cruz did not report for work; however, there was nary an effort on the part of ENLI to reinstate Dela Cruz to her former position either actually or through payroll; the circumstances, taken together, inevitably lead to the conclusion that upon the expiration of the preventive suspension on July 22, 2012, constructive dismissal had set in; having been constructively dismissed, Dela Cruz is entitled to the payment of backwages from the time of her dismissal up to the finality of this decision; she is likewise entitled to reinstatement but considering that seven years have lapsed, it is more in consonance with substantive justice to award her with separation pay computed at one month pay for every year of service. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

Ecclesiastical affairs and secular matters 
- While the State is prohibited from interfering in purely ecclesiastical affairs, the Church is likewise barred from meddling in purely secular matters; an ecclesiastical affair is "one that concerns doctrine, creed, or form of worship of the church, or the adoption and enforcement within a religious association of needful laws and regulations for the government of the membership, and the power of excluding from such associations those deemed unworthy of membership"; based on this definition, an ecclesiastical affair involves the relationship between the church and its members and relates to matters of faith, religious doctrines, worship and governance of the congregation; examples of these so-called ecclesiastical affairs in which the State cannot meddle are proceedings for excommunication, ordinations of religious ministers, administration of sacraments and other activities with attached religious significance"; secular matters, on the other hand, have no relation whatsoever with the practice of faith, worship or doctrines of the church. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Ecclesiastical matters 
- There were three (3) acts which were decided upon by the Abiko Baptist Church against respondent in its letter, to wit: (1) removal as a missionary of Abiko Baptist Church; (2) cancellation of the ABA recommendation as a national missionary; and (3) exclusion of membership from Abiko Baptist Church in Japan; to the mind of the Court, the exclusion of membership from Abiko Baptist Church in Japan and the cancellation of ABA recommendation as a national missionary are ecclesiastical matters which this jurisdiction will not touch upon; these matters are exclusively determined by the church in accordance with the standards they have set; the Court cannot meddle in these affairs since the church has the discretion to choose members who live up to their religious standards; the ABA recommendation as a national missionary is likewise discretionary upon the church since it is a matter of governance of congregation. (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Illegal dismissal 
- Gallego patiently waited for three years hoping that he would be re-deployed as promised by respondents; awarding him P200,000.00 moral damages is proper; P200,000.00 exemplary damages awarded to serve as a deterrent to future and subsequent parties from the commission of a similar offense; attorney's fees or 10 percent  of the monetary award, also awarded because he was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect his rights and interests; all monetary awards to petitioner shall be subject to ten percent (10 percent ) rate as attorney's fees and shall earn the legal interest of six percent (6 percent ) per annum from the date this Decision becomes final and executory until full satisfaction thereof. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In view of the finding of illegal dismissal, Erispe is entitled to the monetary equivalent of his vacation leave benefits as to the unexpired portion of his contract; the employer is obliged to pay an illegally dismissed employee or worker the whole amount of the salaries or wages, plus all other benefits and bonuses and general increases, to which he would have been normally entitled had he not been illegally terminated and had not stopped working; thus, Erispe must be awarded his salaries corresponding to the unexpired portion of his employment contract, or equivalent to 7.36 months as found by the LA; this includes all his corresponding monthly vacation leave pay which is expressly provided in the employment contracts, which is three days per month. (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Just or authorized causes 
- Article 294 of the Labor Code, as renumbered, provides that an employer may terminate the services of an employee only upon just or authorized causes; the burden of proving that the dismissal was for a just or authorized cause lies with the employer; if the employer fails to meet this burden, the conclusion would be that the dismissal was unjustified, and, therefore, illegal; in order to discharge this burden, the employer must present substantial evidence, which is defined as that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion, and not based on mere surmises and conjectures; in this regard, Article 297 of the Labor Code enumerates the just causes for which an employer may terminate an employment. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

Loss of trust and confidence 
- Article 297 (formerly 282) of the Labor Code provides that an employer may terminate its employee for "fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative"; "the requisites for dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence are: (1) the employee concerned must be holding a position of trust and confidence; (2) there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence; and (3) such loss of trust relates to the employee's performance of duties." (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Cadavas v. Court of Appeals, citing Bristol Myers Squibb (Phils.), Inc. v. Baban, explained the two classes of positions of trust, thus: There are two (2) classes of positions of trust; the first class consists of managerial employees; they are defined as those vested with the powers or prerogatives to lay down management policies and to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees or effectively recommend such managerial actions; the second class consists of cashiers, auditors, property custodians, etc.; they are defined as those who in the normal and routine exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property; "managerial employees refer to those whose primary duty consists of the management of the establishment in which they are employed, or of a department or a subdivision thereof, and to other officers or members of the managerial staff." (Id.)


- Casco explains the concept of loss of trust and confidence as a valid ground for termination of employment: Loss of trust and confidence as a valid ground for dismissal is premised on the fact that the employee holds a position whose functions may only be performed by someone who enjoys the trust and confidence of the management; such employee bears a greater burden of trustworthiness than ordinary workers, and the betrayal of the trust reposed is the essence of the loss of trust and confidence that becomes the basis for the employee's dismissal. (Id.)

Misconduct 
- Misconduct has been defined as an improper or wrong conduct; "it is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment"; for misconduct or improper behavior to be a just cause for dismissal, there must be a concurrence of the following elements: (a) the misconduct must be serious; (b) it must relate to the performance of the employee's duties showing that the employee has become unfit to continue working for the employer; and (c) it must have been performed with wrongful intent. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Misconduct involves the transgression of some established and definite rule or action, a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, willful in character, and implies wrongful intent and not mere error in judgment; for misconduct to be serious and therefore a valid ground for dismissal, it must be (a) of grave and aggravated character and not merely trivial or unimportant, (b) connected with the work of the employee such that the latter has become unfit to continue working for the employer, and (c) performed with wrongful intent; here, respondents failed to show that Roxas's filing of the complaints for constructive dismissal against the company was impelled by any ill-motive amounting to gross misconduct. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

Neglect of duty 
- "Neglect of duty, as a ground for dismissal, must be both gross and habitual"; in Casco, We pronounced that: Gross negligence implies a want or absence of or a failure to exercise slight care or diligence, or the entire absence of care; it evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them; habitual neglect implies repeated failure to perform one's duties for a period of time, depending upon the circumstances. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)

Preventive suspension 
- Placing an employee under preventive suspension is allowed under Section 8, Rule XXIII, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, as amended; preventive suspension is not a penalty but a disciplinary measure to protect life or property of the employer or the co-workers pending investigation of any alleged infraction committed by the employee; thus, it is justified only when the employee's continued employment poses a serious and imminent threat to the employer's or co-workers' life or property; when justified, the preventively suspended employee is not entitled to the payment of his salaries and benefits for the period of suspension; Dela Cruz's preventive suspension was justified considering that, as branch manager, she had unlimited access to the Calamba branch's finances, property, and records; as Dela Cruz herself admitted, she managed the Calamba branch as if she were the owner thereof. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

Procedural due process 
- The respondent SPC was shown to have afforded petitioners their right to due process; in termination proceedings or employees, procedural due process consists of the twin requirements of notice and hearing; the employer is required to furnish the employees with two written notices before the termination of employment can be effected: (1) the first apprises the employees of the particular acts or omissions for which their dismissal is sought; and (2) the second informs the employees of the employer's decision to dismiss them; there is compliance with the requirement of a hearing as long as there was an opportunity to be heard, and not necessarily that an actual hearing was conducted; here, petitioners were issued show cause notices and were made to explain; they were then subjected to investigation wherein they were given the opportunity to defend themselves; thereafter, respondent SPC found them guilty of the charges and issued notices of dismissal; considering respondent SPC's compliance with procedural due process, there is no other logical conclusion than that petitioners' dismissal was valid. (Iso, Jr., et al. vs. Salcon Power Corporation (now SPC Power Corporation), G.R. 219059, Feb. 12, 2020)

Recomputation of backwages 
- The final and executory decision referred to by complainants pertain to the May 26, 2000 Decision of the CA, which had been affirmed by this Court on June 20, 2001; a corresponding Entry of Judgment was issued on September 13, 2001 as to this adjudication; by redefining the scope of backwages which only included their salaries, complainants claim that the CA varied the terms of the original judgment; ascertaining the scope of backwages involves a recomputation thereof; it has long been settled that no essential change is made by a recomputation as this step is a necessary consequence that flows from the nature of the illegality of dismissal declared in that decision; by the nature of an illegal dismissal case, the reliefs continue to add on until full satisfaction thereof; the recomputation of the awards stemming from an illegal dismissal case does not constitute an alteration or amendment of the final decision being implemented. (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Redundancy —There is no dispute that petitioner was separated from service due to redundancy pursuant to Article 283 of the Labor Code; as she was dismissed due to redundancy, she is entitled to receive, under the law, a separation pay equivalent to at least one month pay for every year of her service. (Mateo vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc., G.R. 226064, Feb. 17, 2020)

Retrenchment 
- Article 283 of the Labor Code requires the employer to serve a written notice on the workers and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) at least one (1) month before the intended date of retrenchment; in case of retrenchment, the separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher; the retrenchment of complainants was found to be bona fide but the required notices were evidently lacking; the purpose of a written notice under Article 283 of the Labor Code is to give employees time to prepare for the eventual loss of their jobs as well as to give the DOLE the opportunity to ascertain the veracity of the alleged cause of termination; here, there was no actual notice of termination; BATELEC II merely assumed that complainants knew about the retrenchment when they actively participated in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter who tackled the validity of the reorganization; the offer to pay separation pay is not sufficient to replace the formal requirement of written notice; at the time the reorganization took place, complainants were reinstated on payroll so they were deemed employees of BATELEC II; there was no reason why BATELEC II could not have served them notice of retrenchment before actually dismissing them; pursuant to Serrano which the appellate court hesitantly applied, complainants were entitled to separation pay and backwages up to September 13, 2001; however, in the subsequent cases of Agabon v. National Labor Relations Commission and Jaka Food Processing Corporation v. Pacot, the Court now orders payment of nominal damages for valid dismissals due to just or authorized cause but not compliant to statutory due process; no reason why the Court should not apply Jaka retroactively in this case too; pursuant to Jaka, we direct BATELEC II to pay only indemnity in the amount of 50,000.00 each to all complainants; finally, complainants are entitled to legal interest; pursuant to Nacar v. Gallery Frames, the rate of legal interest shall be 6 percent  per annum computed from the date of the promulgation of this judgment until fully paid. (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

Secular matters 
- The matter of terminating an employee, which is purely secular in nature, is different from the ecclesiastical act of expelling a member from the religious congregation; petitioners insist that this case is an ecclesiastical affair as there is no employer-employee relationship between BSAABC/MBIS and respondent; in order to settle the issue, it is imperative to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship; it was previously ruled that "in an illegal dismissal case, the onus probandi rests on the employer to prove that its dismissal of an employee was for a valid cause; however, before a case for illegal dismissal can prosper, an employer-employee relationship must first be established; thus, in filing a complaint before the LA for illegal dismissal, based on the premise that he was an employee of petitioners, it is incumbent upon respondent to prove the employer-employee relationship by substantial evidence." (Bishop Shinji Amari of Abiko Baptist Church, represented by Shinji Amari, et al. vs. Villaflor, Jr., G.R. 224521, Feb. 17, 2020)

Separation pay 
- Having failed to establish by substantial evidence the just causes for Roxas's termination, it was error for the CA to not find grave abuse of discretion on the part of the NLRC in holding that the dismissal was valid; Article 294 of the Labor Code provides that an employee who is unjustly dismissed from work is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him, which in this case is reckoned from the time of his illegal dismissal on July 21, 2015, up to the time of his actual reinstatement; however, if reinstatement is no longer possible, the employer has the option of paying the employee his separation pay in lieu of reinstatement; considering the length of time that had passed since the controversy started and the existing regulation on the use of buses that has affected respondents' operations, there is a need to remand the case to the NLRC to determine if Roxas's reinstatement, as consistently prayed for, is still viable under the circumstances. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Since there is no illegal dismissal nor abandonment to speak of here, the logical step would have been to allow respondent to resume his position as Associate Area Sales Manager for South Luzon; as it was, respondent's reinstatement is no longer feasible because of the parties' strained relation; in case the reinstatement is no longer feasible, as in this case, an award of separation pay, in lieu of reinstatement, is justified; the Court has ruled that reinstatement is no longer feasible: (a) when the former position of the illegally dismissed employee no longer exists; or (b) when the employer's business has closed down; or (c) when the employer-employee relationship has already been strained as to render the reinstatement impossible; the Court likewise considered reinstatement to be non-feasible because a "considerable time" has lapsed between the dismissal and the resolution of the case. (JS Unitrade Merchandise, Inc. vs. Samson, Jr., G.R. 200405, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The CA found, and this Court agrees, that reinstatement is no longer feasible, and thus separation pay in lieu of reinstatement is in order; this Court is not unaware that under the law and prevailing jurisprudence, an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement as a matter of right; however, if reinstatement would only aggravate the tension and strained relations between the parties, or where the relationship between the employer and the employee has been unduly strained by reason of their irreconcilable differences, it would be more prudent to order payment of separation pay instead of reinstatement. (Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. Cuizon, G.R. 184452, Feb. 12, 2020)

Serious misconduct 
- It cannot be said that the penalty of dismissal is commensurate to Llorente's act of disobedience; however, viewed with the charge of serious misconduct, termination is justified under the circumstances; the records of the case are also replete with evidence of Llorente's past infractions, which the Court deemed no longer necessary to discuss, as these were not included by MPI in the Memorandum and the Notice of Termination served to Llorente; these are indicative of Llorente's unbecoming behavior at work and wanton disregard of his employment with MPI. (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Llorente's actuations of copying a patient's personal information and using it to malign MPI by relaying a false narrative are indicative of his wrongful intent; his actions comprise serious misconduct because as a nursing attendant, he has access to private and confidential information of MPI's patients, but he did not only illicitly copy the personal information of a patient of MPI, he also used the information to fulfill a deceit purpose; thus, MPI is justified in terminating the employment of Llorente. (Id.)

Voluntary resignation and constructive dismissal 
- In Saudi Arabian Airlines v. Rebesencio, this Court differentiated between voluntary resignation and constructive dismissal: In Bilbao v. Saudi Arabian Airlines, this court defined voluntary resignation as "the voluntary act of an employee who is in a situation where one believes that personal reasons cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service, and one has no other choice but to dissociate oneself from employment; it is a formal pronouncement or relinquishment of an office, with the intention of relinquishing the office accompanied by the act of relinquishment"; essential to the act of resignation is voluntariness; it must be the result of an employee's exercise of his or her own will; on the other hand, constructive dismissal has been defined as "cessation of work because ‘continued employment is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely, as an offer involving a demotion in rank or a diminution in pay' and other benefits." (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

Willful disobedience or insubordination 
- Llorente's refusal to heed the directives of the nursing attendant head, by itself, is insufficient to warrant his termination from employment; for dismissal to be valid under this ground, the following must be present: (a) there must be disobedience or insubordination; (b) the disobedience or insubordination must be willful or intentional characterized by a wrongful or perverse attitude; (c) the order violated must be reasonable, lawful, and made known to the employee; and (d) the order must pertain to the duties which he has been engaged to discharged. (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Neither can the Court subscribe to respondents' assertion that there was insubordination on the part of Roxas when he repeatedly refused to heed the company's directive to submit additional explanation as to why he filed his complaints; "willful disobedience or insubordination, as a just cause for the dismissal of an employee, necessitates the concurrence of at least two (2) requisites, namely: (a) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful, that is, characterized by a wrongful and perverse attitude; and (b) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee, and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge"; none of the foregoing requisites were present in the case at bar. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### EQUIPOISE RULE

Concept —The equipoise rule is inapplicable here; this criminal law principle is explained in brief in Tin v. People, a case relied on by Arriola: Under this rule, where the evidence on an issue of fact is in equipoise or there is doubt on which side the evidence preponderates, the party having the burden of proof loses; the equipoise rule finds application if the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, for then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty, and does not suffice to produce a conviction; briefly stated, the needed quantum of proof to convict the accused of the crime charged is found lacking; conviction rests not on the frailty of the defense but on the strength and sufficiency of the evidence of the prosecution; here, however, the scales of the evidence had already tilted heavily against the defense; We perceive no conflicting versions, as Arriola technically failed to set forth his own version in the first place; his guilt was finely established with the required quantum of proof, which is proof beyond reasonable doubt. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### ESTAFA BY MEANS OF FALSE PRETENSE OR DECEIT

Elements 
- As laid down by jurisprudence, the elements of Estafa by means of deceit under Article 315, Paragraph 2(a) of the RPC are as follows: (1) That there must be a false pretense or fraudulent representation as to the offender's power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business, or imaginary transactions; (2) That such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (3) That the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and (4) That, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)


- Rios was charged and convicted for eight counts of Estafa under Article 315(2)(a) of the RPC, which provides for one of the modes of committing Estafa: 2. By means of any of the following false pretenses or fraudulent acts executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud: (a) By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits; the elements of Estafa by means of false pretenses or deceit were enumerated by the Court in Sy v. People: x x x (a) that there must be a false pretense or fraudulent representation as to his power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or imaginary transactions; (b) that such false pretense or fraudulent representation was made or executed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of the fraud; (c) that the offended party relied on the false pretense, fraudulent act, or fraudulent means and was induced to part with his money or property; and (d) that, as a result thereof, the offended party suffered damage. In the instant cases, the element of false pretense or fraudulent representations is lacking. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The return by the accused of money belonging to the private complainant will not reverse a consummated act of Estafa; quite the contrary, such action may even uphold a conviction. Section 27, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court states that in criminal cases, except those involving quasi-offenses or criminal negligence or those allowed by law to be compromised, an offer of compromise by the accused may be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt; here, Arriola's initial attempts to reimburse Del Rosario through checks, coupled with the actual return of the latter's money after the RTC issued its judgment of conviction, may all be considered as unequivocal gestures to compromise and which can be measured against Arriola as his implied admission of guilt. (Id.)

Fraud and deceit 
- As defined in People v. Balasa: Fraud, in its general sense, is deemed to comprise anything calculated to deceive, including all acts, omissions, and concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence justly reposed, resulting in damage to another, or by which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another; it is a generic term embracing all multifarious means which human ingenuity can device, and which are resorted to by one individual to secure an advantage over another by false suggestions or by suppression of truth and includes all surprise, trick, cunning, dissembling and any unfair way by which another is cheated; on the other hand, deceit is the false representation of a matter of fact whether by words or conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which should have been disclosed which deceives or is intended to deceive another so that he shall act upon it to his legal injury. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Good faith as a defense 
- Good faith is "an elusive idea, taking on different meanings and emphases as we move from one context to another"; it is, in general, a state of mind consisting in honesty in belief or purpose, faithfulness to one's duty or obligation, observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in a given trade or business, absence of intent to defraud or seek unconscionable advantage, or a belief in one's legal title or right; being malum in se, and depending on the proven circumstances, good faith and lack of criminal intent are indeed available defenses against a prosecution for Estafa; however, all-encompassing this definition is, good faith still cannot be appreciated in favor of Arriola. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Penalty 
- R.A. 10951 adjusted the amount or value of the property and damage upon which the penalties for crimes and offenses are based, and the fines imposed therefor; Section 85 thereof specifically provides for violations of Article 315, Paragraph 2(a) of the RPC: . . . In light of RA 10951 and the recent pronouncements (Seguritan v. People and People v. Dejolde, Jr.), Arriola's penalty is hereby modified to arresto mayor in its minimum period to prision correccional in its minimum period, further narrowed down to an indeterminate penalty of two (2) months and one (1) day of arresto mayor, as minimum, to one (1) year and one (1) day of prision correccional, as maximum. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### EVIDENCE

Admissibility of 
- This Court sustains the RTC ruling that even if the subject ink cartridges are admitted as evidence, it does not necessarily follow that they are given probative weight; this Court held in Mancol, Jr. v. Development Bank of the Philippines that: admissibility of evidence should not be confused with its probative value; the admissibility of evidence depends on its relevance and competence, while the weight of evidence pertains to evidence already admitted and its tendency to convince and persuade; the admissibility of a particular item of evidence has to do with whether it meets various tests by which its reliability is to be determined, so as to be considered with other evidence admitted in the case in arriving at a decision as to the truth; the weight of evidence is not determined mathematically by the numerical superiority of the witnesses testifying to a given fact, but depends upon its practical effect in inducing belief on the part of the judge trying the case; "admissibility refers to the question of whether certain pieces of evidence are to be considered at all, while probative value refers to the question of whether the admitted evidence proves an issue"; "thus, a particular item of evidence may be admissible, but its evidentiary weight depends on judicial evaluation within the guidelines provided by the rules of evidence." (Yokohama Tire Philippines, Inc. vs. Reyes, et al., G.R. 236686, Feb. 5, 2020)

Circumstantial evidence 
- Circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction if: (a) There is more than one circumstance; (b) The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt; circumstantial evidence may support a conviction if they afford as basis for a reasonable inference of the existence of the fact thereby sought to be proved; to sustain a conviction based on circumstantial evidence, it is essential that the circumstantial evidence presented must constitute an unbroken chain, which leads one to a fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of the others, as the guilty person; the circumstantial evidence must exclude the possibility that some other person has committed the crime. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

Hearsay rule 
- Section 36, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court does declare hearsay as generally inadmissible testimonial evidence: Section 36. Testimony generally confined to personal knowledge; hearsay excluded. 
- A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception; evidence is called hearsay when its probative force depends, in whole or in part, on the competency and credibility of some persons other than the witness by whom it is sought to produce it; a person who introduces a hearsay statement is not obliged to enter into any particular stipulation, to answer any question, to solve any difficulties, to reconcile any contradictions, to explain any obscurities, to remove any ambiguities; and that he/she entrenches himself/herself in the simple assertion that he/she was told so, and leaves the burden entirely upon the dead or absent author; the hearsay rule, however, does not apply to independently relevant statements; People v. Umapas is instructive on the matter: [W]hile the testimony of a witness regarding a statement made by another person given for the purpose of establishing the truth of the fact asserted in the statement is clearly hearsay evidence, it is otherwise if the purpose of placing the statement on the record is merely to establish the fact that the statement, or the tenor of such statement, was made; regardless of the truth or falsity of a statement, when what is relevant is the fact that such statement has been made, the hearsay rule does not apply and the statement may be shown; as a matter of fact, evidence as to the making of the statement is not secondary but primary, for the statement itself may constitute a fact in issue or is circumstantially relevant as to the existence of such a fact. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

Preponderance of evidence 
- In civil cases, like in a complaint for a sum of money, the burden of proof lies on the party who asserts the affirmative of the issue; in such a case, the party, whether plaintiff or defendant, must establish his case by preponderance of evidence; preponderance of evidence is the weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be synonymous with the term "greater weight of evidence" or "greater weight of the credible evidence"; preponderance of evidence is a phrase, which, in the last analysis, means probability of truth; it is that evidence which is more convincing to the court as worthier of belief than that which is offered in opposition thereto; further, preponderance of evidence is determined by considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, culled from the evidence, regardless of who actually presented it. (Spouses Garcia, doing business under the name and style of Ecolamp Multi-Resources vs. Northern Islands, Co., Inc., G.R. 226495, Feb. 5, 2020) 


- The Court finds that respondent Northern proved its cause of action by preponderance of evidence; as aptly found by the CA, the goods delivered and received in April to July 2004 created an obligation on the part of Ecolamp to pay respondent Northern as it fell due; here, however, petitioner Spouses Garcia failed to present evidence to prove payment thereof; deliveries to Ecolamp having been established by preponderance of evidence, the CA did not err in ordering petitioner Spouses to pay respondent Northern the value of the 3D appliances in the amount of P6,478,700.00 as shown by the various delivery cargo receipts the details of which correspond to the details found in the bills of lading; the Court finds the CA's imposition of 12 percent  interest per annum from date of last extrajudicial demand on May 4, 2005 until June 30, 2013, and 6 percent  per annum from July 1, 2013 until finality of this Decision in place; thereafter, the principal amount due as adjusted by interest shall likewise earn an interest at 6 percent  per annum until its full satisfaction. (Id.)

Substantial evidence 
- Every person has the right to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; considering the gravity of the consequences of the disbarment or suspension of a lawyer, the Court has consistently ruled that a lawyer enjoys the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof rests upon the complainant to satisfactorily prove the allegations in his/her complaint through substantial evidence; time and again, the Court has held that mere allegation is not evidence and is not equivalent to proof; while the Court agrees with the recommendation of the IBP-BOG to dismiss the disbarment complaint; the quantum of proof in administrative cases is substantial evidence and not preponderance of evidence; this issue had already been clarified in Reyes v. Nieva where the Court held that: Besides, the evidentiary threshold of substantial evidence 
- as opposed to preponderance of evidence 
- is more in keeping with the primordial purpose of and essential considerations attending this type of cases; as case law elucidates, "disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are sui generis; neither purely civil nor purely criminal, they do not involve a trial of an action or a suit, but is rather an investigation by the Court into the conduct of one of its officers." (Spouses Nocuenca vs. Atty. Bensi, A.C. No. 12609, Feb. 10, 2020)


- It appears that the CA overlooked that "the quantum of proof required in determining the legality of an employee's dismissal is only substantial evidence," which is "that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion"; aside from the CCTV footage where Llorente was seen copying from the records and pocketing the paper where he wrote the information, Nurses Dumalanta and Manawat submitted their written statements avowing that they recognized Llorente's voice on the speaker phone as the latter talked to Tan's mother; these circumstances constitute substantial evidence of Llorente's wrongdoing; the Court reiterates that "as opposed to the ‘proof beyond reasonable doubt' standard of evidence required in criminal cases, labor suits require only substantial evidence to prove the validity of the dismissal"; "the standard of substantial evidence is satisfied where the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the employee is responsible for the misconduct and his participation therein renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position." (Metro Psychiatry, Inc. vs. Llorente, G.R. 245258, Feb. 5, 2020)


- It is fundamental that the quantum of proof in administrative cases such as disbarment proceedings is substantial evidence; substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds, equally reasonable, might conceivably opine otherwise; while Zamora is correct that the very pleading itself is the best piece of evidence to prove whether Atty. Mahinay had, indeed, violated Canon 11, Rule 11.03 of the CPR, this proffered evidence failed to reach the threshold of the quantum of proof required; the Court does not find the language used in the subject motion for reconsideration to be offensive, abusive, malicious, or intemperate in any way; it did not spill over the walls of decency or propriety. (Zamora vs. Atty. Mahinay, A.C. No. 12622, Feb. 10, 2020 [Formerly CBD Case No. 15-4651])


- Suicide had been indubitably established; technical rules of procedure are not binding in labor cases, and the quantum of proof required here is only substantial evidence, defined as "that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion"; while it may be true that the documentary evidence adduced by respondents were photocopies, the Court cannot discount the fact that the statements of the crew members of the vessel as well as the autopsy report issued by the Sri Lankan authority coincide with the NBI autopsy report which concluded that the cause of death to be "consistent with asphyxia by ligature"; the NBI autopsy report lends credence to and bolsters the account of the respondents that Manuel took his own life. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### EVIDENCE CUSTODIAN

Duties 
- Equally accountable with Atty. Toledo was Barcelona who also failed to exercise reasonable care and diligence in performing her duties as evidence custodian; Barcelona did not observe such diligence required under the circumstances when she ordered Esguerra to simply place the shabu evidence under her computer table, in total disregard of its legal value as the very corpus delicti of the offense; all that is needed in the safekeeping of court evidence or property is the exercise of ordinary prudence and common sense, which Barcelona obviously failed to do; even without a specific instruction from anyone, common sense should have impelled Barcelona to list down the physical evidence received by the court for its safekeeping inclusive of the vital details pertaining thereto such as the date and time of reception and the identity of the person who handed the evidence to her. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Atty. Toledo, then Branch Clerk of Court [Now Clerk of Court V], et al., A.M. No. P-13-3124, Feb. 4, 2020)

#### EXEMPTING CIRCUMSTANCES

Irresistible force and/or uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury 
- To avail of the exempting circumstance of " irresistible force and/or uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury", the evidence must establish: (1) the existence of an uncontrollable fear; (2) that the fear must be real and imminent; and (3) the fear of an injury is greater than or at least equal to that committed; a threat of future injury is insufficient; the compulsion must be of such a character as to leave no opportunity for the accused to escape. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### FORUM SHOPPING

Commission of 
- Section 5, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, cited; by filing with the Panel a second motion for reconsideration in the guise of a Manifestation with Opposition, and without awaiting the result thereof, appealing before the CA, and thereafter filing once again with the Panel a Reiterative Motion, petition avers that respondents committed forum shopping; while the Court agrees with the petitioner that respondents' Manifestation with Opposition is in reality a second motion for reconsideration and its Reiterative Motion is another motion for reconsideration, there are good reasons which militate against the finding of forum shopping in this case; the Manifestation with Opposition, being a second motion for reconsideration, and the Reiterative Motion, being technically a third motion for reconsideration, their filing thereof is prohibited under Section 2, Rule 52 of the Rules of Civil Procedure; regarded as mere scrap of paper that do not deserve any consideration and do not have any legal effect; in addition, the Reiterative Motion is no longer within the Panel's competence to decide; thus, no forum shopping in this case. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT REFORM ACT (R.A. 9184)

Invitation to apply for eligibility and to bid (IAEB) 
- Section 21 of R.A. 9184 mandates that the procuring entity, in this case the Municipality of Looc, shall cause the advertisement of the invitation to bid, thus: SEC. 21. Advertising and Contents of the Invitation to Bid. – In line with the principle of transparency and competitiveness, all Invitations to Bid for contracts under competitive bidding shall be advertised by the Procuring Entity; R.A. 9184 intends to reach the broadest number of prospective participants to join the public bidding; this is in line with the law's policy of promoting transparency and competitiveness during the entire bidding process. (Jomadiao, et al. vs. Arboleda, G.R. 230322, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The duty of publication falls upon the BAC Secretariat, and his or her certification as to the fact of posting refutes allegations to the contrary; the petitioners, as provisional BAC members, are not responsible for the actual posting of the IAEB and the corresponding payment, if any, of the same; be that as it may, the Court is of the view that allowing a prospective bidder to pay for any advertisement or publication will not give him or her a leverage in public bidding; such act is actually against any bidder's interest because it publicizes the existence of a bidding and persuades competition; on the issue of non-posting of the IAEB on the PhilGeps website, respondent did not show that the Municipality of Looc had an electronic registry with the PhilGeps nor that it had access to the internet; since the viability of posting on the PhilGeps website had not been duly proven during trial, the Court could not postulate on the assumption that the lack of posting on PhilGeps was deliberate; nonetheless, the BAC still fell short in the publication requirement when it failed to advertise the IAEB in a newspaper of general nationwide circulation, or a newspaper that is published nationally; the minutes of the meeting uncovers that the BAC acceded to forego publication in a newspaper of general nationwide circulation because the breakdown per project was below P5,000,000.00; this reveals that the BAC was still ascribing to the posting requirements of R.A. 1594, or otherwise known as Prescribing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for Government Infrastructure Contracts; this has already been superseded by Section 21.2.3 and its IRR-A; yet, the BAC gave an incorrect interpretation of the law because the easing of the posting requirement refers to contracts that are below P5,000,000.00; the SWIP contract was for the entire amount of P9,000,000.00 and it was without regard to the value of the infrastructure project per barangay. (Id.)

Requirement of a valid bid security 
- The basic rule in public bidding that bids should be evaluated on the basis of the required documents submitted before and not after the opening of bids must be strictly observed in order to safeguard a fair, honest and competitive public bidding; a bid security is one of the documents that Section 25.3 and its IRR-A mandates to be included at the opening of bids; a reading of the Bidder's Bond would show that it satisfied the required form of a Bid Security as provided for in Sections 27.2, 27.3 and 28 and its IRR-A which must be: (a) two and a half percent (2½ percent ) of the approved budget for the contract to be bid; (b) callable upon demand issued by a reputable surety or insurance company; (c) in Philippine Peso; and (d) not valid for more than 120 days from the opening of the bid; furthermore, the Bidder's Bond was notarized on November 11, 2007 which contradicts the complaint and the finding of the Ombudsman; hence, the BAC did not err in accepting the bid offer of R.G. Florentino because the bid security shows that it had been issued regularly and for purposes only of securing R.G. Florentino's performance on the SWIP; the Court cannot contradict the BAC's finding on record that a Bid Security was included in the technical proposal during the opening of bids and, thus, upholds its presumption of regularity. (Jomadiao, et al. vs. Arboleda, G.R. 230322, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT UNDER R.A. 8042

Concept 
- Under Article 38 of the Labor Code, Illegal Recruitment is defined as any act of recruitment undertaken by unlicensed or unauthorized persons; with the amendments introduced by R.A. 8042, Illegal Recruitment may be committed even by POEA-licensed recruiters or agencies, who commit any of the prohibited acts under Section 6 of R.A. 8042; the Court notes that R.A. 8042 was amended on March 8, 2010 by R.A. 10022 or An Act Amending R.A. 8042; however, as the acts in this case were committed in 2007-2008, R.A. 8042 is the relevant law that applies; herein accused Rios was charged and convicted of the Illegal Recruitment as penalized under Section 6(m) of the law: Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042 pertains to Illegal Recruitment committed through the failure of any person (whether or not a holder of license or authority) to reimburse documentation and processing expenses incurred by the worker when the deployment did not occur without the worker's fault; this provision also defines Syndicated Illegal Recruitment as being committed by three or more persons and Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale as being committed against three or more persons; Rios was convicted in her capacity as president and general manager of Green Pastures, Inc.; while corporate officers are generally not held personally liable for corporate acts as corporations have separate and distinct legal personality from the persons comprising it, they may be found liable when a specific provision of law makes them personally liable for a corporate action; this is the case here as the last paragraph of Section 6 of R.A. 8042 specifically provides that when Illegal Recruitment is committed by a juridical entity, the persons liable shall be the officers having control, management or direction of the business; Heirs of Fe Tan Uy v. International Exchange Bank, cited. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

Conviction 
- As the main element of false pretense is lacking, the Court acquits Rios of the offense and the penalty therefor is deleted; while it is settled jurisprudence that a person may be separately charged and convicted with Illegal Recruitment under R.A. 8042 and Estafa under Article 315(2), for the same acts, conviction is not automatic as the said crimes have different elements; in the same manner, a conviction for Illegal Recruitment does not automatically result to a conviction for Estafa; the prosecution must still prove the elements of the offense; moreover, in Estafa through deceit or false pretenses, the fraud must have been executed prior to or simultaneous with the commission of the fraud; in this case, Rios and her agency had the qualifications and capacity to deploy workers abroad; the offense she committed was in her failure to reimburse the documentation and processing expenses incurred by the applicants when they were not deployed without their fault; unfortunately for accused Rios, the acquittal for Estafa has no bearing on her sentence as the penalty for Large Scale Illegal Recruitment under Section 7(b) is Life Imprisonment. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

Elements of illegal recruitment through failure to reimburse documentation and processing expenses 
- Based on the language of Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042, the elements of Illegal Recruitment through failure to reimburse documentation and processing expenses, are: 1. The offender (whether or not a POEA-licensed or authorized recruiter or agency), promises or gives the distinct impression that he or she has the capacity to deploy workers for employment abroad; 2. The applicant pays money to the offender in connection with documentation and processing fees for purposes of deployment; 3. The deployment does not take place without the applicant's fault; and 4. The offender fails to reimburse the documentation and processing expenses incurred by the applicant; the Court affirms Rios' conviction for Large Scale Illegal Recruitment under Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042 committed against Tiglao, Dacillo, Milanes, Papio and Custodio; as regards the offense purportedly committed by Rios against complainants De Mata, Arevalo and Agcaoili, the Court holds that Rios' guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt; Section 6(m) of R.A. 8042 criminalizes the failure to reimburse documentation and processing expenses incurred by the applicant in case of non-deployment, and not the failure to deploy, which is covered by a different provision; the law thus makes it incumbent upon recruitment agencies, under pain of criminal sanction, to promptly reimburse applicants when they are not deployed without their fault, as it is the agency itself that knows of the schedule of deployment, persons to be deployed, failure to deploy, and the reasons therefor; the lack of official receipts is not fatal to prove the existence of Illegal Recruitment as long as there is testimony from convincing and credible witnesses, as in this case; the duty to issue official receipts is on the recruitment agency and the recruiter's failure to issue receipts should not be taken against the applicants or claimants. (People vs. Rios, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### INFORMATION

Designation of the offense 
- Going now to the ordinary aggravating circumstance of dwelling; Section 8, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court is in consonance with the constitutional rights of the accused to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him; the purpose is to allow the accused to fully prepare for his defense, precluding surprises during the trial; even if the prosecution has duly proven the presence of any of these circumstances, the Court cannot appreciate the same if they were not alleged in the Information, as in here; that the killing happened in the victim's dwelling was not alleged in the Information; hence, the trial court and the Court of Appeals cannot appreciate dwelling as an aggravating circumstance. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)

Sufficiency of allegations 
- Under Section 6, Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, the Information is sufficient if it contains the full name of the accused, the designation of the offense given by the statute, the acts or omissions constituting the offense, the name of the offended party, the approximate date, as well as the place of the offense; the Information herein complied with these conditions since the qualifying circumstance of "treachery" was specifically alleged in the Information; accused-appellant never claimed that he was deprived of his right to be fully apprised of the nature of the charges against him due to the insufficiency of the Information. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### INTERPLEADER

Filing of 
- Here, since both petitioner and the Cooperative claimed entitlement to the withheld amount of P1,400,000.00, respondent appropriately filed a Complaint for Interpleader with Consignation before Branch 55 of the RTC of Mandaue City; under Section 1, Rule 62 of the Rules of Court, a person may file a special civil action for Interpleader if conflicting claims are made against him/her/it over a subject matter in which he/she/it has no interest; the action is brought against the claimants to compel them to litigate their claims among themselves; the interpleader case before the RTC was filed prior to petitioner's filing of his complaint before the LA; the fact that respondent filed the interpleader case is even an indication of good faith on its part as both petitioner and the Cooperative would be given the right to have their respective claims ventilated before the court; contrarily, the Cooperative who is not a party to the labor complaint before the LA would not have the opportunity to oppose or refute petitioner's unilateral claims therein; in addition, the fact that respondent had consigned the amount of P1,400,000.00 in the RTC where the interpleader case was pending demonstrates the lack of intention on its part to deprive petitioner of such amount, if he was indeed the one entitled to it; given that the disputed sum of P1,400,000.00 pertained to the alleged outstanding loan obligation of petitioner to the Cooperative, it was necessary that all documents pertinent thereto, most especially the loan agreement itself, be presented before the adjudicating body, assessed, and taken into consideration in determining who is entitled to the amount contested. (Tumaodos vs. San Miguel Yamamura Packaging Corporation, G.R. 241865, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### JUDGES

Conduct of 
- Members of the judiciary should conduct themselves in such a manner as to be beyond reproach and suspicion, and free from any appearance of impropriety in their personal behavior, not only in the discharge of their official duties but also in their everyday life; they are strictly mandated to maintain good moral character at all times and to observe irreproachable behavior so as not to outrage public decency. (Baculi vs. Judge Belen, Regional Trial Court, Branch 36, Calamba City, Laguna, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2286 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3291-RTJ], Feb. 12, 2020)

Delay in disposition of cases 
- Because of Judge Santos' overbearing persistence to make the parties settle amicably, he has unduly hampered the proceedings in Special Proceedings No. 1870; in Re: Report on the Judicial Audit conducted in the RTC, Branch 9, Silay City, the Court found Judge Arinday, Jr. guilty of gross inefficiency because of the delay he incurred in disposing of the cases assigned to him and which were already submitted for decision; in two of the cases where he incurred delay, the Court ruled that Judge Arinday was too liberal in granting the parties more than one year to amicably settle their dispute; while the Judge Arinday case involved a delay in the disposition of the cases which were already submitted for decision, the Court finds the pronouncement in the same applicable in determining the reasonableness of the delay in Special Proceedings No. 1870; as correctly pointed out by the OCA, the case went on from January 7, 2010 to December 11, 2012 when the petition was finally withdrawn without it proceeding beyond the pre-trial stage; while a few delays were attributable to the parties due to the absence of counsel, the filing of motion for postponement, and change of counsel, the Court finds that based on Judge Santos' actuations spanning around almost three years, it was mainly his overbearing desire to convince the parties to arrive at an amicable settlement that led to the unreasonable delay; while the Court does not find any bad faith or ill motive on the part of Judge Santos in pushing for an amicable settlement, this should not get in the way of arriving at a just and speedy disposition of the litigants' conflicting claims. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur., A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

Dishonesty 
- Respondent judge is indeed guilty of dishonest conduct; jurisprudence defines dishonesty as "a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity; lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray"; in receiving his monthly allowances despite notice of his suspension by the Court, respondent judge knowingly received money not due to him and in effect defrauded the LGUs concerned of public funds that could have been used for a worthy governmental purpose; under civil service rules, a government employee is not entitled to all monetary benefits including leave credits during the period of suspension; the seriousness of respondent's offense lies in the fact that as a judge, he was "expected to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural rules and to apply them properly in all good faith"; worse, his act of receiving allowances was in clear contravention of this Court's decision suspending him for six (6) months without salary or benefits; We approve the penalty recommended by the OCA since it is settled that "dishonesty, being in the nature of a grave offense, carries the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits except accrued leave credits, and perpetual disqualification from reemployment in the government service." (Baculi vs. Judge Belen, Regional Trial Court, Branch 36, Calamba City, Laguna, A.M. No. RTJ-11-2286 [Formerly OCA IPI No. 09-3291-RTJ], Feb. 12, 2020)

Dismissal of 
- All those who don the judicial robe must always instill in their minds the exhortation that the administration of justice is a mission; judges, from the lowest to the highest levels, are the gems in the vast government bureaucracy, beacon lights looked upon as the embodiments of all what is right, just and proper, the ultimate weapons against injustice and oppression; those who cannot meet the exacting standards of judicial conduct and integrity have no place in the judiciary; the investigating Justice deems it appropriate to recommend the imposition of an administrative penalty of dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits against the respondent judge; it becomes this Tribunal's bounden duty to decree respondent's dismissal from the service. (Neri, et al. vs. Judge Macabaya, Branch 20, Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental, A.M. No. RTJ-16-2475, Feb. 4, 2020 [Formerly A. M. No. 16-07-261-RTC])

Gross ignorance of the law and procedure 
- Gross ignorance of the law is a serious charge under Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC; it requires the judge to perform his/her duty to be acquainted with the basic legal command of law and rules; gross ignorance of the law is the disregard of basic rules and settled jurisprudence; a judge may also be administratively liable if shown to have been motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption in ignoring, contradicting or failing to apply settled law and jurisprudence; Andrada v. Hon. Emmanuel Banzon, cited. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)


- In Department of Justice v. Judge Mislang, the Court explained what constitutes gross ignorance of the law in this wise: Gross ignorance of the law is the disregard of basic rules and settled jurisprudence; a Judge may also be administratively liable if shown to have been motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption in ignoring, contradicting or failing to apply settled law and jurisprudence; though not every judicial error bespeaks ignorance of the law and that, if committed in good faith, does not warrant administrative sanction, the same applies only in cases within the parameters of tolerable misjudgment; where the law is straightforward and the facts so evident, failure to know it or to act as if one does not know it constitutes gross ignorance of the law; a judge is presumed to have acted with regularity and good faith in the performance of judicial functions; but a blatant disregard of the clear and unmistakable provisions of a statute, as well as Supreme Court circulars enjoining their strict compliance, upends this presumption and subjects the magistrate to corresponding administrative sanctions; for liability to attach for ignorance of the law, the assailed order, decision or actuation of the judge in the performance of official duties must not only be found erroneous but, most importantly, it must also be established that he was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or some other like motive; when the inefficiency springs from a failure to recognize such a basic and elemental rule, a law or a principle in the discharge of his functions, a judge is either too incompetent and undeserving of the position and the prestigious title he holds or he is too vicious that the oversight or omission was deliberately done in bad faith and in grave abuse of judicial authority; in both cases, the judge's dismissal will be in order. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur., A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])


- The Court finds Judge Santos guilty of gross ignorance of the law; Judge Santos' gross ignorance of the law lies not so much in the issuance of the Order dated August 7, 2012, which appeared to incorporate a pre-trial order; the Court finds that what appeared as a pre-trial order incorporated in the said Order is not final; in fact, after the pre-trial hearing, Judge Santos issued a Pre-trial Order dated September 4, 2012; however, Judge Santos committed a blatant error when in his Order dated August 7, 2012, he gave the oppositor the privilege of submitting at his option a pre-trial brief; this contravenes the expressed rule under Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court that the filing of the respective pre-trial briefs by the parties at least three days before the date of pre-trial is mandatory; worse, during the pre-trial hearing, Judge Santos expressed that in the absence of oppositor's pre-trial brief, he was treating oppositor's previous submissions to the court, i.e., Opposition, Supplement to the Opposition in lieu of Position Paper, and Compliance, as containing the elements of a pre-trial brief; Judge Santos' act of considering oppositor's submissions as his pre-trial brief is clearly not sanctioned by Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court which mandates the parties to file a pre-trial brief; Section 5 of the same Rule even provides that failure to file the pre-trial brief shall have the same effect as failure to appear at the pre-trial, which in turn will result to allowing the plaintiff to present his evidence ex parte and for the court to render judgment on the basis thereof; thus, when he issued the Pre-Trial Order dated September 4, 2012, Judge Santos disregarded the mandatory nature of the submission of pre-trial briefs considering that the oppositor did not submit his pre-trial brief; Judge Santos' lack of understanding of the rules on pre-trial, constitutes gross ignorance of the law and procedure. (Id.)


- The Court agrees with OCA that the following acts alone do not make Judge Santos' administratively liable: (1) advising the complainant to bring her co-heirs who were residing abroad before the court; (2) not limiting the case to the validity of the Deed of Donation Mortis Causa; and (3) requiring information on the lots which were not subject matter of the petition; these acts are judicial in nature and involved Judge Santos' appreciation of the probate case; in Salvador v. Judge Limsiaco, Jr., as cited in Magdadaro v. Judge Saniel, Jr., the Court ruled: It is settled that a judge's failure to interpret the law or to properly appreciate the evidence presented does not necessarily render him administratively liable; only judicial errors tainted with fraud, dishonesty, gross ignorance, bad faith, or deliberate intent to do an injustice will be administratively sanctioned; to hold otherwise would be to render judicial office untenable, for no one called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment; complainant failed to show that Judge Santos' acts were motivated by bias or bad faith; the Court is also not convinced that such acts constitute gross ignorance of the law; assuming that Judge Santos erred in his appreciation of the case, the remedy of complainant should have been to assail them in an appropriate judicial proceeding where he could have corrected himself or could have been corrected by a higher court. (Id.)

Gross misconduct 
- Respondent Judge is found guilty of violating paragraph 7, Section 8, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court (borrowing money from litigants in cases pending before his court) which is also a gross misconduct constituting violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct; under Section 8 of Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, it is a serious charge to borrow money or property from lawyers and litigants in a case pending before the court; under Section 11(A) of the same rule, an act that violates the Code of Judicial Conduct constitutes gross misconduct, which is also a serious charge; in either instance, a serious charge is punishable by (1) dismissal from the service, forfeiture of all or part of the benefits as the Court may determine, and disqualification from reinstatement or appointment to any public office, including government-owned or controlled corporations, provided, however, that the forfeiture of benefits shall in no case include accrued leave credits; (2) suspension from office without salary and other benefits for more than three but not exceeding six months; or (3) a fine of more than P20,000.00 but not exceeding P40,000.00. (Neri, et al. vs. Judge Macabaya, Branch 20, Regional Trial Court, Cagayan de Oro City, Misamis Oriental, A.M. No. RTJ-16-2475, Feb. 4, 2020 [Formerly A. M. No. 16-07-261-RTC])

Guidelines in the imposition of penalties in administrative matters involving members of the Bench 
- In Boston Finance and Investment Corporation v. Judge Gonzalez, the Court set the following guidelines in the imposition of penalties in administrative matters involving members of the Bench and court personnel, thus: (a) Rule 140 of the Rules of Court shall exclusively govern administrative cases involving judges or justices of the lower courts; if the respondent judge or justice of the lower court is found guilty of multiple offenses under Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, the Court shall impose separate penalties for each violations; and (b) The administrative liability of court personnel (who are not judges or justices of the lower courts) shall be governed by the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel, which incorporates, among others, the civil service laws and rules; if the respondent court personnel is found guilty of multiple administrative offenses, the Court shall impose the penalty corresponding to the most serious charge, and the rest shall be considered as aggravating circumstances; Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC of the Rules of Court, classifies the administrative charges against members of the Bench as serious, less serious and light; the corresponding penalties for a finding of guilt on any of these charges are provided in Section 11, Rule 140, as amended by A.M. No. 01-8-10-SC. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

Propriety 
- As regards Judge Santos' issuance of the Extended Order, he again exceeded the bounds of propriety when he unduly castigated complainant's counsel; Judge Santos should have refrained from using his position to browbeat complainant's counsel just because he did not agree with the latter's position; further, he should have refrained from rendering the Extended Order considering that he already granted the withdrawal of the petition in Special Proceedings No. 1870; thus, there was no longer any occasion to issue the Extended Order. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])


- OCA Circular No. 70-2003 cautions judges "to avoid in chamber sessions without the other party and his counsel present, and to observe prudence at all times in their conduct to the end that they not only act impartially and with propriety but are also perceived to be impartial and improper"; A.M. No. 03-01-09 SC, which was adverted to by Judge Santos to justify his actions, mandates judges to persuade the parties to arrive at a settlement of the dispute; however, it does not give the judge an unbridled license to do this outside the confines of the official proceedings at the risk of putting into question the integrity of the judiciary; while he may have been impelled by good motives in encouraging the parties to arrive at an amicable settlement, his aforementioned acts particularly texting complainant's counsel and convincing the oppositor to amicably settle during their accidental meeting in Naga City, are not part of the court's official proceedings and thus, cast doubt on the integrity and impartiality of the courts; further, his ex parte meeting with complainant and her counsel done inside his chambers is specifically prohibited by OCA Circular No. 70-2003. (Id.)

Violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars 
- In Re: Anonymous Complaints against Judge Bandong, RTC, Br. 59, Lucena City, Quezon Province, the Court explained that to decongest court dockets and enhance access to justice, the Court, through A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA, approved the institutionalization of mediation in the Philippines through court-annexed mediation; under this set of rules, mediatable cases where amicable settlement is possible must be referred by the trial courts to the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC); here, the case involved a petition for the allowance of the Deed of Donation Mortis Causa, which is governed by the rules on the Settlement of Estate of Deceased Person under the Rules of Court; Judge Santos should have referred the case to the PMC but he failed to do so; no reason for him not to refer to the PMC Special Proceedings No. 1870. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

Violation of Supreme Court rules, directives and circulars, simple misconduct, gross inefficiency or undue delay, and gross ignorance of the law 
- Judge Santos committed the following offenses: 1. Failure to refer the case to the PMC as prescribed in A.M. No. 01-10-5-SC-PHILJA; 2. Pressing the parties to enter into an amicable settlement through means that exceeded the bounds of propriety, i.e., texting complainant's counsel, conducting an ex parte meeting with complainant and her counsel inside his chambers, and convincing the oppositor to settle amicably during their accidental meeting in Naga City; 3. Causing undue delay in terminating the preliminary conference amounting to gross inefficiency; 4. Issuing the Extended Order unduly castigating complainant's counsel after the withdrawal of the petition, thereby exceeding the bounds of propriety; and 5. Giving the oppositor the option of submitting his pre-trial brief in contravention of its mandatory nature as stated in Section 6, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court; Judge Santos' first second, and third offenses are less serious charges; specifically, the first offense constitutes a violation of Supreme Court rules, directives, and circulars under Section 9(4), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; the second offense amount to simple misconduct under Section 9(7), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, there being no corrupt or wrongful motive on the part of Judge Santos; the third offense which amounts to gross inefficiency or undue delay falls under Section 9(1), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; applying Section 11, Rule 140, the Court deems it proper to impose a penalty of P12,000.00 each for the first and third offenses; as to the second offense, the Court previously found Judge Santos in A.M. No. MTJ-15-1850 guilty of violating Section 2, Canon 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for initiating a conference among the parties in a pending case for the purpose of settling the cases pending not only before him but also those pending outside his sala; maximum penalty of P20,000.00; as to the fourth charge, the Court finds it as not attended by corrupt or wrongful motive on the part of Judge Santos in issuing the Extended Order; it only amounts to simple misconduct which is a less serious charge under Section 9(7), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court; penalty of P12,000.00; the fifth offense constitutes gross ignorance of the law under Section 8(9), Rule 140 of the Rules of Court which is a serious charge; applying Section 11, Rule 140, the Court deems it proper to impose the penalty of P22,000.00. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

#### JUDGMENTS

Final and executory judgment 
- A judgment sought to be revived is one that is already final and executory; therefore, it is conclusive as to the controversy between the parties up to the time of its rendition; otherwise stated, the new action is an action the purpose of which is not to reexamine and retry issues already decided but to revive the judgment; the cause of action of the petition for revival is the judgment to be revived, i.e., the cause of action is the decision itself and not the merits of the action upon which the judgment sought to be enforced is rendered. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

Immutability of final judgment 
- As a rule, a final judgment is immutable and unalterable; it cannot be disturbed or modified by any court even if the purpose of the alteration is to rectify perceived errors of fact or law; the doctrine of immutability of judgment is for the purpose of avoiding delay in the administration of justice and of putting an end to judicial controversies which cannot drag perpetually; pursuant to this doctrine, courts have the ministerial duty to enforce judgment that already attained finality; there are established exceptions to the foregoing rule, namely: (i) the correction of clerical errors; (ii) presence of nunc pro tunc entries, which cause no prejudice to any party; (iii) void judgment; and, (iv) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the judgment which renders the execution unjust and inequitable; here, none of the foregoing exceptions is applicable; the assailed RTC Order which granted petitioner's application for writ of possession had already become final and executory; the RTC had in fact already issued the corresponding entry of judgment. (HH & Co. Agricultural Corporation vs. Perlas, G.R. 217095, Feb. 12, 2020)


- It is settled that when a decision has acquired finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable; public policy also dictates that when a judgment becomes final, executory, and unappealable, the prevailing party should not be denied the fruits of his or her victory through any form of subterfuge which may be devised by the losing party; "unjustified delay in the enforcement of a judgment sets at naught the role of courts in disposing justiciable controversies with finality". (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Since the Deed of Sale of Residential House was declared null and void in Civil Case No. 12-128721 and affirmed in CA-G.R. CV No. 107254, which decision has attained finality during the pendency of this case, Domingo can no longer claim any right to possess the subject property based on the said deed of sale; this issue has already been settled and can no longer be disturbed in this case; it is a general rule that "judgments by a court of competent jurisdiction, which have attained finality, are not subject to reversal, modification or alteration and are, thus, immutable"; doctrine was extensively discussed in Vios v. Pantango, Jr. (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### JUSTICES

Administrative complaint against Court of Appeals Associate Justices 
- Villamin and Balce point out in their complaint that the two resolutions of the CA were prepared with the same font, paging, and format; they allege that the timing of the resolutions' release of being four (4) days apart connote bias and collusion among the two divisions; such allegation of bias is unfounded, highly speculative and is, clearly, not supported by substantial evidence; the Court reiterates that the filing of administrative complaints or just the threat of the filing of such complaints do subvert and undermine the independence of the Judiciary and its Judges; the Court does not tolerate such unwarranted allegations which spawn as administrative complaints brought against sitting magistrates in respect of their judicial actions; to permit such administrative complaint against members of the second highest court of the land on the basis of such unwarranted allegations is to sanction a clear affront on the independence of the Judiciary; Villamin and Balce are not even parties to Tallado's case pending before the CA; they filed the present administrative complaint as officers of the Volunteer against Crime and Corruption, seeking that the CA Associate Justices inhibit themselves from deciding on the case; it behooves the Court to remind them to maintain due respect for the Courts and the Court's magistrates and not to manifestly exceed their governmental functions by filing clearly unfounded, baseless and unsubstantiated complaints to harass and disrespect the magistrates of the CA. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)


- We address Villamin and Balce's allegation that the CA Associate Justices committed grave abuse of discretion; the present administrative complaint is not the proper judicial remedy to rectify alleged judicial errors of grave abuse of discretion; the appropriate judicial remedy for instances of grave abuse of discretion is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, Section 1 of the Rules of Court; Martinez v. Judge De Vera, cited. (Id.)

Gross incompetence and gross ignorance of the law 
- The CA Associate Justices of the Special 12th and Special 3rd Divisions did not commit gross incompetence and gross ignorance of the law in issuing the aforementioned resolutions against the DILG and Ombudsman; in resolving the propriety of granting Tallado's prayer for preliminary injunction and TRO, the CA Associate Justices of both the Special 12th and Special 3rd Divisions took into account the applicable law and recent jurisprudence, specifically the Court's ruling in Morales v. Court of Appeals; the CA Associate Justices, hence, acted prudently and within the authority of settled jurisprudence and the Rules of Court; Villamin and Balce also failed to present any evidence of malice, bad faith or fraud on the part of the CA Associate Justices to substantiate their bare allegations; considering that the grave penalty of suspension and dismissal of Tallado as Governor of Camarines Norte would unduly result to the premature disenfranchisement of the constituents of the province who voted for Tallado during the last 9 May 2016 elections, the CA Associate Justices acted with diligence and good faith when they issued the injunctive writs in order to maintain the status quo while Tallado's petition of review was pending before the CA. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)

Impeachment 
- In a Resolution, the Court En Banc dropped Associate Justice Rosmari D. Carandang as one of the respondents in the present administrative case; being a member of the Court, she can only be subjected to disciplinary proceedings through impeachment under Section 2, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution; such power to initiate all cases of impeachment is solely lodged with the House of Representatives; in a Resolution dated 7 January 2020, the Court En Banc dropped Associate Justice Mario Lopez as one of the respondents in the present administrative case; Justice Lopez, also a member of the Court is, similarly, subject to impeachment proceedings under the 1987 Constitution and the Court has no jurisdiction over the complaint. (Re: Complaint-Affidavit of Norberto B. Villamin and Eduardo A. Balce Against Associate Justices Ramon M. Bato, Jr., et al., I.P.I. No. 17-256-CA-J, Feb. 18, 2020)

#### LABOR ARBITERS

Jurisdiction over money claims and damages 
- Not all controversies or money claims by an employee against the employer or vice versa fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the LA; with regard to money claims and damages, Article 224 (formerly Article 217) of the Labor Code, as amended, bestows upon the LA original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases filed by workers involving wages, among others, if accompanied by a claim for reinstatement; all claims, except those for Employees Compensation, Social Security, Medicare and maternity benefits, arising from employer-employee relations involving an amount exceeding P5,000.00 regardless of whether accompanied with a claim for reinstatement; and claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from employer-employee relations; as can be gleaned above, the jurisdiction of the LA over money claims and damages is confined to those cases which are either accompanied by a claim for reinstatement or arising from employer-employee relations; although employment relations existed between respondent and petitioner, and the subject of the complaint before the LA was petitioner's money claims against respondent, such money claims did not involve and did not arise out of such employment relationship; petitioner's claims have no "reasonable causal connection" with his employment relationship with respondent; it bears to point out that the case that petitioner filed was neither a complaint for illegal dismissal nor a claim for reinstatement; the principal relief sought by petitioner in his complaint was not the payment of his separation package but the release to him of the withheld amount of P1,400,000.00, to which both he and the Cooperative claimed entitlement; in addition, he also sought the return of the alleged excess deductions made for his 2007 loan in the amount of P279,464.00; given that the disputed amount of P1,400,000.00 and the alleged excess deductions of P279,464.00 both relate to petitioner's alleged indebtedness to the Cooperative and not to respondent, it becomes apparent that the controversy involves debtor-creditor relations between petitioner and the Cooperative, rather than employer-employee relations between respondent and petitioner; evidently, the employer-employee relationship between respondent and petitioner in this case is merely incidental and the principal relief sought by petitioner can be resolved not by reference to the Labor Code or other labor relations statute or a collective bargaining agreement but by the general civil law. (Tumaodos vs. San Miguel Yamamura Packaging Corporation, G.R. 241865, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### LABOR RELATIONS

Recruitment 
- Recruitment, under Article 13(b) of the Labor Code, is defined as any act of canvassing, enlisting, contracting, transporting, utilizing, hiring or procuring workers, and includes referrals, contract services, promising or advertising for employment, locally or abroad, whether for profit or not: Provided, that any person or entity which, in any manner, offers or promises for a fee, employment to two or more persons shall be deemed engaged in recruitment and placement. (People vs. Rios y Catagbui, G.R. 226140, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### LABOR STANDARDS

Payment of 13th month pay 
- With respect to Roxas's claim for 13th month pay, the same is not warranted since Section 3(e) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing P.D. No. 851 expressly exempted from payment of 13th month pay employers of those who are paid on purely commission, boundary, or task basis, and those who are paid a fixed amount for performing a specific work, irrespective of the time consumed in the performance thereof, except where the workers are paid on piece-rate basis in which case the employer shall be covered by this issuance insofar as such workers are concerned. (Roxas vs. Baliwag Transit, Inc. and/or Joselito S. Tengco (owner), G.R. 231859, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### LAND REGISTRATION

Lands of the public domain 
- Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution classifies the lands of public domain as follows: (1) agricultural, (2) forest or timber, (3) mineral lands, and (4) national parks; only agricultural lands may be alienated and disposed of by the State. (Republic vs. San Lorenzo Development Corporation (SLDC), G.R. 220902, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### LAND TITLES

Re-survey of the property – In such cases where the evidence insufficiently indicates the identity of the properties in dispute, this Court has deemed it most equitable and just to remand the case to the trial court for a re-survey of the property under the auspices of a geodetic engineer employed by the Land Management Bureau; here, while two surveys were conducted on the disputed lots, no geodetic engineer from the Land Management Bureau of the DENR was involved in any of them; likewise, it has already been shown that the evidence submitted by the parties is conflicting and inconclusive as to the exact identity of the parcels covered by Tax Declaration Nos. 6727 and 6728; considering that this case has dragged on for almost twenty-five (25) years, this Court deems it just and equitable to settle it once and for all through a definitive and authoritative survey of the disputed property undertaken by the agency with the required expertise on the matter. (Dalida vs. Concepcion Bohol-Zenoni, G.R. 214649, Feb. 26, 2020)

LASCIVIOUS CONDUCT UNDER SECTION 5(b) OF R.A. 7610

Penalty and civil liability 
- The imposable penalty for lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, in Criminal Case No. P-4356, is reclusion temporal medium to reclusion perpetua; the Indeterminate Sentence Law provides that if the crime is punished under a special law, as in this case, the maximum term shall not exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the minimum term prescribed by the same; nonetheless, when the crime is defined in a special law but the penalty therefor is taken from the technical nomenclature in the RPC, the legal effects under the system of penalties native to the Code would necessarily apply to the special law; applying the ISL, accused-appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years and one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum; accused-appellant is further ordered to pay AAA the amounts of Php 50,000.00 as civil indemnity, Php 50,000.00 as moral damages, and Php 50,000.00 as exemplary damages. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### LEASE

Implied contract renewal 
- Based on the terms of the Lease Contract, renewal would be at the option of the lessee; however, after the original Lease Contract had expired, petitioners continued to pay rentals to the lessor; this constitutes an implied lease contract renewal, as the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly found; Dizon v. CA, cited; this Court ruled that implied renewals do not include the option to buy, as it is not germane to the lessee's continued use of the property; moreover, since Overland failed to avail of the option to buy within the stipulated period, it no longer had any right to enforce this option after that period had lapsed; petitioners can only invoke the right to ask for the rescission of the contract if their right to first refusal, as embodied in the original Lease Contract, is included in the implied renewal; based on Article 1643, the lessee's main obligation is to allow the lessee to enjoy the use of the thing leased; without any express contract renewal, this Court cannot presume that both parties agreed to revive all the terms in the previous lease contract. (Mañas, joined by wife Lena Isabelle Y. Mañas vs. Roca, et al., G.R. 208845, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 (R.A. 7160)

Barangay conciliation proceedings 
- The Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the trial court's ruling that petitioners failed to comply with a condition precedent; Section 412 of R.A. 7160 provides: SECTION 412. Conciliation. 
- (a) Pre-condition to Filing of Complaint in Court. 
- No complaint, petition, action, or proceeding involving any matter within the authority of the lupon shall be filed or instituted directly in court or any other government office for adjudication, unless there has been a confrontation between the parties before the lupon chairman or the pangkat, and that no conciliation or settlement has been reached as certified by the lupon secretary or pangkat secretary as attested to by the lupon or pangkat chairman or unless the settlement has been repudiated by the parties thereto; generally, all parties must first undergo barangay conciliation proceedings before filing a complaint in court; none of the exceptions under the law are present in this case. (Mañas, joined by wife Lena Isabelle Y. Mañas vs. Roca, et al., G.R. 208845, Feb. 3, 2020)

Power to assess and collect real estate taxes 
- Under the Real Property Tax Code, the local government unit where the property is located has the authority to assess or appraise the current and fair market value of the property and to collect the taxes due thereon; to determine who has the right to collect taxes from Sps. Braña, it is necessary to determine the location of the property; while the TCTs state that the location is in Pasig, the same cannot be relied in this case because the location of the property is precisely in dispute; the RTC of Antipolo, which has jurisdiction over the boundary dispute case, would be the best forum to determine the precise metes and bounds of the City of Pasig's and the Municipality of Cainta's respective territorial jurisdiction, as well as the extent of each local government unit's authority. (Municipality of Cainta, Rizal vs. Spouses Braña, et al., G.R. 199290, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### LOCAL TAXATION

Payment during boundary dispute 
- Payment of real estate taxes must continue notwithstanding the boundary dispute case; Sps. Braña are ordered to deposit the succeeding payment of real estate taxes due on the subject properties in an account with the Land Bank of the Philippines in escrow for the City of Pasig/the Municipality of Cainta; the proceeds of the same will be released to the local government adjudged by virtue of a final judgment on the issue of territorial jurisdiction over the disputed areas. (Municipality of Cainta, Rizal vs. Spouses Braña, et al., G.R. 199290, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### MIGRANT WORKERS AND OVERSEAS FILIPINOS ACT OF 1995 (R.A. 8042), AS AMENDED BY R.A. 10022

Compulsory life insurance benefit 
- Section 23 of R.A. 10022 provides for the compulsory insurance coverage of migrant workers; respondents become liable for the payment of the compulsory life insurance benefit of USD15,000.00 only when the employee died of an accidental death; inasmuch as the Court had already ruled that Manuel committed suicide, the CA correctly deleted the award of USD15,000.00 by way of life insurance in favor of the petitioner; even assuming that respondents failed to procure a life insurance coverage for Manuel as mandated by R.A. 10022, such failure does not merit the automatic award of the aforementioned sum to the petitioner as the same pertains to the minimum of the life insurance policy coverage to be paid by the insurance company only to qualified beneficiaries and for such causes as specified therein, and is not a penalty or fine to be paid by the manning agency. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

Termination without just, valid or authorized cause 
- Gallego is a seafarer and an overseas worker, whose contract is with a term; he is entitled to security of tenure at least for the period agreed upon in his contract; hence, the provision of Section 10 of R.A. 8042, as amended by R.A. 10022, is applicable; the provision states that termination of overseas employment without just, valid or authorized cause shall entitle the worker to his or her salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract; Gallego had a one-year contract with respondents from December 1999 until December 10, 2000; he was repatriated on August 4, 2000; therefore, he still had an unexpired portion of contract of four months and six days for which he must be paid the value of USD8,182.00 subject to legal interest of twelve percent (12 percent ) per annum from his illegal dismissal on August 4, 2000 to June 30, 2013 and six percent (6 percent ) per annum from July 1, 2013 to the date that this Decision becomes final and executory. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES

Voluntary surrender 
- Voluntary surrender must be considered in the instant case for the reduction of penalty; its requisites, as a mitigating circumstance, are that: (1) the accused has not been actually arrested; (2) the accused surrenders himself to a person in authority or the latter's agent; and (3) the surrender is voluntary. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### MONETARY AWARDS

Legal interest 
- Based on the prevailing jurisprudence, the actual base for the computation of 6 percent  per annum legal interest (the prevailing legal interest prescribed under Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board Circular No. 799, Series of 2013) of the total monetary awards shall be the amount finally adjudged, that is from the finality of this judgment until their full satisfaction. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### MORAL DAMAGES, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES

Award of 
- Since respondents were able to duly prove, and the petitioner had already received the amount of USD670.03 representing Manuel's uncollected salary, the CA correctly deleted the same; petitioner is also not entitled to moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees; the refusal of the respondents to pay the benefits being claimed by the petitioner, and the delay in the eventual release of the last salary of Manuel, did not arise out of bad faith, but brought about by their firm belief of petitioner's lack of entitlement thereto and the merits of their cause; mere failure of the respondents to furnish the petitioner with a copy of the CBA does not establish bad faith; the terms of the employment contract of Manuel had been faithful to the benefits spelled out in the said CBA. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### MOTION TO DISMISS

Failure to state a cause of action 
- Failure to state a cause of action in an initiatory pleading is a ground for the dismissal of a case; Rule 16, Section 1(g) of the Rules of Court states that: SECTION 1. Grounds. - Within the time for but before filing the answer to the complaint or pleading asserting a claim, a motion to dismiss may be made on any of the following grounds: (g) That the pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action; though obvious from the text of the provision, the non-statement of the cause of action must be apparent from the complaint or other initiatory pleading; for this reason, it has been consistently held that in ruling upon a motion to dismiss grounded upon failure to state a cause of action, courts must only consider the facts alleged in the complaint, without reference to matters outside thereof; an early commentary on the Rules of Court describes a motion to dismiss as "the usual, proper, and ordinary method of testing the legal sufficiency of a complaint." (Tocoms Philippines, Inc. vs. Philips Electronics and Lighting, Inc., G.R. 214046, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### MURDER

Commission of 
- Ernie categorically stated that his father was sleeping inside the nipa hut when accused-appellant stabbed him using a "pinuti"; Olipio was lying on his stomach, with his face down, and it was in that position that he was killed by accused-appellant; under such circumstance, there is no doubt that he was not in a position to put up any form of defense against his assailant. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

Elements 
- Under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, the essential elements of murder are: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him; (3) the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248; and (4) the killing is neither parricide nor infanticide. (People vs. Pigar y @ "Biroy," G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020) (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)


- With respect to Criminal Case No. AR-4143, the crime of murder is defined under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC), as amended by R.A. 7659; the following elements must be established: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

Penalty 
- The RTC and CA were both correct in imposing the penalty of reclusion perpetua, together with the accessory penalty provided by law, instead of death considering that the latter penalty has been suspended by R.A. 9346; as to the award of damages, the modifications made by the CA already conform to the latest jurisprudence on the matter; when the crime proven is consummated and the penalty imposed is death but reduced to reclusion perpetua, the civil indemnity and moral damages that should be awarded will each be P100,000.00 and another P100,000.00 for exemplary damages in view of the heinousness of the crime and to set an example; other than treachery which was used to qualify the killing, the special aggravating circumstance of relationship was specifically alleged in the information and the accused-appellant did not deny that he is the victim's brother-in-law, a relative by affinity within the second civil degree. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1997

Income taxation 
- Neither was there any showing that petitioner voluntarily opted to retire so as to treat the amount she received as her retirement pay; not being a retirement pay, it was plain error on the part of the CA to have applied the four conditions under Section 32(B)(6)(a) of the NIRC for tax exemption of retirement benefits; since the amount received by petitioner was separation pay, such is exempt from income tax under Section 32(B)(6)(b) of the NIRC. (Mateo vs. Coca-Cola Bottlers Phils. Inc., G.R. 226064, Feb. 17, 2020)

Non-recognition of gain or loss 
- Respondents anchor their claim for refund on the tax-free exchange provision under Section 40(C)(2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; the requisites for the non-recognition of gain or loss are as follows: (a) the transferee is a corporation; (b) the transferee exchanges its shares of stock for property/ies of the transferor; (c) the transfer is made by a person, acting alone or together with others, not exceeding four persons; and (d) as a result of the exchange the transferor, alone or together with others, not exceeding four, gains control of the transferee. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

Transfer of corporation 
- Section 40(C)(6)(c) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, defines the term "control" as "ownership of stocks in a corporation possessing at least fifty-one percent (51 percent ) of the total voting power of all classes of stocks entitled to vote"; as regards the element of control, the Court, in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Filinvest Dev't. Corp., clarified that it is not necessary that, after the exchange, each of the transferors individually gains control of the transferee corporation; it also does not prohibit instances when the transferor gains further control of the transferee corporation; the element of control is satisfied even if one of the transferors is already owning at least 51 percent  of the shares of the transferee corporation, as long as after the exchange, the transferors, not more than five, collectively increase their equity in the transferee corporation by 51 percent  or more; based on Filinvest, the CIR clearly has no basis to claim that the share swap transaction between respondents and Puregold is not covered by the tax-free exchange as provided in Section 40(C)(2) in relation to Section 40(C)(6)(c) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended; after the exchange, respondents collectively increased their control over Puregold from 66.57 percent  to 75.83 percent ; respondents cannot be held liable for income taxes on the supposed gain which may have resulted from such transfer; the CGT paid by respondents on the subject transfer are considered erroneously paid taxes and must perforce be refunded. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### 2011 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION RULES OF PROCEDURE

Execution of judgments 
- There is no basis for the proposition that petitioners should be deemed to have abandoned their petition before the CA; there is no showing that the payment made by petitioners to Solacito was by virtue of a settlement and in consideration of the termination of the case; on the contrary, records bear out that such payment was made pursuant to a writ of execution; under the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure, the filing of a petition for certiorari with the CA shall not stay the execution of the assailed decision unless a restraining order is issued by the CA. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)

Submission of position paper and reply 
- Petitioners originally argued that Dela Cruz was not terminated as she was merely suspended and that the latter did not report back to work after having been preventively suspended; petitioners raised abandonment as a defense only in their Reply before the CA; such is not allowed; Section 12, Rule V of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure, as amended, proscribes the parties from alleging and/or proving facts and any cause or causes of action not referred or included in the complaint or raised in the parties' position papers. (Every Nation Language Institute (ENLI), et al. vs. Dela Cruz, G.R. 225100, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION (NLRC)

Decision of the NLRC 
- Under the Labor Code, the decision of the NLRC shall become final and executory after 10 days from notice if no appeal is taken therefrom within said period; it is settled that the aggrieved party may still seek reconsideration of the decision of the NLRC, and then seasonably avail itself of the special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65; here, as shown by the records, petitioners timely filed a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC Decision and a petition for certiorari; thus, the NLRC Decision is not yet immutable. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)

Issuance of writs of injunction 
- Article 225(e) of the Labor Code empowers the NLRC "to enjoin or restrain any actual or threatened commission of any or all prohibited or unlawful acts or to require the performance of a particular act in any labor dispute which, if not restrained or performed forthwith, may cause grave or irreparable damage to any party or render ineffectual any decision in favor of such party"; Article 223 provides that decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the NLRC; the NLRC has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases decided by labor arbiters as provided in Article 217(b) of the Labor Code; from the finding of illegal dismissal up to the execution of the monetary award, the jurisdiction of the NLRC is appellate in nature; "Article 218(e) of the Labor Code does not provide blanket authority to the NLRC or any of its divisions to issue writs of injunction, considering that Section 1 of Rule XI of the New Rules of Procedure of the NLRC makes injunction only an ancillary remedy in ordinary labor disputes"; moreover, there is no showing of any urgency or irreparable injury which the complainants might suffer; they are already assured of adequate compensation; "an injunction, as an extraordinary remedy, is not favored in labor law considering that it generally has not proved to be an effective means of settling labor disputes; it has been the policy of the State to encourage the parties to use the non-judicial process of negotiation and compromise, mediation and arbitration." (Del Pilar, et al. vs. Batangas II Electric Cooperative, Inc. (BATELEC II), G.R. 160090, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### NATURALIZATION

Effect 
- Clear from P.D. Nos. 836 and 923 is that the naturalization extends to the alien wife and minor children of the person naturalized upon the wife's showing that she does not suffer from any of the disqualifications under Letter of Instructions No. 270, and that she and her minor children reside permanently in the Philippines at the time of her husband's naturalization; in other words, the only persons to undergo the proceeding before the Special Committee on Naturalization will only be the person naturalized and his wife; the minor children, in the words of Letter of P.D. No. 836 "follow the acquired Filipino citizenship of their mother"; besides, the entries sought to be changed are the nationalities of Lao Kian Ben and Chia Kong Liong as appearing in the certificates of live birth of Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas; therefore, the only relevant issue, at least for the present proceedings, is whether or not Lao Kian Ben and Chia Kong Liong have been issued their Certificates of Naturalization and have taken their Oaths of Allegiance as Filipinos, an issue that has been resolved in the affirmative. (Republic, Represented by the Special Committee on Naturalization (SCN) vs. Chia Lao, et al., G.R. 205218, Feb. 10, 2020)

Types of 
- Naturalization may be either administrative, judicial, or legislative; as the name implies, administrative naturalization is the grant of Filipino citizenship to aliens via administrative proceedings and is currently governed by R.A. 9139; judicial naturalization grants Filipino citizenship through a judicial decree and is governed by Commonwealth Act No. 423 or the Revised Naturalization Law, as amended; lastly, legislative naturalization bestows Filipino citizenship through a statute enacted by Congress; it is undisputed that Winston Brian, Christopher Troy, and Jon Nicholas' father, Lao Kian Ben, applied for naturalization under Letter of Instructions No. 270, and his application was granted under P.D. No. 923; P.D. No. 923 provided for the same rights, privileges, duties, and obligations as well as conditions and effects of naturalization as those provided in P.D. No. 836. (Republic, Represented by the Special Committee on Naturalization (SCN) vs. Chia Lao, et al., G.R. 205218, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### NEW CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT FOR THE PHILIPPINE JUDICIARY

Canon 2 
- The Court finds Judge Santos guilty of violating Sections 1 and 2, Canon 2 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary which provide: CANON 2. INTEGRITY. Integrity is essential not only to the proper discharge of the judicial office but also to the personal demeanor of judges; SECTION 1. Judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer; SEC. 2. The behavior and conduct of judges must reaffirm the people's faith in the integrity of the judiciary; justice must not merely be done but must also be seen to be done; the Court has previously ruled: "It is obvious, therefore, that while judges should possess proficiency in law in order that they can competently construe and enforce the law, it is more important that they should act and behave in such a manner that the parties before them should have confidence in their impartiality"; while the courts are enjoined to make the parties agree on an equitable compromise, the judges' efforts to make the parties agree should be within the bounds of propriety and without the slightest perception of impartiality; from the very beginning, Judge Santos has shown his predisposition to resolve the case by way of an amicable settlement when he directed the parties to propose specific terms and conditions for possible amicable settlement, and constantly cajoled them to do so through his Orders; he did not deny that in his effort to persuade the parties, he committed the said acts. (Elgar vs. Judge Santos, Jr., Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Nabua-Bato, Camarines Sur, A.M. No. MTJ-16-1880, Feb. 4, 2020 [formerly OCA IPI No. 13-2565-MTJ])

#### OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL (OSG)

Powers and functions 
- As to the authority of the Solicitor General to file the complaint for expropriation, we hold that, at the time of the institution of this case in 1980, Section 1(a) of P.D. No. 478, otherwise known as "Defining the Powers and Functions of the Office of the Solicitor General" provides that the Solicitor General has the power to represent the government and its officers before this Court and the CA, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party; moreover, Section 1(k) of P.D. No. 478 likewise provides that the Solicitor General can act and represent the RP and/or the people before any court, tribunal, body or commission in any matter, action or proceedings which, in his opinion, affects the welfare of the people as the ends of justice may require; with the foregoing in mind, we rule that the Solicitor General has the authority to initiate the present expropriation case against the respondents; contrary to the respondents' arguments, the Solicitor General's authority to file the instant complaint for expropriation on September 5, 1980 emanates from the authority provided under P.D. No. 478. (Republic vs. Castillo, et al., G.R. 190453, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### PARTIES TO CIVIL ACTIONS

Indispensable parties 
- An indispensable party is one whose interest will be affected by the court's action in the litigation, and without whom no final determination of the case can be had; the party's interest in the subject matter of the suit and in the relief sought are so inextricably intertwined with the other parties' that his legal presence as a party to the proceeding is an absolute necessity; in his or her absence, there cannot be a resolution of the dispute of the parties before the court which is effective, complete, or equitable; thus, the absence of an indispensable party renders all subsequent actions of the court null and void, for want of authority to act, not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present; in an action for partition, all the co-heirs and persons having an interest in the property are indispensable parties; as such, an action for partition will not lie without the joinder of the said parties. (Agcaoili vs. Mata, G.R. 224414, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Indispensable parties are parties whose legal presence in the proceeding is so necessary that "the action cannot be finally determined" without them because their interests in the matter and in the relief "are so bound up with that of the other parties"; Valeriano and his heirs were not indispensable parties as they no longer stood to be directly benefited or injured by the judgment in the petition for reallocation filed by respondent; Valeriano and his heirs ceased to have an interest in the subject lot after the issuance of the final judgment disqualifying Valeriano as a farmer beneficiary thereof; contrary to petitioners' contention, the failure to implead Valeriano or his heirs (i.e., herein petitioners) did not deprive the DAR-Region VIII, the DARAB Regional Adjudicator, and the DARAB Central Office of jurisdiction over the cases filed before them. (Heirs of Valeriano C. Dela Corta, Sr., namely: Pedro C. Dela Corta, et al. vs. Ralag-Pitogo, represented by Oscar Pitogo, G.R. 226863, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Indispensable parties or parties in interest without whom no final determination can be had of an action, shall be joined either as plaintiffs or defendants; there are two consequences of a finding on appeal that indispensable parties have not been joined: first, all subsequent actions of the lower courts are null and void for lack of jurisdiction; second, the case should be remanded to the trial court for the inclusion of indispensable parties; it is only upon the plaintiff's refusal to comply with an order to join indispensable parties that the case may be dismissed; all subsequent actions of lower courts are void as to both the absent and present parties; the inclusion of an indispensable party is a jurisdictional requirement; both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals found that Diator, the seller in the Deeds of Absolute Sale, and Mahid's estate are indispensable parties, without whom no final determination can be had of the action for annulment filed by petitioners; since this case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the trial court, the second case is not an option. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

Real party in interest 
- An action for the annulment of contracts may be instituted by all who are obliged to it principally or subsidiarily; by the principle of relativity or privity of contracts, contracts take effect only between the parties, their assigns, and heirs; while the principle acknowledges that contractual obligations are transmissible to a party's assigns and heirs, petitioners here do not claim to be heirs of any party to the Deeds of Absolute Sale; it is actually respondent who was party to the sale, not Mahid; therefore, petitioners, not being privy to the Deeds of Absolute Sale, are not the real parties in interest to question their validity. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Generally, every action must be prosecuted or defended in the name of the real party in interest, the one "who stands to be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to the avails of the suit"; to be a real party in interest, one "should appear to be the present real owner of the right sought to be enforced, that is, his or her interest must be a present substantial interest, not a mere expectancy, or a future, contingent, subordinate, or consequential interest"; rationale for such requirement, explained in Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc. v. Cuenca: The purposes of the requirement for the real party in interest prosecuting or defending an action at law are: (a) to prevent the prosecution of actions by persons without any right, title or interest in the case; (b) to require that the actual party entitled to legal relief be the one to prosecute the action; (c) to avoid a multiplicity of suits; and (d) to discourage litigation and keep it within certain bounds, pursuant to sound public policy; considering that all civil actions must be based on a cause of action, the former as the defendant must be allowed to insist upon being opposed by the real party in interest so that he is protected from further suits regarding the same claim; the requirement benefits the defendant because "the defendant can insist upon a plaintiff who will afford him a setup providing good res judicata protection if the struggle is carried through on the merits to the end"; the rule on real party in interest ensures, therefore, that the party with the legal right to sue brings the action, and this interest ends when a judgment involving the nominal plaintiff will protect the defendant from a subsequent identical action. (Id.)


- Petitioners here are not vested with direct and substantial interest in the subject parcels of land; they are not the present real owners of the right sought to be enforced; they claim their interests only as heirs of Mahid, who was not proven to have any right or interest in the parcels of land titled in respondent's name; not being real parties in interest, petitioners cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court; persons having no material interest to protect cannot invoke its jurisdiction as the plaintiff in an action; "nor does a court acquire jurisdiction over a case where the real party in interest is not present or impleaded." (Id.)

#### PETITION FOR RELIEF

Time for filing 
- Another ground relied upon by the CA in dismissing the petition for certiorari is petitioner's failure to explain as to why he did not avail himself of the remedy of an appeal; however, in this particular case wherein the extrinsic fraud alleged by petitioner allegedly resulted in the lack of valid service of summons upon him and consequently, the RTC's lack of jurisdiction over his person, the Court rules that the issues on the availability of an appeal and the propriety of availing oneself of the remedy of petition for relief may only be resolved by looking into the merits of petitioner's arguments; a petition for relief is governed by Section 1, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; it provides: SEC. 1. Petition for relief from judgment, order, or other proceedings. 
- When a judgment or final order is entered, or any other proceeding is thereafter taken against a party in any court through fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence, he may file a petition in such court and in the same case praying that the judgment, order or proceeding be set aside; also, the time for filing a petition for relief is provided under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; the double period provided under Section 3, Rule 38, i.e., (1) 60 days after petitioner learns of the judgment, final order, or other proceeding to be set aside; and (2) not more than six months after such judgment or final order was entered, or such proceeding was taken, is jurisdictional and must be strictly complied with; thus, a petition for relief from judgment filed beyond the reglementary period is dismissed outright; thus, for the filing of a petition for relief to be proper, petitioner must satisfy the following requirements: (1) he or she has no adequate remedy available to him, which is either a motion for new trial or appeal from adverse decisions of the lower court, and he was prevented by fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence from filing such motion or taking the appeal; and (2) he or she must comply with the double period set forth under Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court; however, these rules are not to be taken as absolute; in fact, the Court deems it proper to make an exception in this case; specifically, the above-stated rule will not apply when a petition for relief which is grounded on extrinsic fraud ultimately results in the court's lack of jurisdiction over the defendant, and which consequently makes the judgment rendered by the trial court void. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Petitioner invoked the ground of extrinsic fraud in his petition for relief; he argued that he was deprived of the opportunity to participate in the proceedings before the RTC in Civil Case No. Q-09-65496 by reason of respondents' act of providing the court with an erroneous address where summons may be served on him; the rule is that jurisdiction over a defendant in a civil case is acquired either through service of summons or through voluntary appearance in court and submission to its authority; thus, in the absence of service or when the service of summons upon the person of defendant is defective, the court acquires no jurisdiction over his person, and the judgment rendered against him is null and void; lack of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court in rendering the judgment or final order is either lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or nature of the action, or lack of jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner; the former is a matter of substantive law because statutory law defines the jurisdiction of the courts over the subject matter or nature of the action; the latter is a matter of procedural law, for it involves the service of summons or other processes on the petitioner; a petition for relief which is grounded on extrinsic fraud and which ultimately negates the court's jurisdiction may be filed anytime as long as the action is not barred by laches or estoppel; since Rule 45 of the Rules of Court clearly provides that only questions of law shall be entertained in a petition for review on certiorari, the Court deems it proper to remand the case to the CA for determination of the merits of petitioner's petition for certiorari. (Id.)

#### PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION – STANDARD EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT (POEA-SEC)

Assessment of fitness to work of degree of disability 
- After undergoing a pre-employment medical examination (PEME), petitioner was declared fit to work and was permitted to board MV British Ruby on July 22, 2015; although a PEME is not expected to be an in-depth examination of a seafarer's health, still, it must fulfill its purpose of ascertaining a prospective seafarer's capacity for safely performing tasks at sea; thus, if it concludes that a seafarer, even one with an existing medical condition, is "fit for sea duty," it must, on its face, be taken to mean that the seafarer is well in a position to engage in employment aboard a sea vessel without danger to his health. (Lemoncito vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Philippines, Inc./Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (Isle of Man Ltd.), G.R. 247409, Feb. 3, 2020)


- At the time Solacito filed the complaint, he had no basis to oppose the findings of the company-designated physicians; on this score, the complaint should have already been dismissed at the level of the LA for lack of cause of action; even if the Court gives due course to the complaint despite it having been filed prematurely, Solacito failed to rebut the findings of the company-designated physicians; Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC requires that, after medical repatriation, the company-designated physician must assess the seafarer's fitness to work or the degree of his disability; thereafter, the seafarer may choose his own doctor to dispute the findings of the company-designated physician; if the findings of the company-designated physician and the seafarer's doctor of choice are conflicting, the matter is then referred to a third doctor, whose findings shall be binding on both parties; it was incumbent on Solacito to refer the findings of his own doctor to his employer who would then have had the obligation to commence the process of the selection of the third doctor; jurisprudence is likewise settled that non-referral to a third doctor, whose decision shall be considered as final and binding, constitutes a breach of the POEA-SEC and the assessment of the company-designated physician shall prevail; hence, on the basis of the medical assessment issued by the company-designated physicians, Solacito should be considered able and fit to work, and therefore not entitled to any disability benefit 
- not even a partial disability benefit. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In their final Medical Report, the company-designated doctors stated: On its face, there was no categorical statement that petitioner is fit or unfit to resume his work as a seaman; it simply stated: a) petitioner was previously cleared of his lower respiratory tract infection; b) petitioner's blood pressure is adequately controlled with medications; and c) petitioner was cleared cardiac wise as of July 1, 2016; this assessment is incomplete, nay, inconclusive; Ampo-on v. Reinier Pacific International Shipping, Inc. explains: Upon finding that the seafarer suffers a work-related injury or illness, the employer is obligated to refer the former to a company-designated physician, who has the responsibility to arrive at a definite assessment of the former's fitness or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation; this period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, if the seafarer requires further medical treatment, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this extended period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists; a final and definite disability assessment is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries of the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such; failure of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the prescribed periods and if the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the law steps in to consider the latter's disability as total and permanent. (Lemoncito vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Philippines, Inc./Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (Isle of Man Ltd.), G.R. 247409, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The 2010 POEA-SEC imposes upon the company-designated physician the responsibility to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or degree of disability within a period of 120 days from repatriation; during the said period, the seafarer shall be deemed on temporary total disability and shall receive his basic wage until he is declared fit to work or his temporary disability is acknowledged by the company to be permanent, either partially or totally, as his condition is defined under the POEA-SEC and by applicable Philippine laws; however, if the 120-day period is exceeded and no definitive declaration is made because the seafarer requires further medical attention, then the temporary total disability period may be extended up to a maximum of 240 days, subject to the right of the employer to declare within this period that a permanent partial or total disability already exists; failure of the company-designated physician to arrive at a definite assessment of the seafarer's fitness to work or permanent disability within the prescribed periods, and if the seafarer's medical condition remains unresolved, the law steps in to consider the latter's disability as total and permanent. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The assessment of the company-designated physicians is already binding on Solacito given his premature filing of the complaint and his failure to observe the procedure under Section 20(B)(3) of the POEA-SEC; there is, therefore, no basis to ascribe a disability rating to Solacito; as explained in Caredo v. Maine Marine Philippines, Inc., the determination of the fitness of a seafarer for sea duty is the province of the company-designated physician; it is therefore beyond the courts' authority, nay expertise, to prescribe a disability rating to Solacito in contravention of the valid and binding findings of the company-designated physicians; the records also bear that the company-designated physicians issued said final and definitive medical assessment within 240 days; particularly, the Medical Report was issued after 188 days from his medical repatriation; even the subsequent medical report dated February 10, 2010 of the company-designated physicians was issued within the 240-day window; following the "120/240-day rule" on claims for permanent and total disability benefits, Solacito had no basis to insist that he is suffering from total or partial permanent disability. (Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc. and/or Industria Armamento Meridionale and/or Capt. Amador P. Servillon vs. Solacito, G.R. 217431, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The company-designated physician only issued an interim assessment; the letter did not indicate whether the illness of Rosales was resolved; instead, he was recommended to undergo treatment for approximately six (6) months, depending on his response to the treatment; in Sunit v. OSM Maritime Services, Inc., the Court emphasized: A final and definite disability assessment is necessary in order to truly reflect the true extent of the sickness or injuries of the seafarer and his or her capacity to resume work as such; otherwise, the corresponding disability benefits awarded might not be commensurate with the prolonged effects of the injuries suffered; the inconclusive assessment and Rosales' prolonged illness highlighted that the company-designated physician failed to render a definitive assessment of his disability; thus, there is no need to comply with the third-doctor referral provision under the POEA-SEC; Rosales is considered permanently and totally disabled; Rosales should also be paid his sickness allowance during the period of his treatment with the company-designated physician pursuant to Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC; considering that the company-designated physician failed to make a final diagnosis of Rosales' illness, he is entitled to the maximum allowable sickness allowance equivalent to 120 days; the financial assistance awarded by the CA in the amount of USD5,000.00 is sustained due to respondents' failure to contest the same, even at the Labor Arbiter level. (Rosales vs. Singa Ship Management Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 234914, Feb. 19, 2020)


- There was no medical abandonment on the part of petitioner given that the company-designated physician, in the confidential medical report dated November 3, 2015, had already declared the former to have "already reached his maximum medical improvement," thus, indicating his treatment through curative means to have already ended and that the subsequent check-ups were for the improvement of his physical appearance by means of fitting a scleral shell prosthesis; the said medical report also recommended a Grade 7 disability rating based on the specialist's finding that petitioner's visual prognosis and recovery were poor due to "permanent loss of vision in one eye despite intravenous antibiotic and steroids as well as oral medications given," thus rendering him "unfit for further sea duties"; considering that: (1) in the November 3, 2015 medical report, which was issued within the 120-day treatment period, the company-designated physician already gave petitioner a partial and permanent disability rating of Grade 7, i.e., loss of vision or total blindness in one eye, and declared him to have already reached his maximum medical improvement, rendering him unfit for further sea duties; and (2) during petitioner's subsequent check-ups, the company-designated physician did not find any significant improvement in his condition. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Under Section 20 (A) of the 2010 POEA-SEC, the employer shall be liable for disability benefits only when the seafarer suffers from a work-related injury or illness during the term of his contract; a work-related illness is defined as "any sickness as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this Contract with the conditions set therein satisfied"; while petitioner's diagnosed condition is not among the listed occupational diseases under Section 32-A of the 2010 POEA-SEC, Section 20(A)(4) nonetheless states that "those illnesses not listed in Section 32 of this Contract are disputably presumed as work-related"; thus, the burden is on the employer to disprove the work-relatedness, failing which, the disputable presumption that a particular injury or illness that results in disability is work-related stands; unfortunately, the said presumption was not overturned by TSPI; the Grade 7 disability rating assessment by the company-designated physician negates any claim that the non-listed illness is not work-related. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)

Claim for compensation and benefits 
- In this case, Section 20-B of the 2000 POEA-SEC, the governing POEA-SEC at the time Erispe was employed in 2007 although extended multiple times until his disembarkation on January 24, 2010, is applicable; in situations where the seafarer seeks to claim the compensation and benefits that Section 20-B grants to him, the law requires the seafarer to prove that: "(1) he suffered an illness; (2) he suffered this illness during the term of his employment contract; (3) he complied with the procedures prescribed under Section 20-B; (4) his illness is one of the enumerated occupational disease or that his illness or injury is otherwise work-related; and (5) he complied with the four conditions enumerated under Section 32-A for an occupational disease or a disputably-presumed work-related disease to be compensable." (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Compensation and benefits for injury or illness 
- Respondent employer Hanseatic was not remiss in its duty to provide its injured seafarer with sickness allowance; the company had consistently disbursed to Antolino the appropriate amounts on a monthly basis, in keeping with its duty under Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC, viz.: 3. In addition to the above obligation of the employer to provide medical attention, the seafarer shall also receive sickness allowance from his employer in an amount equivalent to his basic wage computed from the time he signed off until he is declared fit to work or the degree of disability has been assessed by the company-designated physician; the period within which the seafarer shall be entitled to his sickness allowance shall not exceed 120 days; payment of the sickness allowance shall be made on a regular basis, but not less than once a month. (Antolino vs. Hanseatic Shipping Phils. Inc., et al., G.R. 245917, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Section 20(A)(3) of the POEA-SEC provides: Section 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS A. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS. For this purpose, the seafarer shall submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three working days upon his return except when he is physically incapacitated to do so, in which case, a written notice to the agency within the same period is deemed as compliance; in the course of the treatment, the seafarer shall also report regularly to the company-designated physician specifically on the dates as prescribed by the company-designated physician and agreed to by the seafarer; failure of the seafarer to comply with the mandatory reporting requirement shall result in his forfeiture of the right to claim the above benefits; petitioner employee was well-aware that he had a medical examination in Manila scheduled on November 4, 2015; not only would he have been informed of the true status of his injury, but more importantly, the company-designated physician would have been able to assess his condition and declare him fit to work. (Id.)

Condition sine qua non for deployment 
- It is basic that the employment of seafarers and its incidents are governed by the contracts they sign every time they are hired or rehired; these contracts have the force of law between the parties as long as their stipulations are not contrary to law, morals, public order or public policy; every seaman and the vessel owner (directly or represented by a local manning agency) are required to execute the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) as a condition sine qua non to the seafarer's deployment for overseas work; while the relationship between seafarers and their employers are governed by their mutual agreements, "the POEA rules and regulations require that the POEA-SEC, which contains the standard terms and conditions of the seafarers' employment in foreign ocean-going vessels, be integrated in every seafarer's contract." (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Disability compensation 
- There are three (3) instances when a seafarer may be entitled to 100 percent  disability compensation, namely: (1) when the seafarer is declared to have suffered 100 percent  disability; (2) when the seafarer is assessed with disability of at least 50 percent ; and (3) when the seafarer is assessed at below 50 percent  disability, but he or she is certified as permanently unfit for sea service; since petitioner was assessed a Grade 7 disability rating by the company-designated physician, which under the CBA Degree of Disability Rate for Ratings to which he belongs is equivalent to 37.244 or below the 50 percent  disability, and further declared to be unfit for further sea duties as found by the PVA and reflected in the confidential medical report dated November 3, 2015, the CA erred in awarding partial and permanent disability only; petitioner is entitled to 100 percent  disability compensation or in the total amount of USD89,100.00 as provided under the CBA; considering that petitioner was clearly compelled to litigate to enforce what was rightfully due him under the CBA, the award of ten percent (10 percent ) attorney's fees by the PVA was proper, and as such, must be reinstated; in line with prevailing jurisprudence, all monetary awards due petitioner shall earn legal interest at the rate of six percent (6 percent ) per annum from finality of this Decision until fully paid. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)

Duties of the company-designated physician 
- Elburg Shipmanagement Phils., Inc. v. Quiogue, Jr. spells out the duties of the company-designated physician when a seafarer is medically repatriated, viz.: 1. The company-designated physician must issue a final medical assessment on the seafarer's disability grading within a period of 120 days from the time the seafarer reported to him; 2. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days, without any justifiable reason, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total; 3. If the company-designated physician fails to give his assessment within the period of 120 days with a sufficient justification (e.g. seafarer required further medical treatment or seafarer was uncooperative), then the period of diagnosis and treatment shall be extended to 240 days; the employer has the burden to prove that the company-designated physician has sufficient justification to extend the period; and 4. If the company-designated physician still fails to give his assessment within the extended period of 240 days, then the seafarer's disability becomes permanent and total, regardless of any justification. (Antolino vs. Hanseatic Shipping Phils. Inc., et al., G.R. 245917, Feb. 26, 2020)

Overtime pay 
- The correct criterion in determining whether or not sailors are entitled to overtime pay is not whether they were on board and cannot leave ship beyond the regular eight working hours a day, but whether they actually rendered service in excess of said number of hours; the rendition of overtime work and the submission of sufficient proof that said work was actually performed are conditions to be satisfied before a seafarer could be entitled to overtime pay; no proof was presented by Erispe that he actually performed overtime work while onboard; thus, there was no basis for the award thereof; also, in the case of an illegally dismissed overseas worker, entitlement to fixed overtime pay equivalent to the unexpired portion of the latter's contract must first be established, otherwise the same cannot be allowed. (Loadstar International Shipping, Inc., et al. vs. Erispe, Jr., G.R. 221227, Feb. 19, 2020)

Permanent total disability compensation 
- Since petitioner was declared by no less than his attending specialist to be unfit for further sea service due to permanent loss of vision in his left eye, the Court finds his resulting disability to be not only partial and permanent as ruled by the CA, but rather total and permanent as correctly found by the PVA; in disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, but rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of one's earning capacity; total disability refers to an employee's inability to perform his or her usual work; it does not require total paralysis or complete helplessness; permanent disability, on the other hand, is a worker's inability to perform his job for more than 120 days or 240 days, if the seafarer required further medical attention justifying the extension of the temporary total disability period, regardless of whether or not he loses the use of any part of his body. (Teodoro vs. Teekay Shipping Philippines, Inc., G.R. 244721, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Without a valid final and definitive assessment from the company-designated doctors within the 120/240-day period, as in this case, the law already steps in to consider a seafarer's disability as total and permanent; by operation of law, petitioner is already totally and permanently disabled; besides, jurisprudence grants permanent total disability compensation to seafarers, who suffered from either cardiovascular diseases or hypertension, and were under the treatment of or even issued fit-to-work certifications by company-designated doctors beyond 120 or 240 days from their repatriation. (Lemoncito vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Philippines, Inc./Bernard Schulte Shipmanagement (Isle of Man Ltd.), G.R. 247409, Feb. 3, 2020)

Termination of seafarer's contract 
- Under Section 23 of the POEA-SEC, an employer may terminate a seafarer's contract due to sale of ship, lay-up or discontinuance of voyage; for such termination to be valid, the same provision states that the seafarer shall immediately be paid his earned wages, repatriation costs and one-month basic pay as termination pay, unless arrangements have been made for the seafarer to join another ship belonging to the same principal to complete his contract, and in the latter case, the seafarer shall be entitled to his basic wages until the date of joining the other ship; applying the foregoing provision and labor principles, respondents have the burden of proving the observance of due process and compliance to Section 23 of the POEA-SEC to consider the dismissal of Gallego valid. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)

Work-related illness 
- Viral Hepatitis is listed as an occupational disease under the POEA-SEC that is work-related and compensable when contracted during the term of the employee's contract; it was established through the letter of the company-designated physician that the illness of Rosales, chronic Hepatitis C, "is acquired by exposure to infected blood through needle or instruments, blood transfusion, vertical transmission from mother to unborn child, sexual intercourse"; while the viral Hepatitis considered occupational disease in the POEA-SEC is limited to those "spread through ingestion of water, milk, or other foods contaminated with hepatitis virus," Section 20(A)(4) of the POEA-SEC provides that even those illnesses not listed in Section 32 are still disputably presumed work-related; despite not being a listed illness in Section 32, Chronic Hepatitis C is disputably presumed to be work-related; the conditions for compensability in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC also apply to non-listed illnesses given that: (1) the legal presumption under Section 20(B)(4) accorded to the latter is limited only to "work-relatedness;" and (2) for its compensability, a reasonable connection between the nature of work on board the vessel and the illness contracted or aggravated must be shown; while Chronic Hepatitis C is not a listed occupational disease, the same standards laid down in Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC should be applied in determining the compensability of Rosales' illness; considering the nature of his work – where he had to clean rooms, handle, segregate, and dispose waste materials including syringes and other bio-medical wastes – and the timeline leading to the diagnosis of illness, it can be safely concluded that he contracted Chronic Hepatitis C while on board Queen Mary 2; thus, the company-designated physician's declaration that Rosales' Hepatitis C infection is not work-related is erroneous; with regard to his fatty liver, the illness is work-related too; fatty liver (Steatosis) is common in people afflicted with Hepatitis C as a consequence of viral infection; considering that his fatty liver is attributed to his Chronic Hepatitis C illness, it is also work-related. (Rosales vs. Singa Ship Management Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 234914, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### PLEA BARGAINING

DOJ Circular No. 27 and A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC 
- A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC is a rule of procedure established pursuant to the rule-making power of the Supreme Court that serves as a framework and guide to the trial courts in plea bargaining violations of R.A. 9165; a plea bargain still requires mutual agreement of the parties and remains subject to the approval of the court; the acceptance of an offer to plead guilty to a lesser offense is not demandable by the accused as a matter of right but is a matter addressed entirely to the sound discretion of the trial court; Section 2, Rule 116 of the Rules of Court expressly states: Sec. 2. Plea of guilty to a lesser offense. – At arraignment, the accused, with the consent of the offended party and the prosecutor, may be allowed by the trial court to plead guilty to a lesser offense which is necessarily included in the offense charged; after arraignment but before trial, the accused may still be allowed to plead guilty to said lesser offense after withdrawing his pleas of not guilty; no amendment of the complaint or information is necessary; the use of the word "may" signifies that the trial court has discretion whether to allow the accused to make a plea of guilty to a lesser offense; it is also essential that the lesser offense is necessarily included in the offense charged; taking into consideration the requirements in pleading guilty to a lesser offense, We find it proper to treat the refusal of the prosecution to adopt the acceptable plea bargain for the charge of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs provided in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC as a continuing objection that should be resolved by the RTC; this harmonizes the constitutional provision on the rule making power of the Court under the Constitution and the nature of plea bargaining in Dangerous Drugs cases; DOJ Circular No. 27 did not repeal, alter, or modify the Plea Bargaining Framework in A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC; the Circular merely serves as an internal guideline for prosecutors to observe before they may give their consent to proposed plea bargains. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)

Nature 
- Plea bargaining was required during pre-trial conference in all criminal cases cognizable by the Municipal Trial Court, the Municipal Circuit Trial Court, the Metropolitan Trial Court, the RTC, and the Sandiganbayan with the objective of promoting fair and expeditious trial; plea bargaining is a vital component of restorative justice; in giving preference to working out a mutually satisfactory resolution of the case sanctioned by the court over lengthy and protracted trial, both the state and the accused benefit; the plea bargaining mechanism affords speedy disposal and cost efficiency which significantly contribute to the restorative justice process; by shortening the time between the original charge and the disposition, it enhances the rehabilitative prospects and redeeming characteristics of the offender when the trial court approves the plea bargain to a lesser offense; the aim is to rehabilitate, not punish, drug offenders; while it is the government's mandate to "pursue an intensive and unrelenting campaign against the trafficking and use of dangerous drugs and other similar substances," it is equally important to highlight "the policy of the State to provide effective mechanisms or measures to re-integrate into society individuals who have fallen victims to drug abuse or dangerous drug dependence"; there are sufficient justifications to deviate from the strict application of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts. (Sayre @ "Inol" vs. Hon. Xenos, in his capacity as the Presiding Judge of Regional Trial Court of Panabo City, Davao del Norte, Branch 34, et al., G.R. Nos. 244413, 244415-16, Feb. 18, 2020)

#### PLEADINGS

Relief 
- The records do not show that respondents prayed for the conduct of a reinvestigation in their motion for reconsideration; jurisprudence dictates that the courts cannot grant a relief not prayed for in the pleadings or in excess of what is being sought by a party to a case; rationale for this rule, explained in Bucal v. Bucal, citing Development Bank of the Philippines v. Teston; the fundamental purpose of the requirement that allegations of a complaint must provide the measure of recovery is to prevent surprise to the defendant; this protection against surprises granted to defendants should also be available to petitioners; both parties to a suit are entitled to due process against unforeseen and arbitrary judgments; the very essence of due process is "the sporting idea of fair play" which forbids the grant of relief on matters where a party to the suit was not given an opportunity to be heard; the trial court gravely abused its discretion when it issued the assailed September Order. (Social Security System vs. Seno, Jr., et al., G.R. 183478, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### POSSESSION

Actual and constructive possession 
- Possession, under the law, includes not only actual possession, but also constructive possession; actual possession exists when the drug is in the immediate physical possession or control of the accused; constructive possession, on the other hand, exists when the drug is under the dominion and control of the accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control over the place where it is found; exclusive possession or control is not necessary; the accused cannot avoid conviction if his right to exercise control and dominion over the place where the contraband is located, is shared with another; in possession of illicit drugs cases, ownership is inconsequential; mere possession of the illicit drugs is malum prohibitum and the burden of proof is upon the accused to prove that they have a permit or clearance to possess the prohibited drugs. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

Concept 
- Preliminary injunctions are issued to preserve the status quo, "the last actual, peaceful, and uncontested status that precedes the actual controversy, that which is existing at the time of the filing of the case"; here, the injunctive relief was sought to bar the implementation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolutions, which would have significantly affected the exercise of power of the municipalities in conflict; contrary to petitioner's actuations, there need not be a determination of whether the March 26, 1962 Decision had attained finality; the trial court did not pass upon its finality when it determined that the writ of preliminary injunction should be issued; respondent satisfactorily showed that its circumstances merited the temporary injunctive relief, lest the reliefs it prayed for in its main Petition be rendered moot when the case has been heard on the merits. (Municipality of Famy, Laguna vs. Municipality of Siniloan, Laguna, G.R. 203806, Feb. 10, 2020)

Writ of 
- Courts are given wide discretion in granting a writ of preliminary injunction; however, this discretion is with limit and must be exercised with great caution; in the absence of grave abuse of discretion, this Court shall not intervene in their exercise of discretion in injunctive matters; in Ong Lay Hin v. Court of Appeals, this Court defined grave abuse of discretion as: the "arbitrary or despotic exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or a capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or a refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law." (Municipality of Famy, Laguna vs. Municipality of Siniloan, Laguna, G.R. 203806, Feb. 10, 2020)


- In Spouses Nisce v. Equitable PCI Bank, this Court explained that litigants applying for injunctive relief must exhibit their "present and unmistakable right to be protected; that the facts against which injunction is directed violate such right; and there is a special and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damages"; here, as an incident to its Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition, respondent prayed for injunctive relief to curtail the implementation of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolutions, which had declared Barangays Kapatalan and Liyang to be under petitioner's jurisdiction; a perusal of the records reveals that respondent sufficiently alleged and substantiated its clear legal right sought to be protected through the writ of preliminary injunction; respondent, who had in its favor a March 26, 1962 Decision declaring its jurisdiction over the barangays, stood to suffer irreparable injury through the Sangguniang Panlalawigan Resolutions. (Id.)


- Injunction should not be issued "if there is no clear legal right materially and substantially breached from a prima facie evaluation of the evidence of the complainant"; parties seeking injunction must present evidence to demonstrate their justification for the relief pending final judgment; the evidence need not be complete and conclusive proof; prima facie evidence suffices: It is crystal clear that at the hearing for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, mere prima facie evidence is needed to establish the applicant's rights or interests in the subject matter of the main action; an applicant for a writ is required only to show that he has an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in his complaint. (Id.)


- Rule 58, Section 1 of the Rules of Court defines preliminary injunction; otherwise stated, a writ of preliminary injunction is: an ancillary and interlocutory order issued as a result of an impartial determination of the context of both parties; it entails a procedure for the judge to assess whether the reliefs prayed for by the complainant will be rendered moot simply as a result of the parties' having to go through the full requirements of a case being fully heard on its merits; preliminary injunction may either be prohibitory, when it bars an act, or mandatory, when it requires the performance of a particular act; as an interlocutory order, it is a provisional remedy, temporary in nature; it is ancillary, an incident adjunct to a main action; preliminary injunction is "subject to the final disposition of the principal action"; the trial court's order issuing the injunction is neither a judgment on the merits nor a final disposition of the case. (Id.)


- Rule 58, Section 3 of the Rules of Court enumerates the grounds when a writ of preliminary injunction is proper: Jurisprudence provides that the following must be proven for a writ of preliminary injunction to be issued: (1) The applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right to be protected, that is a right in esse; (2) There is a material and substantial invasion of such right; (3) There is an urgent need for the writ to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and (4) No other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury. (Id.)

#### PRESUMPTIONS

Non-compliance with the chain of custody rule 
- The prosecution's failure to justify its non-compliance with the requirements found in Section 21, specifically, the presence of the three required witnesses during the actual inventory of the seized items, is fatal to their case; it is mandated by no less than the Constitution that an accused in a criminal case shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; in People v. Hilario, the Court ruled that: the prosecution bears the burden to overcome such presumption; if the prosecution fails to discharge this burden, the accused deserves a judgment of acquittal; on the other hand, if the existence of proof beyond reasonable doubt is established by the prosecution, the accused gets a guilty verdict; in order to merit conviction, the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of evidence presented by the defense; absent faithful compliance with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165, which is primarily intended to, first, preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items in drugs cases, and second, to safeguard accused persons from unfounded and unjust convictions, an acquittal becomes the proper recourse. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

Presumption of regular performance by police officers of their official duties 
- The prosecution cannot simply invoke the saving clause found in Section 21 
- that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items have been preserved 
- without justifying their failure to comply with the requirements stated therein; even the presumption as to the regularity in the performance by police officers of their official duties cannot prevail when there has been a clear and deliberate disregard of procedural safeguards by the police officers themselves; People v. Umipang is instructive on the matter: Minor deviation from the procedure under R.A. 9165 would not automatically exonerate an accused from the crimes of which he or she was convicted; this is especially true when the lapses in procedure were "recognized and explained in terms of justifiable grounds"; there must also be a showing "that the police officers intended to comply with the procedure but were thwarted by some justifiable consideration/reason"; however, when there is gross disregard of the procedural safeguards prescribed in the substantive law (R.A. 9165), serious uncertainty is generated about the identity of the seized items that the prosecution presented in evidence; this uncertainty cannot be remedied by simply invoking the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties, for a gross, systematic, or deliberate disregard of the procedural safeguards effectively produces an irregularity in the performance of official duties. (People vs. Kamad, G.R. 238174, Feb. 05, 2020)

Presumption of regularity and authenticity of notarized deeds 
- Respondent's titles were derived from the notarized Deeds of Absolute Sale between her and the seller, which are presumed valid, regular, and authentic; notarized deeds of absolute sale such as these enjoy a presumption of regularity and authenticity absent "strong, complete, and conclusive proof of its falsity"; since they assail the genuineness of the Deeds, petitioners must prove their allegation of falsity with clear, strong, and conclusive evidence; here, both the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals did not give merit to petitioners' allegation of falsity of the Deeds of Absolute Sale; the documentary evidence submitted by petitioners 
- an Acknowledgment Receipt issued by the seller to Mahid indicating P2 million as partial payment for the properties, the loan obtained by Mahid from one Engr. Cosain Dalidig, and various official receipts of a store in Wao 
- are purely immaterial and do not show any link to the two (2) Deeds of Absolute Sale between respondent and the seller. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS

Requirements 
- It is an elementary rule that when a party files any pleading or motion, a copy thereof must be served on the adverse party; for the essence of procedural due process is embodied in the basic requirement of notice and a real opportunity to be heard; an adverse party must be given an opportunity to be heard through his/her comment, before the case can be presented for adjudication. (Ganal, et al. vs. Alpuerto, et al., G.R. 205194, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### PROCEDURAL RULES

Interpretation 
- In a plethora of cases, the Court relaxed the application of procedural rules; a strict application of the rules should not amount to straight-jacketing the administration of justice and that the principles of justice and equity must not be sacrificed for a stern application of the rules of procedure; thus, when the strict and rigid application of procedural rules would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice, they must always be eschewed; in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, the Court finds it proper to resolve the case on the merits. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)


- It is settled that "procedural rules are designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases; courts and litigants alike are enjoined to abide strictly by the rules"; however, it is not novel for courts to brush aside technicalities in the interest of substantial justice; in Malixi v. Baltazar, the Court recounted the long line of jurisprudence consistently supporting the relaxation of procedural rules if strict adherence thereto would only frustrate rather than promote justice; while the Court has entertained petitions in the past despite the presence of procedural lapses, the Court has restricted its liberality only to exceptional circumstances; to warrant relaxation of the rules, the erring party must: (a) show reasonable cause justifying its noncompliance with the rules, (b) convince the Court that the outright dismissal of the petition would defeat the administration of substantive justice, and (c) offer proof of at least a reasonable attempt at compliance therewith; "the desired leniency cannot be accorded absent valid and compelling reasons for such a procedural lapse." (Kabalikat Para sa Maunlad na Buhay, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. Nos. 217530-31, Feb. 10, 2020) 


- Procedural rules should not be belittled or dismissed because they are tools designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases; court procedure should be strictly followed; they may be relaxed for the most persuasive of reasons, especially, to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the prescribed procedure; no reason to dismiss Gallego's petition because he has sufficiently complied with the requirements under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; We took note and accepted Gallego's compliance of the lacking contents in his petition; respondents' position on procedural lapses will not prosper. (Gallego vs. Wallem Maritime Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 216440, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court has ruled against the dismissal of appeals based solely on technicalities, especially so when the appellant had substantially complied with the formal requirements; specifically, the Court ruled that subsequent and substantial compliance may call for the relaxation of procedural rules. (Duremdes vs. Jorilla, et. al., G.R. 234491, Feb. 26, 2020)


- There is no dispute that Lukban belatedly filed his MR before the CA; nevertheless, there is merit to his contention that the CA should have granted his MR; time and again, the Court has relaxed the observance of procedural rules to advance substantial justice; in PNB v. Yeung, although petitioner's MR of the CA decision therein was filed out of time, the Court still gave due course to the petition in view of the substantial merits of the case; the relaxation of procedural rules in the interest of substantial justice even finds application in judgments that are already final and executory, as in Barnes v. Padilla; the instances for relaxation of the rules are present in this case; the Court opts for a liberal application of the procedural rules especially considering that the substantial merits of the case warrant its review by the Court. (Lukban vs. Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, G.R. 238563, Feb. 12, 2020)

Non-compliance to the rules 
- Procedural rules are in place to ensure the orderly, just, and speedy dispensation of cases; they are tools designed to facilitate, not hinder, the attainment of justice; thus, technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice, warrants scant consideration; therefore, litigants deserve no sympathy when they exploit the rules and resort to technicalities in order to justify wanton disregard for the orders of a court. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### PROPERTY

Acquisition of possession 
- The Court observes that Atty. Bensi was in possession of the disputed property when the complainants tried to enter and take it; complainants believed that they were the lawful owners of the property on the strength of a Partial Summary Judgment which awarded the property to Lucille's now deceased parents; nevertheless, even if the complainants are indeed the lawful owners of the disputed property, they should not have taken the law into their own hands through force; what the complainants should have done was to invoke the aid of the proper court in lawfully taking possession of the property; Article 536 of the Civil Code provides: Art. 536. In no case may possession be acquired through force or intimidation as long as there is a possessor who objects thereto; he who believes that he has an action or a right to deprive another of the holding of a thing, must invoke the aid of the competent court, if the holder should refuse to deliver the thing. (Spouses Nocuenca vs. Atty. Bensi, A.C. No. 12609, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### PROPERTY REGISTRATION DECREE (P.D. NO. 1529)

Land classification 
- In Republic of the Philippines v. T.A.N Properties, Inc., the Court ruled that it is not enough for the CENRO or the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources (PENRO) to certify that the land applied for is alienable and disposable; the Court has consistently ruled that the applicant must present a copy of the original classification approved by the DENR Secretary and certified as a true copy of the original land classification approved by the legal custodian of such official records to establish that the land for registration is alienable and disposable; in ruling in this wise, the Court explained that the CENRO or the PENRO are not the official repository or legal custodian of the issuances of the DENR Secretary declaring public lands as alienable and disposable; the certifications they issue relating to the character of the land cannot be considered prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein; here, the required copy of original land classification of the subject lands was not presented; both the RTC and the CA merely relied on the Certifications issued by the CENRO and the Regional Technical Director of the Lands Management Services of the DENR in ruling that the alienable and disposable nature of the subject lands was established; clearly, this is not sufficient to prove the alienability and disposability of the subject lands. (Republic vs. San Lorenzo Development Corporation (SLDC), G.R. 220902, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The fact that the alienable and disposable nature of the subject lands was not contested by the Republic in its appeal before the Court, does not have the effect of impliedly admitting, much less proving, that the subject lands are alienable and disposable; the alienability and disposability of land are not among the matters that can be established by mere admissions or even by mere agreement of the parties; the law and jurisprudence provide stringent requirements to prove such fact; this is so because no less than the Constitution, provides for the doctrine that all lands of the public domain belong to the State, which is the source of any asserted right to ownership of land; as such, the courts are not only empowered, but in fact duty-bound, to ensure that such ownership of the State is duly protected by the proper observance of the rules and requirements on land registration; the alienable and disposable character of the land must be proven by clear and incontrovertible evidence to overcome the presumption of State ownership of the lands of public domain under the Regalian doctrine; the burden of proof in overcoming such presumption is upon the person applying for registration. (Id.)

#### PUBLIC OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES

Conduct 
- What is material in this case is the fact that without his marriage being first dissolved, he lived with another woman not his wife, and with whom he found another family; all government officials and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives; the good of the service and the degree of morality which every official and employee in the public service must observe, if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the Government in the enforcement of the law, demand that no untoward conduct on his part, affecting morality, integrity and efficiency while holding office should be left without proper and commensurate sanction, all attendant circumstances taken into account. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct 
- Garra is also guilty of Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct as defined under Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 15, Series of 2010, which provides: Section 1. Definition of Disgraceful and Immoral conduct - Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct refers to an act which violates the basic norm of decency, morality and decorum abhorred and condemned by the society; it refers to conduct which is willful, flagrant or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to the opinions of the good and respectable members of the community; the same Circular highlights that "disgraceful and immoral conduct may be committed in a scandalous or discreet manner, within or out of the workplace"; this Court has held in a number of cases that a man having an illicit relationship with a woman not his wife is within the purview of "disgraceful and immoral conduct" under Civil Service Laws. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct, Violation of Reasonable Rules and Regulations, and Simple Dishonesty 
- According to Section 46 B.3, Rule 10 of the RRACCS, Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct is a grave offense punishable by suspension from service for a period of six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year for the first offense, and dismissal for the second offense; Section 46 F.3, Rule 10 of the same rules classifies Violation of Reasonable Rules and Regulations as a light offense, which is punishable by reprimand for the first offense; suspension of one (1) to thirty (30) days for the second offense; and dismissal from the service for the third offense; under CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, Simple Dishonesty is punishable by suspension of one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense; six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year suspension for the second offense; and dismissal for the third offense. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

Dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service 
- Dishonesty has been defined as the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray and an intent to violate the truth; for dishonesty to be considered serious, thus warranting the penalty of dismissal from service, the presence of any one of the following attendant circumstances must be present: (1) The dishonest act caused serious damage and grave prejudice to the Government; (2) The respondent gravely abused his authority in order to commit the dishonest act; (3) Where the respondent is an accountable officer, the dishonest act directly involves property, accountable forms or money for which he is directly accountable and the respondent shows an intent to commit material gain, graft and corruption; (4) The dishonest act exhibits moral depravity on the part of the respondent; (5) The respondent employed fraud and/or falsification of official documents in the commission of the dishonest act related to his/her employment; (6) The dishonest act was committed several times or in various occasions; (7) The dishonest act involves a Civil Service examination irregularity or fake Civil Service eligibility such as, but not limited to impersonation, cheating and use of crib sheets; (8) Other analogous circumstances; dishonesty – like bad faith 
- is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention; in evaluating such intention, the following are some considerations: the facts and circumstances giving rise to the act committed; his state of mind at the time the offense was committed; the time he might have had at his disposal for the purpose of meditating on the consequences of his act; and the degree of reasoning he could have had at that moment; as for what specific acts constitute conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, there is no concrete description of such under the Civil Service law and rules; jurisprudence instructs that for an act to constitute such an administrative offense, it need not be related to or connected with the public officer's official functions; what is essential is that the questioned conduct tarnishes the image and integrity of his public office. (Lukban vs. Ombudsman Carpio-Morales, G.R. 238563, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Lukban was found to have committed serious dishonesty and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service by his having signed the "Noted by" portion of the Inspection Report Form without verifying the accuracy and truthfulness thereof, thereby facilitating the release of funds for the payment of supposedly brand-new helicopters which turned out to be secondhand units; however, a review of the functions and duties of his office leads the Court to conclude otherwise; at the time material to this case, Lukban was the Chief of the Management Division of the PNP Directorate for Comptrollership; based on the foregoing, which has not been disputed, Lukban's official duties revolve only around accounting and fund or resource management; his claim that the function of verifying the LPOH specifications belonged to different departments of the PNP is, in fact, already recognized by jurisprudence; Field Investigation Office v. Piano, cited; thus, the Court gives credence to Lukban's claim that he merely relied on the IAC Resolution as regards the compliance of the LPOHs with the NAPOLCOM specifications when he affixed his signature on the Inspection Report Form under the portion of "Noted by"; borrowing the language of the Court in Field Investigation Office v. Piano, it is the IAC that has the responsibility of inspecting the deliveries to make sure they conform to the quantity and the approved technical specifications in the supply contract and the purchase order and to accept or reject the same, and it is only after the IAC's final acceptance of the items delivered can the supplier be paid by the PNP, so that it is the IAC Resolution that constitutes "the final act for the acceptance of these helicopters for the use of the PNP, and which was the basis for the PNP to pay the price of brand new helicopters for the delivered second-hand items"; it is the considered view of the Court that Lukban cannot be held liable for serious dishonesty or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service; dishonesty – like bad faith – is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but a question of intention; Lukban's acts do not show any disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray, nor any intent to violate the truth. (Id.)

Misconduct 
- Misconduct is a transgression of some established or definite rule of action; more particularly, it is an unlawful behavior by the public officer; there is evidence to support the claim that Tabasa committed an unlawful behavior against Angco; a careful perusal of the records of the case would show that there is no dispute that Tabasa deliberately touched the knee of Angco in jest and that this act was unsolicited; by his conduct, Tabasa violated the yardstick of public service imposed under Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution which enunciates the state policy of promoting a high standard of ethics and utmost responsibility in the public service; as a public servant, he is bound by the ethical standards demanded by R.A. 6713 on professionalism, justness, and sincerity; he should at all times respect the rights of others, and shall refrain from doing acts contrary to law, good morals, good customs, public policy, public order, public safety and public interest; unsolicited physical contact, even if done in jest, has no place in the workplace, especially in the government service. (Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang (PBS-RTVM) vs. Tabasa, G.R. 234624, Feb. 26, 2020)

Simple dishonesty 
- CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 (Rules on the Administrative Offense of Dishonesty) provides for different circumstances when Dishonesty is considered Serious, Less Serious, or Simple; Section 5 of CSC Resolution No. 06-0538 provides that the presence of any of the following attendant circumstances in the commission of the dishonest act constitutes Simple Dishonesty: "(a) The dishonest act did not cause damage or prejudice to the government; (b) The dishonest act had no direct relation to or does not involve the duties and responsibilities of the respondent; (c) In falsification of any official document, where the information falsified is not related to his/her employment; (d) That the dishonest act did not result in any gain or benefit to the offender; and (e) Other analogous circumstances." (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)


- It is undisputed even by Garra that he remains legally married to Osbual; in this connection, we agree with the OAS that his deliberate omission of this fact in his SALNs for several years constitutes Dishonesty; "dishonesty has been defined as the concealment or distortion of truth, which shows lack of integrity or a disposition to defraud, cheat, deceive, or betray and an intent to violate the truth"; applying CSC Resolution No. 06-0538, while Garra's misrepresentation or omission of his marital status in his SALNs can be considered as a dishonest act, we agree with the OAS that such act constitutes Simple Dishonesty as the same did not cause damage or prejudice to the government and had no direct relation to or did not involve the duties and responsibilities of Garra as staff driver; the same is true with the misrepresentation he committed, where the information omitted is not related to his employment. (Id.)


- Petitioners are charged for the less grave offense of simple neglect of duty, which is the failure to give attention to a task, or the disregard of a duty due to carelessness or indifference; penalized for six (6) months suspension, considering that this is their first offense after several years in public service. (Jomadiao, et al. vs. Arboleda, G.R. 230322, Feb. 19, 2020)

Violation of two (2) or more different offenses 
- Under Section 55 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, if the respondent is found guilty of two (2) or more different offenses, the imposable penalty should be for the most serious offense, while the rest shall be considered aggravating; since the penalty for Immorality (Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct) is suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day for the first offense, in consideration of the two (2) aggravating circumstances in the case at bar, we submit that the respondent be suspended for one (1) year; Garra's deliberate omissions of his marital status in his SALNs were committed not less than three (3) times, particularly, when he intentionally made such omissions in his 2007 to 2011 SALNs, including his SALNs beginning 2013; these omissions, when so treated separately, could have merited the penalty of dismissal under the RRACCS; considering his length of service, and given that his marital status is not a material component of the SALNs, the penalty of suspension for a period of one (1) year is in order. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### QUASI-DELICTS

Institution of civil case with the criminal case 
- Under the Rules, when "a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action"; however, the civil action referred to in Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the New Civil Code shall "proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a preponderance of evidence"; it is explicitly stated in Article 2177 of the Civil Code that responsibility arising from quasi-delict "is entirely separate and distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal Code"; the same rule finds support from Article 31 of the same Code which states that when "the civil action is based on an obligation not arising from the act or omission complained of as a felony, such civil action may proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter"; regardless of the outcome of the criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting to homicide instituted against Timtim, a civil case for quasi-delict may proceed independently against Timtim's employer, ES Trucking, under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

Presumption of negligence 
- The basis for the liability of an employer of an erring driver resulting to injury or damage to a stranger may be found in Articles 2176 and 2180 of the New Civil Code; it has been proven by preponderant evidence that Timtim recklessly drove the prime mover truck which caused the death of Catalina; although the employer is not the actual tortfeasor, the law makes the employer vicariously liable on the basis of the civil law principle of pater familias for failure to exercise due care and vigilance over the acts of one's subordinates to prevent damage to another; when the employee causes damage due to his own negligence while performing his own duties, there arises a presumption that the employer is negligent; this may be rebutted only by proof of observance of the diligence of a good father of a family; the "diligence of a good father" referred to in the last paragraph of Article 2180 means diligence in the selection and supervision of employees; in the selection of its prospective employees, the employer is required to examine them as to their qualifications, experience, and service records; ES Trucking is not only at fault for blatantly disregarding pertinent laws and rules governing trucks for hire but is also guilty of violating its undertaking to preserve the vehicle in its original state while the case is pending; ES Trucking failed to sufficiently exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection and supervision of its employee, Timtim. (Heirs of Catalina P. Mendoza vs. ES Trucking and Forwarders, G.R. 243237, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### RAPE

Impotency as a defense 
- Accused-appellant attempts to cast doubt on his conviction by arguing that his advanced age made erection—and thus, sex—impossible; this argument is unmeritorious; impotence must be proven with certainty in order to overcome the presumption of potency; in rape cases, impotency as a defense must be proven with certainty to overcome the presumption in favor of potency; here, the evidence proffered by the defense failed to discharge such burden. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### RAPE UNDER ARTICLE 266-A IN RELATION TO ARTICLE 266-B OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE (RPC)

Rape via sexual intercourse distinguished from sexual assault 
- Rape via sexual intercourse is committed only by a man through the penile penetration of the woman victim's vagina; on the other hand, sexual assault may be committed by either a man or a woman against a man or a woman through the insertion of the penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or the insertion of any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; the Information charged accused-appellant with rape through carnal knowledge; however, the pieces of evidence disclose that accused-appellant inserted his finger, not his penis, into the vagina of AAA, without her consent, by threatening to kill AAA and her family if she did not submit to his bestial desires; however, accused-appellant cannot be convicted of sexual assault considering that the latter crime has been held not to be included in rape via sexual intercourse given the essential difference in the means of commission (penile penetration v. object penetration). (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### RAPE UNDER ARTICLE 266-A IN RELATION TO ARTICLE 266-B OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AS AMENDED BY R.A. 8353 (THE ANTI-RAPE LAW OF 1997)

Penalty and civil liability 
- This Court affirms accused-appellant's conviction for rape through sexual intercourse under Art. 266-A in relation to Art. 266-B of the RPC, amended by R.A. 8353; in Criminal Case No. P-4357, the Court finds the penalty of reclusion perpetua in order; the award of Php75,000.00 each in civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages is likewise sustained being in accordance with current jurisprudence. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### RAPE UNDER ARTICLE 266-A(1) OF THE RPC, AS AMENDED BY R.A. 8353 (THE ANTI-RAPE LAW OF 1997)

Elements 
- To obtain a conviction for a charge of rape under Article 266-A(1) of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, the prosecution must establish that: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) he accomplished this act under the circumstances mentioned in the provision, e.g., through force, threat or intimidation; the gravamen of rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will; the Court agrees that the prosecution had adequately proven accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt for rape committed on 02 January 2010; AAA's testimony, corroborated by Dr. Celzo's medical findings, clearly established that accused-appellant had sexual intercourse with AAA, without the latter's consent; having instilled fear of physical harm against AAA's person and her family, accused-appellant successfully cowed AAA and led her to believe that she had no choice but to do accused-appellant's bidding. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LAW (ACT NO. 3135)

Extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage 
- It is already a settled rule that a buyer in a foreclosure sale becomes the absolute owner of the property purchased if no redemption is made within one year from the registration of the sale; being the absolute owner, he is entitled to all the rights of ownership over the property including the right of possession; the buyer can demand possession of the land even during the redemption period except that he has to post a bond pursuant to Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended; the bond is no longer required after the redemption period if the property is not redeemed; a writ of possession is a writ of execution used to enforce a judgment for the recovery of possession of a land; it instructs the sheriff to enter the subject land and gives its possession to the one entitled to under the judgment; further, a writ of possession may be issued in favor of the successful buyer in a foreclosure sale of REM either (1) within the one-year redemption period, upon the filing of a bond by the buyer; or (2) after the redemption period, with no bond required; the duty of the court to issue a writ of possession is ministerial and may not be stayed by a pending action for annulment of the mortgage or the foreclosure itself; the only exception is when a third party is actually holding the property by adverse title or right. (HH & Co. Agricultural Corporation vs. Perlas, G.R. 217095, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### REGIONAL TRIAL COURT (RTC)

Jurisdiction 
- As conferred by Section 19 of B.P. Blg. 129, the RTC has jurisdiction over all civil cases in which the subject matter under litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation; one of which, as established by jurisprudence, is a complaint for injunction; it is a well-settled rule that jurisdiction of the court is determined by the allegations in the complaint and the character of the relief sought; here, the principal action is one for injunction, which is within the jurisdiction of the RTC; in determining the jurisdiction of the RTC, what is controlling is the principal action, and not the ancilliary remedy which is merely an incident thereto. (Spouses Soller, et al. vs. Hon. Singson, in his capacity as Secretary of Department of Public Works and Highways, et al., G.R. 215547, Feb. 3, 2020)


- Both the trial court and the respondents justify CIAC jurisdiction over the case at bar by citing the construction tribunal's expertise in handling factual circumstances involving construction matters; such justification loses sight of the fact that a trial court's main function is passing upon questions of fact; time and again, this Court has held that factual matters are best ventilated before the trial court, as it has the power to receive and evaluate evidence first-hand; that the dispute at bar involves technical matters does not automatically divest the trial court of its jurisdiction; the court a quo has ample means of handling such technical matters, as it may utilize expert testimony or appoint commissioners to handle the technical matters involved in the suit; the core issue of this suit is whether or not the construction activities of respondents caused the damage to the spouses Ang's house; and the resolution of this mixed question of fact and law is well within the jurisdiction of the court a quo to decide. (Ang vs. De Venecia, et al., G.R. 217151, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### RES JUDICATA

Bar by prior judgment 
- Even assuming that the Court of Appeals correctly categorized respondents defense as res judicata through bar by prior judgment, it would still not lie; this principle requires a prior valid judgment issued by a tribunal having jurisdiction over the subject matter; under the 2003 Rules of Procedure, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) has jurisdiction over cases "involving the ejectment and dispossession of tenants and/or leaseholders" or "the review of leasehold rentals"; this controversy arose precisely because respondents never submitted the property to the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), as required by the Compromise Agreement; the DARAB assumed jurisdiction over respondents' action based on a condition in the Compromise Agreement that respondents never actually fulfilled; Department of Agrarian Reform v. Paramount Holdings Equities, cited. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- Here, the Court of Appeals seems to have confused the two concepts; "the resolution on the second case . . . as to whether respondents may be obliged to comply with the assailed provision in the Compromise Agreement, i.e., to offer the land to the government under the Voluntary Offer to Sell scheme, essentially hinges on the rights that have been previously determined with finality in the first case; while the identity of the parties is the same, the rights asserted and the reliefs prayed for are different in the two cases; the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board has no jurisdiction over an action for specific performance; the finality of the first case would not bar the adjudication of the present case. (Id.)


- Res judicata applies in the concept of "bar by prior judgment" if the following requisites concur: (1) the former judgment or order must be final; (2) the judgment or order must be on the merits; (3) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and (4) there must be, between the first and the second action, identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action; all of the elements of the doctrine of res judicata are present in this case; considering that the only issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 126282, and consequently, the present petition, is the propriety of the issuance of the writ of attachment, a subsequent resolution of that issue already resolved by the Court in G.R. 243036 is conclusive on and bars the resolution of the present petition. (Burgundy Realty Corporation, et al. vs. MAA General Assurance Phils., Inc., G.R. 225610, Feb. 19, 2020)

Concept 
- "Res judicata (meaning, a "matter adjudged") is a fundamental principle of law that precludes parties from re-litigating issues actually litigated and determined by a prior and final judgment"; in Degayo v. Magbanua-Dinglasan, the Court explained the effect of res judicata: It rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate; the doctrine of res judicata is set forth in Section 47 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)


- Res judicata is a legal principle where a party is barred from raising an issue or presenting evidence on a fact that has already been judicially tried and decided; "a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment"; application of the principle, provided under Rule 39, Section 47 of the Rules of Court; as explained in P.D. No. 1271 Committee v. De Guzman, res judicata is premised on the idea that judgments must be final and conclusive; otherwise, there would be no end to litigation; in applying res judicata, courts must first distinguish between two (2) concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment; and (2) conclusiveness of judgment; in Spouses Aboitiz v. Spouses Po, this Court explained the difference between the two: Res judicata in the concept of bar by prior judgment proscribes the filing of another action based on "the same claim, demand, or cause of action"; it applies when the following are present: (a) there is a final judgment or order; (b) it is a judgment or order on the merits; (c) it was "rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties"; and (d) there is "identity of parties, of subject matter, and of causes of action" between the first and second actions; res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment applies when there is an identity of issues in two (2) cases between the same parties involving different causes of action. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- Since the Court of Appeals reasoned that the specific performance case would involve a re-litigation of the same facts or issues as the recovery of possession case, the more accurate concept would have been conclusiveness of judgment; in Spouses Antonio v. de Monje: Where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein; concept of res judicata known as "conclusiveness of judgment"; any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same; conclusiveness of judgment finds application when a fact or question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and adjudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction; the fact or question settled by final judgment or order binds the parties to that action (and persons in privity with them or their successors-in-interest), and continues to bind them while the judgment or order remains standing and unreversed by proper authority on a timely motion or petition; only the identities of parties and issues are required for the operation of the principle of conclusiveness of judgment. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- The doctrine of res judicata refers to the rule that a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on points and matters determined in the former suit; it rests on the principle that parties should not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate. (Burgundy Realty Corporation, et al. vs. MAA General Assurance Phils., Inc., G.R. 225610, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The issue raised in petitioner's action for specific performance is whether respondents can be compelled to comply with the stipulations in the Compromise Agreement; the trial court must address the preliminary issue of whether respondents actually complied with the stipulations in the Compromise Agreement; this must be conclusively resolved first before the Decision in the recovery of possession case can operate as res judicata through conclusiveness of judgment; a review of its Decision, however, shows that the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) never actually passed upon the issue of compliance; the Compromise Agreement shows that its main intent was to prevent petitioners' predecessors-in-interest, the disputed lot's actual occupants and cultivators, from being displaced; it expressly mandated that they "shall not be displaced and transferred to any area without their respective consent"; by instituting the case for recovery of possession, respondents would have violated the stipulations of the Compromise Agreement, since a favorable decision has the effect of displacing petitioners' predecessors-in-interest without their consent; the DARAB's Decision had no effect on the validity of the Compromise Agreement, because the ruling did not pass upon any of its stipulations; petitioners, as the successors-in-interest, could institute an action for the enforcement of the Compromise Agreement. (Heirs of Salvador and Salvacion Lamirez, namely Martha, et al. vs. Spouses Ampatuan, et al., G.R. 226043, Feb. 3, 2020)


- There are two (2) concepts of res judicata: 1) bar by prior judgment, which is found in Section 47(b) of Rule 39; and 2) conclusiveness of judgment, which is referred to in paragraph c of the same rule and section; distinction discussed in Puerto Azul Land, Inc. v. Pacific Wide Realty Dev't. Corp.: There is a bar by prior judgment where there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred; there is conclusiveness of judgment, on the other hand, where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action; res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment applies in this case; both the present case and Civil Case No. 12-128721 involve the same parties and subject matter; only the cause of action is different; res judicata in the concept of conclusiveness of judgment "precludes the relitigation only of a particular fact or issue necessary to the outcome of a prior action between the same parties on a different claim or cause of action." (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### RESISTANCE OR DISOBEDIENCE TO A PERSON IN AUTHORITY OR HIS AGENT

Elements 
- Resistance or disobedience is punished under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code; two (2) key elements must be shown: "(1) That a person in authority or his agent is engaged in the performance of official duty or gives a lawful order to the offender; and (2) That the offender resists or seriously disobeys such person or his agent"; based on the circumstances, petitioner's resistance and use of force are not so serious to be deemed as direct assault; while she exerted force, it is not dangerous, grave, or severe enough to warrant the penalties attached to the crime; thus, instead of direct assault, this Court convicts petitioner of resistance or disobedience; here, although the charge is direct assault, the prosecution was able to prove resistance or disobedience; these offenses have similar elements, varying only as to the degree of seriousness of the offender's resistance; direct assault necessarily includes resistance or disobedience; petitioner is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of resistance or disobedience under Article 151 of the Revised Penal Code; penalty. (Mallari vs. People, G.R. 224679, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### REVISED RULES ON ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE (RRACCS)

Gross Neglect of Duty, Grave Misconduct, and Serious Dishonesty 
- Under the Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (RRACCS), Gross Neglect of Duty, Grave Misconduct, and Serious Dishonesty are grave offenses which are punishable by dismissal from the service; also, the following administrative disabilities shall be imposed: (1) cancellation of eligibility; (2) forfeiture of retirement and other benefits, except accrued leave credits, if any; (3) perpetual disqualification from holding public office; and (4) bar from taking civil service examinations; the penalty of fine should be imposed; and the amount of which lies within the Sound discretion of the Court; Section 51(d) of the RRACCS provides that the penalty of fine shall be in an amount not exceeding six months' salary of respondent; penalty of fine equivalent to Uyan's salary for one month which shall be deducted from his accrued leave benefits in view of the mitigating circumstances of advanced age and his length of service. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Salunoy, Court Stenographer, A.M. No. P-07-2354, Feb. 4, 2020)

Violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations 
- By his own admission that he entered the premises of Sampaga's quarters in Room 110 instead of meeting her in the lounge as required by the House Rules, Garra is deemed liable for Violation of Reasonable Office Rules and Regulations under Section 46(F)(3), Rule 10 of the RRACCS; whether Sampaga is Garra's legal or common-law spouse is of no moment; the rules are clear that all guests, regardless of their relation to the occupants of the PHILJA Training Center, are only allowed to conduct visits in the lounge. (Re: Incident Report of the Security Division and Alleged Various Infractions committed by Mr. Cloyd D. Garra, Judicial Staff Employee II, Mediation, Planning and Research Division, Philippine Mediation Center Office, Philippine Judicial Academy, A.M. No. 2019-14-SC, Feb. 10, 2020)

#### ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE

Commission of 
- The Information charged appellants with Robbery with Homicide and Frustrated Homicide; however, the Court ruled in People v. Tidong, viz.: There is no special complex crime of robbery with homicide and double frustrated homicide; the offense should have been designated as robbery with homicide alone, regardless of the number of homicides or injuries committed; these other felonies have, at the most and under appropriate circumstances, been considered merely as generic aggravating circumstances which can be offset by mitigating circumstances; the term "homicide" in paragraph 1 of Article 294 is used in its generic sense, that is, any act that results in death; any other act producing injuries short of death is integrated in the "homicide" committed by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, assuming, of course, that the homicide is consummated; if no death supervenes, the accused should be held liable for separate crimes of robbery and frustrated or attempted homicide or murder (provided that there was intent to kill) if the latter offenses were not necessary for the commission of the robbery, or for a complex crime of robbery and frustrated or attempted homicide or murder under Article 48 of the Code if the latter offenses were the necessary means for the commission of robbery. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

Elements 
- Robbery with homicide exists when a homicide is committed either by reason, or on occasion, of the robbery; to sustain a conviction for robbery with homicide, the prosecution must prove the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property belonging to another; (2) with intent to gain; (3) with the use of violence or intimidation against a person; and (4) on the occasion or by reason of the robbery, the crime of homicide, as used in the generic sense, was committed; a conviction needs certainty that the robbery is the central purpose and objective of the malefactor and the killing is merely incidental to the robbery; the intent to rob must precede the taking of human life but the killing may occur before, during or after the robbery. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

Penalty 
- As regards the penalty imposed, we agree with the CA that the death penalty should have been imposed, if not for the proscription in R.A. 9346, since the crime was committed by a band and with the use of an unlicensed firearm; accordingly, appellants were correctly meted the penalty of reclusion perpetua but they are not eligible for parole; moreover, pursuant to prevailing jurisprudence, the damages awarded must be further modified as follows: The award of civil indemnity is increased to P100,000.00 for each victim; moral damages and exemplary damages of P100,000.00 each for each victim are awarded; finally, all these damages shall earn interest at the rate of six percent (6 percent ) per annum from date of finality of this judgment until full payment. (People vs. Labuguen alias "Tinong," et al., G.R. 223103, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### RULES OF PROCEDURE

Death of a party 
- Section 16, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court lays down the procedure for the substitution of a party-litigant who dies during the pendency of a case; thus, when a party to a case dies, his or her counsel is charged with the duty of informing the trial court of, first, the fact of the litigant's death and, second, the name and address of the litigant's representative; the court must then issue an order requiring the said representative to appear and formally be substituted; however, if no representative is so named or if he or she does not appear, the court may direct the adverse party to procure an executor or administrator, who will be tasked to represent the deceased party until the case is terminated. (Republic, represented by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) vs. Estate of Juan Maria Posadas III, et al., G.R. 214310, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### SAFE SPACES ACT (R.A. 11313)

Duties of an employer 
- In recognizing the need to address these concerns, the State's policy against sexual harassment has been strengthened through R.A. 11313, otherwise known as the Safe Spaces Act; this law has expanded the definition of gender-based sexual harassment in the workplace and has added to the duties of an employer as to its prevention, deterrence, and punishment; it explicitly requires that complaints be investigated and resolved within 10 days or less upon its reporting; it likewise expressly provides for the liability of employers and duties of co-workers as to sexual harassment; the law likewise specifies the confidentiality of proceedings, and the issuance of a restraining order for the offended person; moreover, it allows local government units to impose heavier penalties on perpetrators; while this law does not apply to this case as it was enacted after the commission of Batucan's acts, its principles emphasize the need to accord more importance to complaints of sexual harassment and recognize the severity of the offense. (LBC Express-Vis, Inc. vs. Palco, G.R. 217101, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### SALES

Contract to sell 
- Based on the parties' allegations, the key issue pertains to the applicability of Olivarez Realty Corporation v. Castillo, which similarly involves the retention of partial payments made on a failed contract to sell; Olivarez involved the sale of a parcel of land, which the buyer undertook to pay in several installments; the parties executed a deed of conditional sale, stipulating that in addition to the installment payments, the buyer would also institute the necessary legal actions to clear the property of tenants, and of an adverse claim by the Philippine Tourism Authority; it was also stipulated that the buyer could immediately take possession of the property after signing the deed of conditional sale, which it did; however, the deed of absolute sale would be executed by the seller only after the full payment of the purchase price; while the buyer was able to pay a portion of the agreed purchase price, it failed to pay the succeeding installments and to institute the legal action required under the contract; this led the seller to rescind the contract; however, in view of the buyer's 14-year occupancy of the premises without full payment of the purchase price, the sellers also sought to have the partial payments forfeited in their favor; the foregoing circumstances allowed this Court to rule that the contract between the parties in Olivarez was a contract to sell; Olivarez also cited the case of Gomez v. Court of Appeals, where this Court clarified that partial payments on a failed contract to sell may be retained by the seller as "reasonable compensation for use of the property." (Spouses Godinez vs. Spouses Norman, G.R. 225449, Feb. 26, 2020)


- This Court finds the application of Olivarez in order; here, petitioners turned over possession of the premises to respondents after the latter made partial payments amounting to USD10,000.00; respondents then moved their furniture and groceries into one of the housing unit's rooms and also hired a house helper to watch over the premises in the interim; respondents made subsequent payments, bringing its total to USD40,000.00, but the contract to sell still failed to take effect because of respondents' subsequent default in paying the balance; during this five (5) month period, petitioners were unable to enjoy their property despite retaining a key to the premises; thus, petitioners should have been compensated for respondents' use of the property, consistent with Olivarez; the conversion of partial payments into rentals is also consistent with Article 1378 of the Civil Code, which teaches that doubts in the interpretation of onerous contracts "should be settled in favor of the greatest reciprocity of interests"; We find it only proper that respondents reciprocate their use of the premises with the payment of rentals while full payment on their contract to sell was still pending; Olivarez also recognized that compensation for use of the property must be reasonable; in Olivarez, this Court allowed the seller to retain the partial payments because the buyers possessed and used the property without paying rentals; likewise, Gomez considered the "benefits, financial or otherwise" enjoyed by the buyer in determining whether or not to retain partial payments as reasonable compensation; in both cases, the sellers were unable to use their respective properties because the buyers were in possession thereof. (Id.)


- While there is no definitive legal standard for computing reasonable rentals on residential properties, this Court notes that USD40,000.00 amounts to 22.9 percent , or over a fifth, of the total purchase price of petitioner's housing unit, which is not commensurate to the value respondents may have derived from their four (4) month possession of the property; while respondents' possession prevented petitioners from using the premises, even petitioners recognized that respondents did not actually occupy the housing unit; there is also no evidence before this Court indicating the "benefits, financial or otherwise," that respondents may have derived from their possession; thus, respondents' limited use of the premises requires us to temper the amount of partial payments that petitioners may reasonably retain; determining reasonable rentals would depend on the circumstances of the parties, the nature of the property being rented, and the prevailing situation in the relevant market at the time of the transaction, among others; ordinarily, this would require reception of evidence, and thus, a remand of the case to the lower courts; however, in order to speedily dispose of this case, and in view of the time already spent litigating this issue, a recourse to the analogous case of Olivarez is proper; in Olivarez, this Court effectively allowed the prospective seller to convert partial payments to rentals, with such rentals amounting to 13.1 percent  of the property's total purchase price; having already determined the applicability of the Olivarez ruling on the retention of partial payments, the circumstances of this case would warrant the retention of a similar amount; thus, rentals for the housing unit may be set at 13.1 percent  of the USD175,000.00 total purchase price, or USD22,925.00; petitioners may, therefore, retain USD22,925.00 of the USD40,000.00 partially paid by respondents, but must return the remaining USD17,075.00 to respondents. (Id.)

Sale of a piece of land or interest thereon through an agent 
- When the sale of a piece of land or any interest thereon is through an agent, the authority of the latter shall be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void; this authority must be contained in a special power of attorney, that is, a specific written grant of authority in favor of an agent to sell a piece of land belonging to the principal; for the principal to confer the right upon an agent to sell real estate, a power of attorney must so express the powers of the agent in clear and unmistakable language; when there is any reasonable doubt that the language so used conveys such power, no such construction shall be given the document. (Arriola vs. People, G.R. 199975, Feb. 24, 2020)

#### SEAFARERS

Death benefits 
- Crucial to the determination of petitioner's entitlement to death benefits as well as her right to get reimbursement for transportation and burial expenses she incurred are Sections 18.1b, 21, 22, and 25 of the CBA; the cause of death of the seafarer is immaterial to the determination of petitioner's entitlement to the said benefits; it is clear from the express provision of Section 25.1 of the CBA that respondents hold themselves liable for death benefits for the death of the seafarer under their employ for any cause; under Annex 4 of the CBA, the same shall be in the amount of USD89,100.00; respondents also obligated themselves to pay the transportation expenses for the repatriation of the body of the deceased, as well as the burial expenses; Sections 21 and 22 of the CBA did not limit the liability of the respondents to deaths that are directly attributable to sickness or injury, but rather widens its coverage to also include seafarers who died or signed off due to sickness or injury; it is settled that in the event that the clauses in the CBA provide for greater benefits to the seafarer, the same must prevail over the standard terms and benefits formulated by the POEA in its Standard Employment Contract inasmuch as a contract of labor is so impressed with public interest that the more beneficial conditions must be endeavored in favor of the laborer; maximum aid and full protection to labor enshrined in Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### SEARCH WARRANT

Service of 
- Section 9, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court states: Section 9. Time of making search. – The warrant must direct that it be served in the day time, unless the affidavit asserts that the property is on the person or in the place ordered to be searched, in which case a direction may be inserted that it be served at any time of the day or night; in People v. Court of Appeals, the Court explained that a search warrant, as an exception, may be enforced at any reasonable hour of the day or night, to wit: The general rule is that search warrants must be served during the daytime; however, the rule allows an exception, namely, a search at any reasonable hour of the day or night, when the application asserts that the property is on the person or place ordered to be searched; in this case, the search warrant stated that the search shall be made at "ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT"; the RTC Cebu City issued the search warrant based on the deposition of PO3 Arturo Enriquez and PO3 Jesus Manulat, which stated that they allegedly bought shabu from petitioner at about 9:00 in the evening; thus, the RTC Cebu City had basis to state that the search warrant may also be implemented at dawn or early morning. (Tumabini vs. People, G.R. 224495, Feb. 19, 2020)

#### SELF-DEFENSE

As a justifying circumstance 
- Considering that self-defense is an affirmative allegation, and totally exonerates the accused from any criminal liability, it is well settled that when it is invoked, the burden of evidence shifts to the accused to prove it by credible, clear and convincing evidence; the accused claiming self-defense must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution; self-defense cannot be justifiably appreciated when uncorroborated by independent and competent evidence, or when it is extremely doubtful by itself. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The nature, character, location and extent of these wounds belie accused-appellant's claim that Olipio attacked him with a bolo; and it was in self-defense that after wrestling the bolo from the victim, accused-appellant used it against the latter; the appearances of the wounds on the victim's heart, his internal organs and large intestine contradict accused-appellant's defense that he had only hit Olipio twice in the stomach and that after the second blow, both of them fell and rolled on the ground which caused the wounds at the back; assuming that Olipio was the aggressor, it is nevertheless apparent that at the time he was killed, the danger to accused-appellant had already ceased; even after taking full control of the bolo, he attacked the victim several times and stabbed him to death; settled is the rule that when the unlawful aggression ceases, the defender no longer has any right to kill or wound the former aggressor; otherwise, retaliation and not self-defense is committed. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

Elements 
- By invoking the justifying circumstance of self-defense, accused-appellant thus admits committing the acts constituting the crime for which he was charged and the burden of proof is on him to establish, by clear and convincing proof, that (1) there was unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; (2) the reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) the lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)


- The essential elements of self-defense are the following: (1) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel such aggression, and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself; to successfully invoke self-defense, there must have been an unlawful and unprovoked attack that endangered the life of the accused, who was then forced to inflict severe wounds upon the assailant by employing reasonable means to resist the attack; while all three elements must concur, first and foremost self-defense relies on proof of unlawful aggression on the part of the victim; unlawful aggression is a condition sine qua non for upholding the justifying circumstance of self-defense; if there is nothing to prevent or repel, the other two requisites of self-defense will have no basis. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSONS

Jurisdiction of probate courts 
- In Bernardo v. Court of Appeals, this Court held that the question of ownership of certain properties, whether they belong to the conjugal partnership or to the husband exclusively, is within the jurisdiction of the probate court, which necessarily has to liquidate the conjugal partnership in order to determine the estate of the decedent: The jurisdiction to try controversies between heirs of a deceased person regarding the ownership of properties alleged to belong to his estate has been recognized to be vested in probate courts; this is so because the purpose of an administration proceeding is the liquidation of the estate and distribution of the residue among the heirs and legatees; liquidation means determination of all the assets of the estate and payment of all the debts and expenses; thereafter, distribution is made of the decedent's liquidated estate among the persons entitled to succeed him; the proceeding is in the nature of an action of partition in which each party is required to bring into the mass whatever community property he has in his possession; to this end and as a necessary corollary, the interested parties may introduce proofs relative to the ownership of the properties in dispute; all the heirs who take part in the distribution of the decedent's estate are before the court, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, in all matters and incidents necessary to the complete settlement of such estate, so long as no interests of third parties are affected. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)


- In Heirs of Reyes v. Reyes, this Court affirmed the probate court's provisional inclusion of properties to the deceased's estate, without prejudice to the outcome of a separate action to determine ownership, because the properties were still titled under the Torrens system in the names of the deceased and his spouse; unlike in Heirs of Reyes, the parcels of land in this case were already titled in respondent's name alone; thus, to determine the issue of ownership in a separate proceeding would be unnecessary; it is settled that the "certificate of title is the best evidence of ownership of a property"; thus, the titles issued to respondent, being Torrens titles, are conclusive upon the parties: In regard to such incident of inclusion or exclusion, We hold that if a property covered by Torrens Title is involved, the presumptive conclusiveness of such title should be given due weight, and in the absence of strong compelling evidence to the contrary, the holder thereof should be considered as the owner of the property in controversy until his or her title is nullified or modified in an appropriate ordinary action, particularly, when as in the case at bar, possession of the property itself is in the persons named in the title. (Id.)

Titles of properties 
- As a general rule, the question as to titles of properties should not be passed upon in testate or intestate proceedings, but should be ventilated in a separate action; however, for purposes of expediency and convenience, this general rule is subject to exceptions, such that: (1) "the probate court may provisionally pass upon in an intestate or testate proceeding the question of inclusion in, or exclusion from, the inventory of a piece of property without prejudice to its final determination in a separate action"; and (2) the probate court is competent to decide the question of ownership "if the interested parties are all heirs, or the question is one of collation or advancement, or the parties consent" to the probate court's assumption of jurisdiction and "the rights of third parties are not impaired." (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### SHARI'A DISTRICT COURT

Jurisdiction 
- A probate court's determination of ownership over properties forming part of the estate is only provisional; as explained in Romero v. Court of Appeals, "this rule is applicable only as between the representatives of the estate and strangers thereto"; since petitioners and respondent are all heirs and parties in the settlement proceeding of Mahid's estate, petitioners should have contested the exclusion of the properties before the Shari'a District Court, then acting as a probate court; however, they did not lift a finger to ask the probate court to include the properties in the inventory; by failing to do so, petitioners are deemed to have acquiesced to the exclusion of the properties from the inventory, along with respondent's ownership over them; in Pacioles, Jr. v. Chuatoco-Ching, where the respondent and her representative could have opposed the petitioner's inventory and sought the exclusion of the properties she considered hers, but instead adopted the inventory, this Court held that she and her representative acquiesced with petitioner's inventory. (Mutilan, et al. vs. Mutilan, known recently as Cadidia Imam Samporna, et al., G.R. 216109, Feb. 5, 2020)


- The Code of Muslim Personal Laws provides that "the Shari'a District Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all cases involving disposition, distribution and settlement of the estate of deceased Muslims, probate of wills, issuance of letters of administration or appointment of administrators or executors regardless of the nature or the aggregate value of the property"; its decisions shall be final, except when it shall affect the original and appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as provided in the Constitution; the Shari'a District Court, acting as a probate court, issued an Omnibus Order on October 15, 2008 approving the inventory of Mahid's estate, which excluded the two (2) parcels of land in respondent's name; in another Order, it ruled upon the Writ of Possession on the same parcels of land; thus, the Shari'a District Court acted pursuant to the Code of Muslim Personal Laws, which provides: ARTICLE 38. Regime of property relations. 
- The property relations between the spouses, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary in the marriage settlements or any other contract, shall be governed by the regime of complete separation of property in accordance with this Code and, in a suppletory manner, by the general principles of Islamic law and the Civil Code of the Philippines; considering that the interested parties here are all heirs of the decedent and there are no third parties whose rights will be impaired, this case falls under the exception to the general rule; the Shari'a District Court properly exercised its jurisdiction when it passed upon the question of title and excluded the parcels of land in respondent's name from the inventory of Mahid's estate; per the Code of Muslim Personal Laws, its decision shall be final. (Id.)

#### SPECIAL PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AGAINST CHILD ABUSE, EXPLOITATION AND DISCRIMINATION ACT (R.A. 7610)

Lascivious conduct under Section 5 (b) 
- Pueyo's liability for fines in view of People v. Cadiente, Olivares v. Court of Appeals, and Amployo v. People is further increased; In the said cases, this Court affirmed the trial court's imposition of the discretionary fine provided under Section 31(f), Article XII of R.A. 7610 against offenders under Section 5(b) of the same law for the rehabilitation of the child victims; the gravity of the case at hand cannot be discounted; AAA's potential trauma from her genital damage, as indiscriminately inflicted upon her by Pueyo when she was only six years old, is a burden that AAA may likely suffer throughout her formative years or even for the rest of her life; We hold that Pueyo be made liable for the additional fine of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) pursuant to Section 31 (f), Article XII of R.A. 7610. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)


- The case of People v. Tulagan reconciled the provisions of acts of lasciviousness, rape via carnal knowledge and sexual assault in the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353, vis-à-vis R.A. 7610; this Court reiterated the guidelines in People v. Caoili in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, and in determining the proper penalty, viz: 1. The age of the victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty. 2. If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610"; pursuant to the second proviso in said Section 5(b), the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period. 3. If the victim is exactly twelve (12) years of age, or more than twelve (12) but below eighteen (18) years of age, or is eighteen (18) years old or older but is unable to fully take care of herself/himself or protect herself/himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition, the crime should be designated as "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610," and the imposable penalty is reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua; since AAA was 13 years old at the time of the commission of the crime, as shown by her birth certificate, the proper designation of the crime committed is lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610; thus, in Criminal Case No. P-4356, this Court finds accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the said offense. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The Court finds that based on the facts established, accused-appellant may still be convicted of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610; while the Information in Criminal Case No. P-4356 alleges the elements of rape through sexual intercourse, the prosecution was able to prove during trial that accused-appellant committed lascivious acts against AAA; the kissing of a minor victim's lips, mashing of her breast and insertion of the offender's finger into the victim's vagina, have been held to constitute lascivious conduct within the purview of Section 2(h) of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of Child Abuse Cases, in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, which defines lascivious conduct as: The intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks, or the introduction of any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth, of any person, whether of the same or opposite sex, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of an person, bestiality, masturbation, lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a person; in People v. Caoili, the Court held that an accused may be held guilty of acts of lasciviousness performed on a child, i.e., lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, which was the offense proved, because it is included in rape, the offense charged. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

Violation of Section 5 (B) 
- People v. Dagsa sets the parameters in determining whether there is a violation of Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, viz.: The essential elements of this provision are: 1. The accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct. 2. The said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse. 3. The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age; as to the first element, paragraph (h), Section 2 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 7610 defines lascivious conduct as a crime committed through the intentional touching, either directly or through the clothing of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks with the intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, among others; the second element requires that the lascivious conduct be committed on a child who is either exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; this second element requires evidence proving that: (a) [the victim] was either exploited in prostitution or subjected to sexual abuse; and (b) [the victim] is a child as defined under R.A. 7610. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

Violation of Section 10 (a) 
- The courts below found Pueyo criminally liable under Section 10 (a), R.A. 7610, which require the following elements: (1) AAA's minority; (2) the acts constituting physical abuse committed by Pueyo against AAA; and (3) the fact that the said acts are clearly punishable under R.A. 7610; the fact of minority of AAA is long settled, her being six years old at the time of the incident and eight years old when she took the witness stand; it was likewise established that Pueyo physically abused AAA when he poked her genitals with a welding rod, an act that is plainly child abuse as contemplated under Section 3(b) of R.A. 7610. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### STATUTORY RAPE

Commission of 
- In the 2017 cases of People v. Deniega and People v. Niebres, the Court held that sexual intercourse with a mental retardate whose mental age is below 12 years old constitutes statutory rape; these cases cite People v. Quintos, which provided for the distinctions between "deprived of reason," "demented" and "mental retardation"; to quote: The term, "deprived of reason," is associated with insanity or madness; a person deprived of reason has mental abnormalities that affect his or her reasoning and perception of reality and, therefore, his or her capacity to resist, make decisions, and give consent; the term "demented," refers to a person who suffers from a mental condition called dementia; dementia refers to the deterioration or loss of mental functions such as memory, learning, speaking, and social condition, which impairs one's independence in everyday activities; the terms, "mental retardation" or "intellectual disability," had been classified under "deprived of reason"; the terms, "deprived of reason" and "demented," however, should be differentiated from the term, "mentally retarded" or "intellectually disabled"; an intellectually disabled person is not necessarily deprived of reason or demented; a person's capacity to decide whether to give consent or to express resistance to an adult activity is determined not by his or her chronological age but by his or her mental age; in determining whether a person is "twelve (12) years of age" under Article 266-A(1)(d), the interpretation should be in accordance with either the chronological age of the child if he or she is not suffering from intellectual disability, or the mental age if intellectual disability is established. (People vs. Castillo, G.R. 242276, Feb. 18, 2020)

Elements 
- As regards rape of a mental retardate, the Court now holds that, following People v. Quintos, when the victim is a mental retardate whose mental age is that of a person below 12 years old, the rape should be classified as statutory rape under Article 266-A, paragraph 1(d) of the RPC, as amended; statutory rape is committed when (1) the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age, and (2) the accused had carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation, whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness, or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority; what the law punishes in statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below twelve (12) years old; force, intimidation and physical evidence of injury are not relevant considerations; the only pertinent concern is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge indeed took place. (People vs. Castillo, G.R. 242276, Feb. 18, 2020)


- The prosecution satisfactorily established the mental age of the victim; Dr. Manalo conducted a battery of tests to determine the mental age, social maturity and emotional condition of AAA; Dr. Manalo testified that based on her examination, AAA has a mental age of a 5-year-old; the prosecution also established the elements of statutory rape; first, AAA positively identified accused-appellant as the person who molested her; AAA became pregnant and gave birth to a boy later on; AAA's testimony is sufficient to convict accused-appellant of rape; the nature of the crime of rape often entails reliance on the lone, uncorroborated testimony of the victim, which is sufficient for a conviction, provided that such testimony is clear, convincing, and otherwise consistent with human nature; questions on the credibility of witnesses should best be addressed to the trial court because of its unique position to observe that elusive and incommunicable evidence of the witnesses' deportment on the stand while testifying which is denied to the appellate courts; the rule is even more stringently applied if the appellate court has concurred with the trial court. (Id.)

#### STATUTORY RAPE BY SEXUAL ASSAULT IN RELATION TO R.A. 7610

Elements 
- The following are the elements of statutory rape by sexual assault as defined under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC and established by jurisprudence: (1) That the offender commits an act of sexual assault; (2) That the act of sexual assault is committed by any of the following means: (a) By inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice; or (b) By inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; (3) That the act of sexual assault is accomplished under any of the following circumstances: (a) By using force and intimidation; (b) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; or (d) When the woman is under 12 years of age or demented; the acts of Pueyo have been shown to fall within the punitive purview of rape by sexual assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610; the similar case of People v. Tulagan dictates the indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years, ten (10) months, and twenty-one (21) days of reclusion temporal, as minimum, to fifteen (15) years, six (6) months, and twenty (20) days of reclusion temporal, as maximum, as the correct penalty therefor. (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### SUPREME COURT

Handling and management of court funds 
- Various circulars were issued by this Court as guidance as regards the handling and management of court funds: (1) OCA Circular No. 50-95 which provides for guidelines and procedures in the manner of collecting and depositing court funds; (2) OCA Circular No. 113-2004 which orders the submission of Monthly Reports of Collections and Deposits; (3) Administrative Circular No. 35-2004 which states the duty of the Clerk of Court as regards the keeping of a cash book and cash collection to be deposited with the Land Bank of the Philippines; (4) Administrative Circular No. 3-2000 which among others requires the upkeep of a book embodying all the fees received and collected by the court and demands that all fiduciary collection shall be immediately deposited by the clerk of court, upon receipt thereof, with an authorized government depository bank; (5) Supreme Court Circular No. 13-92 which provides for the duty of the clerk of court to make the necessary deposits of the court's collection from bail bonds, rental deposits and other fiduciary collection; (6) Supreme Court Circular No. 5-93 which requires the clerk of court to deposit court collections with Land Bank of the Philippines or with the Municipal, City or Provincial Treasurer as the case may be; and (7) The 2002 Revised Manual for Clerks of Court which states the guidelines for the accounting of court funds; sufficiency in number of these issuances seeks to emphasize not only the administration of court funds, but also the accountability of court employees. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Salunoy, Court Stenographer, A.M. No. P-07-2354, Feb. 4, 2020)

Power of administrative supervision 
- The retirement program budgets of retiring Justices of collegiate courts are not expressly provided under any law; they are not part of the "retirement and other benefits" to which the statutes pertain, viz., pensions, lump sums, and survivorship; such retirement program budgets are more in the nature of administrative expenses which are allotted by the collegiate courts, with the approval of this Court En Banc, to their respective retiring members in order to recognize and celebrate the latter's service and contribution to the Judiciary, in particular, and the public, in general; there being no explicit statutory mandate that the Justices of the collegiate courts are entitled to retirement program budgets, then, there is also no basis for them to legally demand that such budgets be equal across collegiate courts of the same rank or level; the retirement program budgets of Justices of collegiate courts are subject to the discretion and approval of this Court, as part of its constitutional power of administrative supervision over all courts and personnel thereof; in the exercise of such discretion, the Court takes into consideration several factors, such as, but not limited to, the established or actual costs of the items and activities which are part of the retirement program, the number of employees of the collegiate court, the period of time since the last increase in the retirement program budget, and the availability of funds. (Re: Expenses of Retirement of Court of Appeals Justices, A.M. No. 19-02-03-CA, Feb. 11, 2020)

#### TAX EXEMPTION

Requirements for exemption 
- BIR rulings are the official position of the Bureau to queries raised by taxpayers and other stakeholders relative to clarification and interpretation of tax laws; the primary purpose of a BIR Ruling is simply to determine whether a certain transaction, under the law, is taxable or not based on the circumstances provided by the taxpayer; as admitted by the CIR, rulings merely operate to "confirm" the existence of the conditions for exemption provided under the law; if all the requirements for exemption set forth under the law are complied with, the transaction is considered exempt, whether or not a prior BIR ruling was secured by the taxpayer; in practice, a taxpayer often secures a BIR ruling, prior to entering into a transaction, to prepare for any tax liability; however, in case a taxpayer already paid the tax, believing to be liable therefor, and later on files a claim for refund on the basis of an exemption provided under the law, requiring a prior BIR ruling as a condition for the approval of the refund claim is clearly illogical; there is nothing in Section 40(C)(2) of the NIRC of 1997, as amended, which requires the taxpayer to first secure a prior confirmatory ruling before the transaction may be considered as a tax-free exchange; the BIR should not impose additional requirements not provided by law, which would negate the availment of the tax exemption. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### TAX REFUNDS

Construction of 
- Cases filed before the CTA are litigated de novo; as such, party litigants should prove every minute aspect of their cases; the CTA found that respondents were able to establish their entitlement to the claimed refund; no reason to reverse the findings of the CTA; while tax refunds are strictly construed against the taxpayer, the Government should not resort to technicalities and legalisms, much less frivolous appeals, to keep the money it is not entitled to at the expense of the taxpayers. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Co, et al., G.R. 241424, Feb. 26, 2020)

#### TREACHERY

As an aggravating circumstance 
- Paragraph 16, Article 14 of the RPC defines treachery as the direct employment of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make; the essence of treachery is that, the attack is deliberate and without warning, and done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or to escape; for treachery to be properly appreciated, two elements must be present: (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him; the above-mentioned elements are present in this case. (Casilac vs. People, G.R. 238436, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The qualifying aggravating circumstance of treachery was correctly appreciated in the killings of Suganob and Lomoljo because when they were shot while being hogtied and with plastic bags covering their hands, they had no opportunity to defend themselves and such means was deliberately adopted. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

#### UNLAWFUL DETAINER

Physical or material possession of the property 
- "In an unlawful detainer case, the sole issue for resolution is physical or material possession of the property involved, independent of any claim of ownership by any of the parties"; thus, "courts may pass upon the issue of ownership only for purposes of ascertaining who has the better right of possession; any ruling on ownership is merely provisional and does not bar an action between the same parties regarding title to the property." (Samonte vs. Domingo, G.R. 237720, Feb. 5, 2020)

#### VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT)

Administrative and judicial claim for refund 
- Section 112 (A) and (C) of the NIRC, cited; periods relative to the filing of a claim for VAT refunds; preliminarily, the law allows the taxpayer to file an administrative claim for refund with the BIR within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when the purchase was made (for the input tax paid on capital goods) or after the close of the taxable quarter when the zero-rated or effectively zero-rated sale was made (for input tax attributable to zero-rated sale); the CIR must then act on the claim within 120 days from the submission of complete documents in support of the application; in the event of an adverse decision, the taxpayer may elevate the matter to the CTA by way of a petition for review within 30 days from the receipt of the CIR's decision; if, on the other hand, the 120-day period lapses without any action from the CIR, the taxpayer may validly treat the inaction as denial and file a petition for review before the CTA within 30 days from the expiration of the 120-day period; an appeal taken prior to the expiration of the 120-day period without a decision or action of the CIR is premature, without a cause of action, and, therefore, dismissible on the ground of lack of jurisdiction; Chevron filed an administrative claim for refund with the BIR on November 2, 2010, which was well within the two-year prescriptive period provided by law; upon Chevron's submission of its supporting documents, the CIR had 120 days or until March 2, 2011 to decide whether to grant or deny the application; but the 120-day period expired without the CIR having acted on the claim; at this juncture, Chevron had 30 days from the lapse of the 120-day period or until April 1, 2011 to file its judicial claim; thus, when Chevron filed its petition for review with the CTA on March 23, 2011, it was properly made within the period prescribed by law. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Chevron Holdings, Inc., [Formerly Caltex (Asia) Limited], G.R. 233301, Feb. 17, 2020)

Judicial claim for refund or credit of input VAT 
- Settled is the rule that it is only upon the submission of complete documents in support of the application for tax credit/refund that the 120-day period would begin to run; Chevron submitted all documents it deemed necessary for the grant of its refund claim; as in the Pilipinas Total case, the CIR did not notify the Chevron of the document it failed to submit, if any; there is not a single letter or notice sent to Chevron informing it of its failure to submit complete documents and/or ordering the production of the lacking documents necessary for the allowance of the claim; the CIR should have taken a positive step in apprising Chevron of the completeness and adequacy of its supporting documents considering their particular relevance in reckoning the 120-day period under Section 112(C) of the NIRC. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Chevron Holdings, Inc., [Formerly Caltex (Asia) Limited], G.R. 233301, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The Court rejects the CIR's bare claim that Chevron failed to comply with the invoicing and accounting requirements for VAT-registered persons; the CIR asserts that Chevron did not imprint the word "zero-rated" on its invoices and receipts in violation of Section 113(B) of the NIRC, as amended, in relation to Revenue Regulations No. 16-05; in its original Decision, the CTA Division explicitly stated that Chevron presented various invoices, official receipts and other documents to substantiate its reported input VAT, all of which were examined by Atty. Landicho, Court-commissioned Independent Certified Public Accountant; it sustained the findings of Atty. Landicho and disallowed the P10,977,415.30 of Chevron's claimed input VAT for failure to comply with the substantiation and invoicing requirement as prescribed under Section 110(A) and Section 113(A) and (B) of the NIRC; it is thus clear that the invoices and receipts which were not compliant with the invoicing and accounting requirements were already excluded by the CTA Division when it rendered its Decision partially granting Chevron' refund claim; Chevron has duly established its claim for refund or tax credit in the amount of P4,623,001.60 in accordance with the statutory requirement for the grant of a tax credit certificate/refund. (Id.)


- The issue of whether the failure of the taxpayer to submit all the documents enumerated in RMO No. 53-98 is fatal to its claim for VAT refund had been squarely raised and amply settled in the case of Pilipinas Total Gas, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; the CIR's reliance on RMO 53-98 is misplaced; there is nothing in Section 12 of the NIRC, RR 3-88 or RMO 53-98 itself that requires submission of the complete documents enumerated in RMO 53-98 for a grant of refund or credit of input VAT; granting that the BIR found that the documents submitted by Total Gas were inadequate, it should have notified the latter of the inadequacy by sending it a request to produce the necessary documents in order to make a just and expeditious resolution of the claim; a taxpayer's failure with the requirements listed under RMO No. 53-98 is not fatal to its claim for tax credit or refund of excess unutilized excess VAT; RMO No. 53-98 assumes relevance only on matters pertinent to an audit of tax liabilities; no application in this case since Chevron's claim is one for refund of its input tax. (Id.)

#### VOLUNTARY ARBITRATION PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES

Application of the Rules of Court 
- As ruled correctly by the CA, respondents' motion for reconsideration of the Panel's Decision had been timely filed; Section 3 of the VA Procedural Guidelines provides: SEC. 3. Directory and Suppletory Application of the Guidelines and Rules of the Court. – The rules governing the proceedings before a voluntary arbitrator shall be the subject of agreement among the parties to a labor dispute and their chosen arbitrator; in the absence of agreement on any or various aspects of the voluntary arbitration proceedings, the pertinent provisions of these Guidelines and the Revised Rules of Court shall apply by analogy or in a directory and suppletory character and effect; it clearly recognizes that the Rules of Court shall apply suppletorily or by analogy to arbitration proceedings; Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court had been properly appreciated in determining the timeliness of the filing of respondents' motion for reconsideration; the said section provides: SEC. 1. How to compute time.– In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included; if the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day; here, respondents have 10 days from February 5, 2015, the day they received a copy of the Panel's Decision, within which to file their motion for reconsideration; given that February 15, 2015, falls on a Sunday, respondents have until the next business day to file their motion for reconsideration. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

Motion for reconsideration 
- Petitioner contends that there is no motion for reconsideration which could have been considered as duly filed in this case that may be appealed to the CA as provided in Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court since respondents' motion for reconsideration had not been filed directly with the Panel in violation of Section 2, Rule III of the Revised Procedural Guidelines in the Conduct of Voluntary Arbitration Proceedings (VA Procedural Guidelines); by no stretch of the imagination can Section 2, Rule III of the VA Procedural Guidelines be given a meaning as that advanced by the petitioner; "instrumentality," defined; the terms governmental "agency" or "instrumentality" are synonymous in the sense that either of them is a means by which a government acts, or by which a certain government act or function is performed; since the Panel performs a state function pursuant to a governmental power delegated to them under the Labor Code provisions, as a governmental instrumentality, the Panel holds office at the NCMB Office and the motion for reconsideration respondents filed thereat had been proper; the denial of the motion for reconsideration was not premised on the failure to directly file the motion with the Panel as the term is understood by the petitioner, but because the Panel found the motion to be lacking in merit and filed a day late. (Borreta as widow of Deceased Manuel A. Borreta, Jr. vs. Evic Human Resource Management, Inc., et al., G.R. 224026, Feb. 3, 2020)

#### WITNESSES

Credibility of 
- AAA gave a clear account of her abuse; she narrated how Pueyo inflicted bodily injury upon her on November 4, 1997 in a candid manner, with seeming unpreparedness that could only impress upon a listener that her narrative was not rehearsed; the alleged inconsistencies were but trivial matters; case law holds with consistency that "when the victim's testimony is straightforward, convincing, and consistent with human nature and the normal course of things, unflawed by any material or significant inconsistency, it passes the test of credibility, and the accused may already be convicted solely on the basis thereof." (People vs. Pueyo alias Tito Flong, G.R. 192327, Feb. 26, 2020)


- Accused-appellant also argues that even AAA's testimony is not credible for being riddled with inconsistencies as to where the second incident occurred, whether penetration took place, his reaction when she refused to massage him, and whether AAA indeed feared him; the argument must fail; the inconsistencies pointed out by accused-appellant refer to minor details only, which do not touch upon the central fact of the crime and do not impair AAA's credibility; if at all, they serve as proof that AAA was not coached or rehearsed. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- Accused-appellant also assails AAA's credibility on her testimony that he attempted to kill her; he claims that it was dubious how AAA sustained no physical injuries if he really did attack her with a bladed weapon; these matters, however, are irrelevant to the crime charged and do not deserve consideration; People v. Nelmida teaches that "an inconsistency, which has nothing to do with the elements of a crime, is not a ground to reverse a conviction"; the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the Office of the Solicitor General's argument that it was not impossible to escape such an attack unscathed if AAA had successfully parried the bladed weapon. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Evidence to be given credence must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances; the issue of credibility, when it is decisive of the guilt or innocence of the accused, is determined by the conformity of the conflicting claims and recollections of the witnesses to common experience and to the observation of mankind as probable under the circumstances; there is no test to the truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation, and experience; whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous and is outside of judicial cognizance. (People vs. Quijano, G.R. 247558, Feb. 19, 2020)


- In assessing AAA's credibility, the Court of Appeals held that "it is against human nature for a young girl to fabricate a story that would expose herself as well as her family to a lifetime of shame" 
- effectively reiterating an outdated standard for assessing witness credibility; this Court's discussion in People v. Amarela is more timely and appropriate for this case: More often than not, where the alleged victim survives to tell her story of sexual depredation, rape cases are solely decided based on the credibility of the testimony of the private complainant; in doing so, we have hinged on the impression that no young Filipina of decent repute would publicly admit that she has been sexually abused, unless that is the truth, for it is her natural instinct to protect her honor; however, this misconception, particularly in this day and age, not only puts the accused at un unfair disadvantage, but created a travesty of justice; this opinion borders on the fallacy of non sequitur; and while the factual setting back then would have been appropriate to say it is natural for a woman to be reluctant in disclosing a sexual assault; today, we simply cannot be stuck to the Maria Clara stereotype of a demure and reserved Filipino woman; We, should stay away from such mindset and accept the realities of a woman's dynamic role in society today: she who has over the years transformed into a strong and confidently intelligent and beautiful person, willing to fight for her rights; in this way, we can evaluate the testimony of a private complainant of rape without gender bias or cultural misconception; in order for us to affirm a conviction for rape, we must believe beyond reasonable doubt the version of events narrated by the victim; thus, in Amarela, the accused was acquitted because the victim's account was improbable and married by inconsistencies, regardless of the existing preconception that a Filipino woman's honor would prevent her from lying about her ordeal. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)


- It has been held that when the issue involves matters like credibility of witnesses, the calibration of their testimonies as well as the assessment of the probative weight thereof, findings of the trial court and its conclusions anchored on said findings are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect; there being no showing that the RTC misconstrued or misapprehended any relevant fact in this case, the Court gives full respect to its findings and conclusion, which were sustained on appeal by the CA, supporting accused-appellant's conviction for Murder. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)


- Neither can the delay in reporting the incidents to the proper authorities taint her trustworthiness; a rape charge becomes doubtful only when the delay in revealing its commission is unreasonable and unexplained; AAA did not immediately report the incidents to her mother considering the moral ascendancy and influence exerted upon her by accused-appellant, whom she relied on for support of her educational needs, as well as accused-appellant's threats of bodily harm against her and her family. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- On Marietta's supposed failure to lend succor to her father who was being attacked, suffice it to state that there could be no hard and fast gauge for measuring a person's reaction or behavior when confronted with a startling, not to mention horrifying, occurrence; witnesses of startling occurrences react differently depending upon their situation and state of mind, and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or frightful experience; the workings of the human mind placed under emotional stress are unpredictable, and people react differently to shocking stimulus 
- some may shout, some may faint, and others may be plunged into insensibility. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al., G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- The failure of the victims to shout for help or escape during the incident does not impair their credibility; it is not also fatal to the prosecution's case; no standard form of behavior can be anticipated of a rape victim following her defilement, particularly a child who could not be expected to fully comprehend the ways of an adult; people react differently to emotional stress, and rape victims are no different from them; AAA was only a 13-year-old minor at the time of the incidents; given her tender age, her failure to immediately flee from accused-appellant, by itself, cannot taint her credibility as a rape victim. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- The trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal; however, this is not a hard and fast rule; the Court has reviewed the trial court's factual findings when there is a showing that the trial judge overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that would have affected the case; here, circumstances exist that raise serious doubts on accused-appellants' culpability of the crime charged. (People vs. Casilang, et al., G.R. 242159, Feb. 5, 2020)


- We affirm the factual findings and the evaluation of AAA's credibility and testimony in the absence of showing that the lower courts may have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance; when a woman, especially a minor, alleges rape, she says in effect all that is necessary to mean that she has been raped; further, youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity; a young girl's revelation that she had been raped, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere fabrication. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)


- When the credibility of the eyewitness is at issue, due deference and respect shall be given to the trial court's factual findings, its calibration of the testimonies, its assessment of their probative weight, and its conclusions based on such factual findings, absent any showing that it had overlooked circumstances that would have affected the final outcome of the case; this rule finds an even more stringent application where the trial court's findings are sustained by the Court of Appeals. (People vs. Pigar @ "Jerry", et al. vs. Pigar @ "Biroy," G.R. 247658, Feb. 17, 2020)


- While accused-appellant attempts to cast doubt on the credibility of the prosecution's witnesses, the settled rule is that the trial court's determination of witness credibility will not be disturbed on appeal unless significant matters have been overlooked; such determination is treated with respect, as the trial court has the opportunity to observe the witnesses' demeanor during trial; its findings assume ever greater weight when they are affirmed by the Court of Appeals; the Regional Trial Court found AAA's testimony credible and sufficiently corroborated; her straightforward and positive testimony that her grandfather raped her, Barangay Captain Lotec's testimony stating that she was "pale and trembling," the medical certificate indicating lacerations to her hymen, and accused-appellant's own admission of the paternal relationship between him and the victim were collectively deemed sufficient for conviction; these findings were then affirmed by the Court of Appeals, which found AAA to be unwavering in "the material points of her testimony"; the lower courts' findings on AAA's credibility should be upheld, more so in view of accused-appellant's failure to raise any cogent reason for reversal. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 229209, Feb. 12, 2020)

Discrepancies or inconsistencies between affidavit and testimony 
- The claimed discrepancies refer to trivial matters which neither negate nor disprove the commission of the alleged offenses; accused-appellant himself admitted that his store is merely 15 meters away from AAA's house; the distance between accused-appellant's house and AAA's house, as well as his store and AAA's house, was not of such nature as to render it impossible for him to commit the subject offenses; there is no discrepancy as to the exact number of instances accused-appellant raped AAA since the latter candidly admitted in her testimony the fact that she could not remember the precise number of times she was molested but it always happened on a Saturday; discrepancies or inconsistencies between a witness' affidavit and testimony do not necessarily impair the latter's credibility as affidavits are taken ex parte and are often incomplete or inaccurate for lack or absence of searching inquiries by the investigating officer; in the event of any inconsistency between a witness' affidavit and testimony in court, as in this case, the latter shall prevail. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 233463, Feb. 19, 2020)

State witness 
- As to the discharge of an accused as state witness, the Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that: (1) there is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused whose discharge is requested; (2) there is no other direct evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of said accused; (3) the testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated in its material points; (4) said accused does not appear to be the most guilty; and (5) said accused has not at any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude. (People vs. P/Insp. Dongail, et al., G.R. 217972, Feb. 17, 2020)

Testimony of 
- Credence is accorded to the testimony of Ernie, who positively identified accused-appellant as the one who stabbed his father; the alleged inconsistency between Ernie's affidavit and his testimony in open court does not affect his credibility as it does not detract from the fact that he saw and identified accused-appellant as the assailant of his father; a sworn statement or an affidavit does not purport to contain a complete compendium of the details of the event narrated by the affiant; sworn statements taken ex parte are generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court. (People vs. Dela Peña, G.R. 238120, Feb. 12, 2020)

#### ACTIONS



Accion interdictal 
- An accion interdictal comprises two distinct causes of action, forcible entry and unlawful detainer; they are distinguished mainly by the nature of the deforciant's entry into the property; in forcible entry, possession is illegal at the outset, as entry was effected through force, intimidation, strategy, threats, or stealth; on the other hand, in unlawful detainer, possession is initially lawful as it stems from an express or implied contract, but subsequently becomes illegal when the deforciant withholds possession after the expiration or termination of his/her right; both actions for forcible entry and unlawful detainer must be brought within one year from the date of actual entry on the land, or from the date of last demand, as the case may be. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)




- An accion interdictal is a summary action that determines the right to physical possession, independent of ownership; it is cognizable by the proper Municipal or Metropolitan Trial Court. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



Accion publiciana 
- An accion publiciana is a plenary action to recover the right of possession, and is brought before the proper RTC when the dispossession has lasted for more than one year; it is an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession independent of title. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



Accion reivindicatoria 
- An accion reivindicatoria is a suit to recover possession of a parcel of land as an element of ownership; it is filed before the proper Regional Trial Court; the judgment in said case determines the ownership of the property and awards possession to the lawful owner. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



Breach of contract of carriage 
- In cases of damages resulting from maritime collision, the Civil Code provisions on common carrier are applicable if the cause of action is based on contract of carriage. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



Cause of action 
- Section 2, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court defines a "cause of action" as the act or omission by which a party violates a right of another; the essential elements of a cause of action are: (1) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created; (2) an obligation on the part of the defendant not to violate such right; and (3) an act or omission on the part of the defendant in violation of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff. (Bank of the Philippine Islands vs. Bacalla, Jr., et al., G.R. 223404, July 15, 2020)



The elementary rule is that the allegations in the complaint determine the cause of action. (Spouses Viovicente vs. Spouses Viovicente, et al., G.R. 219074, July 28, 2020)



Civil action under Article 33 
- Article 33 "contemplates a civil action for the recovery of damages that is entirely unrelated to the purely criminal aspect of the case"; even the quantum of proof required, preponderance of evidence, as opposed to the proof beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases is different, confirming that the civil action under Article 33 is independent of the criminal action; reservation of the right to separately file a civil action for damages under Article 33 need not even be made. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



Article 33 is explicit that in cases of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, the civil action is "entirely separate and distinct from the criminal action" and shall "proceed independently of the criminal prosecution." (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



The civil action under Article 33 may be pursued before the filing of the criminal case, during the pendency of the criminal case, or even after the criminal case is resolved; the only limitation is that an offended party cannot "recover damages twice for the same act or omission" of the defendant. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



Moot and academic case 
- A case is moot when a supervening event has terminated the legal issue between the parties, such that this Court is left with nothing to resolve;
it can no longer grant any relief or enforce any right, and anything it says on the matter will have no practical use or value. (Express Telecommunications Co., Inc. (EXTELCOM) vs. AZ Communications, Inc., G.R. 196902, July 13, 2020)



In Ilusorio v. Baguio Country Club Corporation, this Court discussed that while one issue in the case became moot, the case should not be automatically dismissed if there are other issues raised that need resolving; however, a case should not be dismissed simply because one of the issues raised therein had become moot and academic by the onset of a supervening event, whether intended or incidental, if there are other causes which need to be resolved after trial; when a case is dismissed without the other substantive issues in the case having been resolved would be tantamount to a denial of the right of the plaintiff to due process. (Express Telecommunications Co., Inc. (EXTELCOM) vs. AZ Communications, Inc., G.R. 196902, July 13, 2020)



Moldex also enumerated other instances when this Court may rule on moot cases:

(1) Grave constitutional violations; (2) Exceptional character of the case;

(3) Paramount public interest; (4) The case presents an opportunity to guide the bench, the bar, and the public; or (5) The case is capable of repetition yet evading review; none of these exceptions are present in this case. (Express Telecommunications Co., Inc. (EXTELCOM) vs. AZ Communications, Inc., G.R. 196902, July 13, 2020)



Peñafrancia Sugar Mill, Inc. v. Sugar Regulatory Administration: a case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use; in such instance, there is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition. (Express Telecommunications Co., Inc. (EXTELCOM) vs. AZ Communications, Inc., G.R. 196902, July 13, 2020)



Without any legal relief that may be granted, courts generally decline to resolve moot cases, lest the ruling result in a mere advisory opinion; this rule stems from this Court's judicial power, which is limited to settling actual cases and controversies involving legally demandable and enforceable rights. (Express Telecommunications Co., Inc. (EXTELCOM) vs. AZ Communications, Inc., G.R. 196902, July 13, 2020)



#### ADMINISTRATIVE LAW



Administrative case 
- The demise of the respondent in administrative cases does not generally preclude the finding of administrative liability, and while there are jurisprudentially recognized exceptions to the rule, none are present in this case; the resolution of an administrative case may continue notwithstanding the death of the respondent if the latter has been given the opportunity to be heard, or in
instances where the continuance thereof will be more advantageous and beneficial to the respondent's heirs, as in this case. (Heirs of Nelson Cabrera Buenaflor, namely, Pura R. Buenaflor, et al. vs. Field Investigation Office, Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. 232844, July 7, 2020)



Doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies 
- A purely legal issue allows the relaxation of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Federation of Golf Clubs of the Philippines, Inc., G.R. 226449, July 28, 2020)



Generally, relief to the courts of justice is not sanctioned when the law provides for remedies against the action of an administrative board, body, or officer; the availability of such remedy prevents the petitioners from resorting to a petition for certiorari and prohibition, being extraordinary remedies; however, exceptions to this rule allow the deviation from such procedural rule; among which is when the question raised is purely legal in nature. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



Signature of head of agency 
- The mere signature of the head of agency in a certification without anything more cannot be considered a presumption of liability, for liability depends upon the wrong committed and not solely by reason of being the head of the government agency. (Linsangan vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 234260, July 1, 2020)



#### AGENCY



Contract of 
- A registered owner who places in the possession of another an SPA and the owner‘s duplicates of the certificate of titles, effectively represents to a third party that the holder of such documents has the requisite authority to deal with the property. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



Article 1900 of the Civil Code expressly states that "so far as third persons are concerned, an act is deemed to have been performed within the scope of the agent's authority, if such act is within the terms of the power of attorney, as written, even if the agent has in fact exceeded the limits of his authority according to an understanding between the principal and the agent." (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



Doctrine of apparent authority 
- As explained in Woodchild Holdings, Inc. v. Roxas Electric and Construction Co., Inc.: it bears stressing that apparent authority is based on estoppel and can arise from two instances: first, the principal may knowingly permit the agent to so hold himself out as having such authority, and in this way, the principal becomes estopped to claim that the agent does not have

such authority; second, the principal may so clothe the agent with the indicia of authority as to lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that he actually has such authority. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)

Even if the agent exceeded his authority under the SPA, the principal must be bound by the mortgages executed by the former, for "as between two innocent persons, one of whom must suffer the consequences of a breach of trust, the one who made it possible by his act of confidence must bear the loss." (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



For the principle of apparent authority to apply, the petitioner was burdened to prove the following: (a) the acts of the respondent justifying belief in the agency by the petitioner; (b) knowledge thereof by the respondent which is sought to be held; and, (c) reliance thereon by the petitioner consistent with ordinary care and prudence. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



There can be no apparent authority of an agent without acts or conduct on the part of the principal and such acts or conduct of the principal must have been known and relied upon in good faith and as a result of the exercise of reasonable prudence by a third person as claimant and such must have produced a change of position to its detriment; the apparent power of an agent is to be determined by the acts of the principal and not by the acts of the agent. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



#### AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES



Abuse of superior strength 
- The appreciation of the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength depends on the age, size and strength of the parties; in a long line of cases, the Court has consistently held that an attack made by a man with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed and defenseless woman constitutes the circumstance of abuse of that superiority which his sex and the weapon used in the act afforded him, and from which the woman was unable to defend herself. (People vs. Serafin, G.R. 246197, July 29, 2020)



The circumstances of abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is inequality of force between the victim and the aggressor, assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously advantageous for the aggressor, and the latter takes advantage of it in the commission of the crime; evidence must show that the assailants consciously sought the advantage or that they had the deliberate intent to use this advantage. (Id.)



Treachery 
- The essence of treachery lies in the nature of an attack done deliberately and without warning; it must be done in a swift and unexpected manner, giving
the hapless, unarmed and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape. (People vs. Alcala, et al., G.R. 233319, July 7, 2020)



#### ALIBI



Defense of 
- For the defense of alibi to prosper, it must be sufficiently convincing as to preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the locus criminis or its immediate vicinity at the time of the incident. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



#### ALIBI AND DENIAL



Defenses of 
- As regards, the defense of alibi, We have pronounced time and again that both denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witness that the accused committed the crime; as between a categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a mere denial and alibi on the other, the former is generally held to prevail. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



The defenses of alibi and denial, if unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence, are inherently weak, self-serving, and undeserving of weight in law. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 234157, July 15, 2020)



#### ANTI-GRAFT AND CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (R.A. 3019)



Application 
- It has long been settled that private individuals may be sued and indicted together with the co-conspiring public officer in abidance with the policy of R.A. 3019; Section 9 of R.A. 3019 concretizes the conclusion that the anti- graft practices law applies to both public and private individuals; it is also worthy to mention that by its nature, violation of Section 3 (d) of R.A. 3019 is considered malum prohibitum. (Villanueva, et al. vs. People, G.R. 237864, July 8, 2020)



Corrupt practices of public officers 
- For one to be found guilty of corrupt practices of public officers, under Section 3(d) of R.A. 3019, the following elements must be present and proven beyond reasonable doubt: (a) the accused is a public officer;
(b) he or she accepted or has a member of his or her family who accepted employment in a private enterprise; and, (c) such private enterprise has a pending official business with the public officer during the pendency of official business or within one year from its termination. (Villanueva, et al. vs. People, G.R. 237864, July 8, 2020)



Section 3(e) 
- A violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 may be committed in three
(3) ways, i.e., through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; proof of any of these three (3) in connection with the prohibited acts

mentioned in Section 3(e) is enough to convict. (People vs. Bacaltos, G.R. 248701, July 28, 2020)



Elements of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019, which are: (a) the accused must be a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official functions;

(b) he must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence; and (c) his action caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions. (Coloma, Jr. vs. People, et al., G.R. 233152, July 13, 2020)



(Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al. G.R. Nos. 204978- 83, July 6, 2020)



Fonacier v. Sandiganbayan expounded on the different modes of committing the offense penalized under Section 3(e), viz.: "partiality" is synonymous with "bias" which "excites a disposition to see and report matters as they are wished for rather than as they are"; "bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong; a breach of sworn duty through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of fraud"; "gross negligence has been so defined as negligence characterized by the want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally with a conscious indifference to consequences in so far as other persons may be affected. (People vs. Bacaltos, G.R. 248701, July 28, 2020)



There are two ways by which Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 may be violated, that is, through manifest partiality, or with evident bad faith, or through gross inexcusable negligence, namely: (a) by causing undue injury to any party, including the Government; or (b) by giving any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference. (Coloma, Jr. vs. People, et al., G.R. 233152, July 13, 2020)



To sustain a conviction for violation of Sec. 3(e) of R.A. 3019, the prosecution must sufficiently establish the following elements: (1) the offender is a public officer; (2) the act was done in the discharge of the public officer's official, administrative, or judicial functions; (3) the act was done through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or gross inexcusable negligence; and (4) the public officer caused any undue injury to any party, including the government, or gave any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference. (People vs. Bacaltos, G.R. 248701, July 28, 2020)



#### ANTI-SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACT OF 1995 (R.A. 7877)



Application 
- Aside from the actual perpetrator, the employer, or the head of office or institution may also be impleaded in an independent action for damages; they
would be solidarily liable for damages if they did not take immediate action on a sexual harassment complaint; Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7877 requires the employer or head of office to promulgate appropriate rules and regulations to prevent the commission of acts of sexual harassment and to provide procedures for the resolution, settlement or prosecution of acts of sexual harassment. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Republic Act No. 7877, otherwise known as the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995, was the first criminal statute enacted in the Philippines to penalize sexual harassment; it was adopted pursuant to the declared policy that "the State shall value the dignity of every individual, enhance the development of its human resources, guarantee full respect for human rights, and uphold the dignity of workers, employees, applicants for employment, students or those undergoing training, instruction or education." (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)

Section 4(b) of Republic Act No. 7877 further requires employers and heads of offices to create a "committee on decorum and investigation of cases on sexual harassment"; pursuant to this, all national or local agencies of the government, state colleges and universities, including government-owned or controlled corporations, were required to create their own Committee on Decorum and Investigation. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Under Republic Act No. 7877, an act of sexual harassment may result in three distinct liabilities: criminal, civil, and administrative; an action for each can proceed independently of the others; in a criminal action, the accused is prosecuted for a wrong committed against society itself or the State whose law he or she violated; in a civil action, a defendant is sued by the plaintiff in an effort to correct a private wrong; the purpose of an administrative action, on the other hand, is to protect the public service by imposing administrative sanctions to an erring public officer. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Penalties 
- Conviction under Republic Act No. 7877 subjects the offender to criminal penalties; under Section 7, any person who violates the law shall, upon conviction, be penalized by imprisonment of not less than one (1) month nor more than six (6) months, or a fine of not less than ₱10,000.00 nor more than
₱20,000.00, or both such fine and imprisonment at the discretion of the court. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Separate civil action 
- Criminal liability for sexual harassment notwithstanding, the offended party may pursue a separate civil action; civil liability arises from the damage or injury caused by the felonious act; in a civil action, the real party plaintiff is the offended party, while in a criminal action, the plaintiff is the "People of the Philippines." (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Sexual harassment 
- At the core of sexual harassment in the workplace is power exercised by a superior over a subordinate; the power emanates from how the
superior can remove or disadvantage the subordinate should the latter refuse the superior's sexual advances. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Sexual harassment as defined and penalized under Republic Act No. 7877 requires three elements for an accused to be convicted: (1) that the employer, employee, manager, supervisor, agent of the employer, teacher, instructor, professor, coach, trainor, or any other person has authority, influence, or moral ascendancy over another; (2) the authority, influence, or moral ascendancy exists in a work-related, training-related, or education-related environment, and (3) the employer, employee, manager, supervisor, agent of the employer, teacher, instructor, professor, coach, trainor, or any other person who has authority, influence, or moral-ascendancy over another makes a demand, request, or requirement of a sexual favor. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Sexual harassment is committed when the sexual favor is made as a condition in the hiring of the victim or the grant of benefits thereto; or when the sexual act results in an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for the employee. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Since Republic Act No. 7877 is a special criminal statute, the offense of sexual harassment is malum prohibitum; thus, in prosecuting an offender for sexual harassment, intent is immaterial; mere commission is sufficient to warrant a conviction. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



There is no time period within which a victim is expected to complain about sexual harassment; the time to do so may vary depending upon the needs, circumstances, and more importantly, the emotional threshold of the employee. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



#### ANTI- TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS ACT OF 2003 (R.A. 9208)



Prostitution 
- Refers to any act, transaction, scheme or design involving the use of a person by another, for sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct in exchange for money, profit or any other consideration. (People vs. Amurao, G.R. 229514, July 28, 2020)



Qualified trafficking 
- According to the definition laid down in Section 3 (b) of R.A. 9208, a child refers to a person below eighteen (18) years of age; considering that eleven (11) of the victims were minors, the offense becomes qualified as the persons being trafficked were children; if the crime was committed in large scale as it was committed against three (3) or more persons, individually or as a group, it is also qualified. (People vs. Leocadio, et al., G.R. 237697, July 15, 2020)



It was held in People v. Villanueva that a conviction for qualified trafficking in persons may stand even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the

first paragraph of Sec. 3(a) of R.A. 9208; if the person trafficked is a child, we may do away with discussions on whether or not the second element was actually proven; it has been recognized that even without the perpetrator's use of coercive, abusive, or deceptive means, a minor's consent is not given out of his or her own free will. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 234157, July 15, 2020)



Section 3(a) of R.A. 9208, as amended, defines "Trafficking in Persons" as follows: it refers to the recruitment, obtaining, hiring, providing, transportation, transfer, maintaining, harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the persons, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs. (People vs. Oledan, G.R. 240692, July 15, 2020)



The elements of the crime of trafficking in persons are the following: 1. The act of "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders"; 2. The means used which may include "threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another"; and 3. The purpose of trafficking which includes "exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs; the crime is then qualified when the trafficked person is a child below 18 years of age or one over 18 but is unable to fully take care or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 234157, July 15, 2020)



Trafficking in persons 
- In People of the Philippines v. Nancy Lasaca Ramirez, this Court enumerated the elements that must be established to successfully prosecute the crime: the elements of trafficking in persons can be derived from its definition under Section 3 (a) of Republic Act No. 9208, thus: (1) the act of ―recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim‘s consent or knowledge, within or across national borders;‖ (2) the means used which include ―threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another‖; and (3) the purpose of trafficking is exploitation which includes ―exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery,

servitude or the removal or sale of organs.‖ (People vs. Leocadio, et al., G.R. 237697, July 15, 2020)



In People v. Casio, the Court defined the elements of Trafficking in Persons, as follows: (1) the act of "recruitment, transportation, transfer or harbouring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim's consent or knowledge, within or across national borders"; (2) the means used which include "threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another‖; and (3) The purpose of trafficking is exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs." (People vs. Amurao, G.R. 229514, July 28, 2020)



It shall be unlawful for any person, natural or juridical, to commit any of the following acts: (a) To recruit, transport, transfer, harbor, provide, or receive a person by any means, including those done under the pretext of domestic or overseas employment or training or apprenticeship, for the purpose of prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage; under Section 6(a) of R.A. 9208, the crime is qualified when the trafficked person is a child, which is defined as a person below the age of 18 years old or above 18 years old but is unable to fully take care of or protect himself/herself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation, or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. (People vs. Amurao, G.R. 229514, July 28, 2020)



R.A. 9208, being the law that defines the crime of Trafficking in Persons, read as follows: Section 3. Definition of Terms, as used in this Act: (a) Trafficking in Persons refers to the recruitment, transportation, transfer or harboring, or receipt of persons with or without the victim‘s consent or knowledge, within or across national borders by means of threat or use of force, or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of position, taking advantage of the vulnerability of the person, or, the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for the purpose of exploitation which includes at a minimum, the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude or the removal or sale of organs. (People vs. Amurao, G.R. 229514, July 28, 2020)



(People vs. Leocadio, et al., G.R. 237697, July 15, 2020)



The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall also be considered as ―trafficking in persons‖ even if it does not involve any of the means set forth in the preceding paragraph. (People vs. Leocadio, et al., G.R. 237697, July 15, 2020)



#### ANTI-VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN ACT OF 2004 (R.A. NO.

9262)



Application of 
- Section 5 enumerates the various "acts of violence against women and their children," generally defined as: SECTION 3. Definition of Terms. 
- any act or a series of acts committed by any person against a woman who is his wife, former wife, or against a woman with whom the person has or had a sexual or dating relationship, or with whom he has a common child, or against her child whether legitimate or illegitimate, within or without the family abode, which result in or is likely to result in physical, sexual, psychological harm or suffering, or economic abuse including threats of such acts, battery, assault, coercion, harassment or arbitrary deprivation of liberty; paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of Section 5 specifically refer to acts of "physical violence," which, under the law, includes "acts that include bodily or physical harm.‖ (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 9262, or the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children Act of 2004: SECTION 5. Acts of Violence Against Women and Their Children. 
- The crime of violence against women and their children is committed through any of the following acts: (a) Causing physical harm to the woman or her child; (b) Threatening to cause the woman or her child physical harm; (c) Attempting to cause the woman or her child physical harm. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



#### APPEALS



Appeal from the decisions of quasi-judicial agencies 
- Guidelines laid down by this Court for the judicial review of decisions rendered by administrative agencies in the exercise of their quasi-judicial powers: first, the burden is on the complainant to prove by substantial evidence the allegations in his complaint; second, in reviewing administrative decisions of the executive branch of the government, the findings of facts made therein are to be respected so long as they are supported by substantial evidence; third, administrative decisions in matters within the executive jurisdiction can only be set aside on proof of gross abuse of discretion, fraud, or error of law. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



Appeal from the decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals 
- The Court shall not disturb its findings without any showing of grave abuse of discretion considering that the members of the tax court are in the best position to analyze the documents presented by the parties. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Deutsche Knowledge Services Pte. Ltd., G.R. 234445, July 15, 2020)



Appeal from the decisions of the Ombudsman 
- Being a non-trier of facts, this Court generally defers to the sound judgment of the OMB except if it has been made
with grave abuse of discretion. (Sombero, Jr. vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. Nos. 237888 & 237904, July 28, 2020)



Appeal from the decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative and criminal cases 
- The prevailing rule is that the petition for certiorari questioning the criminal incident of the case should be filed with the Supreme Court and not with the CA. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



When the ombudsman had rendered a consolidated decision on administrative and criminal charges, the aggrieved party could assail the administrative aspect of the decision by filing a Rule 43 petition for review with the Court of Appeals when the right to appeal is available, or assail the criminal aspect by filing a Rule 65 certiorari petition with the Supreme Court. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



Appeal from the decisions of the Ombudsman in administrative cases 
- The decision of the Ombudsman in administrative charges imposing the penalty of public censure or reprimand, or suspension of not more than one (1) month's salary shall be final and unappealable, subject to judicial review before the Court of Appeals via petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, on the ground of grave abuse of discretion; where the penalty imposed for administrative charges is not merely public censure or reprimand, or suspension of not more than one (1) month's salary, the Ombudsman's decision is appealable before the Court of Appeals under Rule 43 of the Rules of Court; the Ombudsman rulings which exonerate the respondent from administrative liability are, by implication, considered final and unappealable. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



Appeal from the decisions of the Ombudsman in criminal cases 
- In cases when the aggrieved party is questioning the Office of the Ombudsman‘s findings of lack of probable cause, as in this case, there is likewise the remedy of certiorari under Rule 65 to be filed with this Court and not with the Court of Appeals following our ruling in Perez v. Office of the Ombudsman. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



Kuizon and the subsequent case of Mendoza-Arce v. Office of the Ombudsman (Visayas) drove home the point that the remedy of aggrieved parties from resolutions of the Office of the Ombudsman finding probable cause in criminal cases or non-administrative cases, when tainted with grave abuse of discretion, is to file an original action for certiorari with this Court and not with the Court of Appeals. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



With respect to criminal charges, the Court has settled that the remedy of an aggrieved party from a resolution of the Ombudsman finding the presence or

absence of probable cause is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court and the petition should be filed not before the CA, but before the Supreme Court. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



Appeal from the Labor Arbiter's decision 
- Article 223 of the Labor Code, which sets forth the rules on appeal from the Labor Arbiter's decision, provides: ART. 229
(223) Appeal. - Decisions, awards, or orders of the Labor Arbiter are final and executory unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten

(10) calendar days from receipt of such decisions, awards, or orders. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



Appeal from the Regional Trial Courts 
- Clerks of court are indispensable in enabling parties to perfect appeals by record on appeal, such that, in those cases where records are found to be incomplete, they are tasked to take such measures as may be required to complete the records; dismissal of the appeal for failure to include the record of appeal, not proper where such failure was due to the branch clerk of court‘s non-feasance and bad faith. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Appeal in criminal cases 
- In so disposing, the Court considers, as is true in all appeals from conviction of crimes, any fact or circumstance in the accused-appellant's favor regardless of whether such fact or circumstance was raised as a defense or assigned as an error and despite the similar pronouncement of guilt by both the trial court and the appellate court; every appeal of a criminal conviction opens the entire record to the reviewing court which should itself determine whether the findings adverse to the accused should be upheld or struck down in his favor. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



It is settled that an appeal in criminal cases opens the entire case for review, and it is the duty of the reviewing tribunal to correct, cite and appreciate errors in the appealed judgment, whether they are assigned or unassigned. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020)



Dismissal of appeal 
- In appeals of criminal cases before the CA, the appellant's failure to timely file his or her brief is a ground for the dismissal of an appeal; this is authorized by Section 8, Rule 124 of the Rules; the dismissal of an appeal based on the foregoing provisions is in accord with the well-settled principle that "the right to appeal is not a natural right or a part of due process; it is merely a statutory privilege, and may be exercised only in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of law.‖ (Tamboa vs. People, G.R. 248264, July 27, 2020)



Factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial agencies 
- For factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, including labor tribunals, are accorded much respect as they are specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction especially when supported by substantial evidence; the rule, however,
is not ironclad and a departure therefrom may be warranted where the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are contrary to the findings and conclusions of the quasi-judicial agency, as in this case. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



It is well-settled that findings of fact of an administrative agency, like the LA and the NLRC, which has acquired expertise in the particular field of its endeavor, are accorded great weight on appeal; the Court has consistently ruled that the factual findings and conclusion of the NLRC are generally accorded not only great weight and respect but even clothed with finality and deemed binding on the Court as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



The general rule is that factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial bodies, which include labor tribunals, are accorded much respect by this Court as they are specialized to rule on matters falling within their jurisdiction especially when these are supported by substantial evidence. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al.,

G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



Factual findings of the Commission on Audit 
- It is the general policy of the Court to sustain the decisions of administrative authorities, especially one which is constitutionally-created not only on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed expertise in the laws that they are entrusted to enforce. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Factual findings of the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) 
- In Shinryo (Phils.) Company, Inc. v. RRN, Inc., the Court held that factual findings of construction arbitrators may be reviewed by this Court when the petitioner proves affirmatively that: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality or corruption of the arbitrators or any of them; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; (4) one or more of the arbitrators were disqualified to act as such under Section nine of Republic Act No. 876 and willfully refrained from disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or

(5) the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was not made; other recognized exceptions are as follows: (1) when there is a very clear showing of grave abuse of discretion resulting in lack or loss of jurisdiction as when a party was deprived of a fair opportunity to present its position before the Arbitral Tribunal or when an award is obtained through fraud or the corruption of arbitrators, (2) when the findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the CIAC, and (3) when a party is deprived of administrative due process; We find that none of the above-mentioned circumstances exists in

this case. (Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Italian-Thai Development Public Company, Ltd., et al., G.R. 235853, July 13, 2020)



Section 1, Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court expressly states that a petition for review on certiorari under this Rule shall raise only pure a question of law, which must be distinctly set forth; this Rule is complemented by Section 19 of the Construction Industry Arbitration Law which states that CIAC arbitral awards may only be assailed on pure questions of law: SEC. 19. Finality of Awards. -The arbitral award shall be binding upon the parties. It shall be final and unappealable except on questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court. (Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Italian-Thai Development Public Company, Ltd., et al., G.R. 235853, July 13, 2020)



The court is duty-bound to uphold the integrity of the arbitration process and ensure that the parties do not undermine the process they voluntarily engaged themselves in, unless the party claiming for exception shows that any of the exceptional circumstances exists. (Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Italian-Thai Development Public Company, Ltd., et al., G.R. 235853, July 13, 2020)



The court will not permit the parties to relitigate before it the issues of facts previously presented and argued before the arbitral tribunal, save only where a very clear showing is made that, in reaching its factual conclusions, the arbitral tribunal committed an error so egregious and hurtful to one party as to constitute a grave abuse of discretion, such as where it was shown that the party was deprived of a fair opportunity to present its position before the arbitral tribunal or that the award was obtained through fraud or corruption of arbitrators. (Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Italian-Thai Development Public Company, Ltd., et al., G.R. 235853, July 13, 2020)



The factual findings of the CIAC, which possesses the required expertise in the field of construction arbitration, are final and conclusive and are not reviewable by the Court on appeal, as the Court is duty-bound to ensure that an appeal does not undermine the integrity of arbitration or the process which the parties voluntarily elected to engage in, or conveniently set aside the conclusions made by the arbitral tribunal. (Department of Public Works and Highways vs. Italian- Thai Development Public Company, Ltd., et al., G.R. 235853, July 13, 2020)



Factual findings of the Court of Appeals 
- As laid down by the Court in Dimaapi, et al. v. Golden Bell Loans and Credit Corporation, et al., the following four rigid parameters limit the giving of due course and granting of review or appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules: (1) only questions of law, which must be distinctly set forth in the petition, shall be raised (Section 1, Rule 45);

(2) to avoid the outright dismissal of the petition, there must be compliance with the payment of the docket and other required fees, deposit for costs, proof of proper service of the petition, the required contents of the petition, and the

required documents that must accompany the petition (Sections 4 and 5, Rule 45);

(3) the Court may on its own initiative deny the appeal by certiorari on the ground that it is without merit or is prosecuted manifestly for delay, or that the questions therein are too insubstantial to require consideration (second paragraph, Section 5, Rule 45); and (4) a review by certiorari is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, and will be granted only where there are special and important considerations by reason of substance "when the court a quo has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the Supreme Court, or decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court" or procedure "when the court a quo has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by the lower court, as to call for an exercise of the power of supervision" (Section 6, Rule 45). (Ususan Development Corporation, represented by Atty. Roel A. Pacio vs. Republic, G.R. 209462, July 15, 2020)



Factual findings of the Regional Trial Courts 
- While generally, the findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive upon this Court, a careful examination of the records of the case reveals that the lower courts overlooked some significant facts and circumstances which, if considered in their true light, compels Abueva's exoneration. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



Factual findings of the trial courts 
- Factual findings of the trial court, including its assessment of the credibility of witnesses, probative weight of their testimonies, as well as of the documentary evidence, are accorded great weight and respect, especially when the same are affirmed by the CA. (People vs. Amurao, G.R. 229514, July 28, 2020)



Factual findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect; these findings will not be disturbed in the absence of any clear showing that the trial court overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances; this is because trial provides judges with the "opportunity to detect, consciously or unconsciously, observable cues and micro expressions that could, more than the words said and taken as a whole, suggest sincerity or betray lies and ill will." (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Including its evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, must be accorded respect and not be disturbed on appeal, except when the trial court is shown to have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and significance, which, if considered, would have affected the result of the case. (ABC vs. People, G.R. 241591, July 8, 2020)



Petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 
- A petition for review is limited to questions of law; the Court does not re-examine conflicting
evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute the findings of fact of the NLRC, an administrative body that has expertise in its specialized field; factual findings of the NLRC, when affirmed by the CA, are generally conclusive on the Court. (Martinez vs. OSG Ship Management Manila, Inc. (Substituted by Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc.), et al., G.R. 237373, July 29, 2020)



A petition for review on certiorari shall only raise questions of law; this Court may only delve into the facts of the case if there is a clear misapprehension of facts or when the inference drawn from the facts is manifestly mistaken. (Bautista (substituted by his son and legal representative, Philip De Vera Bautista), et al. vs. Spouses Balolong, et al., G.R. 243296, July 29, 2020)



A question of fact requires this Court to review the truth or falsity of the allegations of the parties, which includes assessment of the probative value of the evidence presented, or when the issue presented before this Court is the correctness of the lower courts‘ appreciation of the evidence presented by the parties. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



As a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition; this Court is not a trier of facts, and it will not delve into factual questions already settled by the lower courts; while this rule admits exceptions, the party must demonstrate and prove that the petition falls under the exceptions. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



As a rule, the jurisdiction of the Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are completely devoid of support from the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a gross misapprehension of facts. (Palafox, represented by his attorney-in-fact, Efraim B. Orodio vs. Wangdali, et al., G.R. 235914, July 29, 2020)



Basic is the rule that factual issues are improper in Rule 45 petitions as only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari; this Court is not a trier of facts and will not review the factual findings of the lower tribunals as these are final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and upon this Court when supported by substantial evidence. (American Express Transnational (now American International Tours, Inc.), et al. vs. Borre, G.R. 228320, July 15, 2020)



Consistent therewith is the doctrine that this Court is not a trier of facts, and this is strictly adhered to in labor cases; however, where, like in the instant case, there is a conflict between the factual findings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, on one hand, and those of the CA, on the other hand, it becomes proper for this Court, in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction, to review the facts and re-examine the records of the case. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



In a Rule 45 Petition of a Rule 65 ruling, this Court does not resolve factual issues except in ascertaining whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the Commission did or did not gravely abuse its discretion in deciding the labor case; this Court generally resolves questions of law because it is not a trier of facts. (Jacob vs. First Step Manpower Int'l Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 229984, July 8, 2020)



In a Rule 45 review, the Court examines the correctness of the CA's Decision in contrast with the review of jurisdictional errors under Rule 65; Rule 45 limits the review to questions of law; in ruling for legal correctness, the Court views the CA Decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari was presented to the CA. (The Heirs of Reynaldo A. Andag, namely Veneranda B. Andag, et al. vs. DMC Construction Equipment Resources Inc., et al., G.R. 244361, July 13, 2020)



(Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



In cases of appeals from the Sandiganbayan, like this one, only questions of law and not questions of fact may be raised; and, absent any showing that they come under the established exceptions, the Sandiganbayan's findings on the aforesaid matters remain conclusive and binding to the Court. (Coloma, Jr. vs. People, et al., G.R. 233152, July 13, 2020)



It is not this Court's task to go over the proofs presented below to ascertain if they were weighed correctly; while it is widely held that this rule of limited jurisdiction admits of exceptions, none exists in the instant case. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



It is settled that only questions of law may be raised on appeal under this remedy for the reason that this Court is not a trier of facts; nevertheless, this Court may review the facts where: (1) the findings and conclusions of the LA, on one hand, and the NLRC and the CA, on the other, are inconsistent on material and substantial points; (2) the findings of the NLRC and the CA are capricious and arbitrary; and (3) the CA's findings that are premised on a supposed absence of evidence are in fact contradicted by the evidence on record. (Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc./Tiwi Consolidated Union (APRI-TCU) on Behalf of Fe R. Rubio, et al. vs. Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc., et al., G.R. 237036, July 8, 2020)



It is well-settled that only questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court; the Court is not a trier of facts and does not routinely examine the evidence presented by the contending parties; nevertheless, the divergence of findings of fact by the LA on the one hand, and the NLRC and the CA on the other, is a recognized exception for the Court to

open and scrutinize the records to determine whether the CA, in the exercise of its certiorari jurisdiction, erred in affirming the NLRC ruling that petitioner was not a regular employee but a contracted officer of the company, and that he was not illegally dismissed. (Magtibay vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al., G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



Labor cases are elevated to this Court through Rule 45 petitions, following Rule 65 petitions decided by the Court of Appeals on rulings made by the National Labor Relations Commission; from this, two (2) chief considerations become apparent: (1) the general injunction that Rule 45 petitions are limited to questions of law; and (2) that the more basic underlying issue is the National Labor Relations Commission's potential grave abuse of its discretion; in labor disputes then, this Court may only resolve the matter of whether the Court of Appeals erred in determining "the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and deciding other jurisdictional errors of the National Labor Relations Commission." (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



Only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition; as this Court is not a trier of facts, the lower courts' factual findings are generally binding upon it. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



The Court reiterates that in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, its jurisdiction is generally limited to reviewing errors of law; it must be emphasized that the Court is not a trier of facts, and this applies with greater force in labor cases. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



The court's jurisdiction is limited to errors of law, as it is not its function to examine the evidence all over again; if the lower courts' findings are not shown to be unsupported by evidence or based on a gross misapprehension of facts, their factual conclusions shall be respected. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



The petition must perforce be denied on this basis because "one, the petition for review thereby violates the limitation of the issues to only legal questions, and, two, this Court, being a non-trier of facts, will not disturb the factual findings of the CA, unless they were mistaken, absurd, speculative, conflicting, tainted with grave abuse of discretion, or contrary to the findings reached by the court of origin," which was not the case here. (Naag, Jr., et al. vs. People, G.R. 228638, July 13, 2020)



This Court reiterates the basic procedural rule that it is not a trier of facts and that only pure questions of law may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45; although jurisprudence has provided several exceptions to this rule, such exceptions must be alleged, substantiated and proved

by the parties so that this Court may effectively evaluate and review the factual issues raised. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the appellate court; the Supreme Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court a quo. (Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corporation vs. Tan also known as Carmen S.F. Gatmaytan and/or Unknown Owner/Proprietor of Save More Drug doing business under the name and style of Save More Drug, G.R. 239989, July 13, 2020)



Under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, jurisdiction is generally limited to the review of errors of law committed by the appellate court; the Supreme Court is not obliged to review all over again the evidence which the parties adduced in the court a quo; the general rule though admits of exceptions, one of which is when the factual findings of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are conflicting or contradictory. (Spouses Viovicente vs. Spouses Viovicente, G.R. 219074, July 28, 2020)



Under Section 1, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, petitions for review on certiorari shall raise only questions of law; a question of fact exists when there is a doubt as to the truth of certain facts, and it can only be resolved through a reexamination of the body of evidence. (Eastern Overseas Employment Center, Inc., et al. vs. Heirs of the Deceased Nomer P. Odulio, represented by his wife, May Imbag Odulio,

G.R. 240950, July 29, 2020)



Ports of law, issues, theories and arguments 
- Giving due course to issues which were not ventilated before the trial court strips off the reviewing court of jurisdiction to decide a question not put forth as an issue; thus, any judgment rendered thereon is extrajudicial and invalid; except, when the factual bases thereof would not require presentation of any further evidence by the adverse party in order to enable it to properly meet the issue raised in the new theory. (Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corporation vs. Tan also known as Carmen S.F. Gatmaytan and/or Unknown Owner/Proprietor of Save More Drug doing business under the name and style of Save More Drug, G.R. 239989, July 13, 2020)



Settled is the rule that no questions will be entertained on appeal unless they have been raised below; points of law, theories, issues and arguments not adequately brought to the attention of the lower court need not be considered by the reviewing court as they cannot be raised for the first time on appeal; basic considerations of due process impel this rule; an exception exists when the consideration and resolution of the issue is "essential and indispensable in order to arrive at a just decision in the case." (Spouses Devisfruto vs. Greenfell, G.R. 227725, July 1, 2020)

The Court has consistently ruled that, in order to uphold the basic principles of fair play, justice and due process, issues and arguments not ventilated before the lower court do not merit the attention of the Court. (Villanueva, et al. vs. People, G.R. 237864, July 8, 2020)



The prohibition on shifting the theory of the case on appeal was explained by the Court in this manner: the settled rule is that defenses not pleaded in the answer may not be raised for the first time on appeal; a party cannot, on appeal, change fundamentally the nature of the issue in the case; when a party deliberately adopts a certain theory and the case is decided upon that theory in the court below, he will not be permitted to change the same on appeal, because to permit him to do so would be unfair to the adverse party; not only that such principle finds its legal footing on equity, but also on law. (Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corporation vs. Tan also known as Carmen S.F. Gatmaytan and/or Unknown Owner/Proprietor of Save More Drug doing business under the name and style of Save More Drug,

G.R. 239989, July 13, 2020)



Question of law 
- Question of law is raised when the petitioner is merely asking the court to determine whether the law was properly applied on the given facts and evidence without probing into or reviewing the evidence on record. (Villanueva, et al. vs. People, G.R. 237864, July 8, 2020)



#### ARREST



Warrantless arrest 
- An accused is estopped from assailing any irregularity of his arrest if he fails to raise this issue or to move for the quashal of the information against him on this ground before arraignment; thus, any objection involving a warrant of arrest or the procedure by which the court acquired jurisdiction of the person of the accused must be made before he enters his plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived. (People vs. AAA, G.R. 248777, July 7, 2020)



In Pestilos v. Generoso, we said that in connection with Section 5, paragraph (b), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, the arresting officer‘s exercise of discretion is limited by the standard of probable cause to be determined from the facts and circumstances within his personal knowledge and that the requirement of the existence of probable cause objectifies the reasonableness of the warrantless arrest for purposes of compliance with the Constitutional mandate against unreasonable arrests. (People vs. Yusop, G.R. 224587, July 28, 2020)



Jurisprudence tells us that the following must be present for a valid warrantless arrest under paragraph (b): i) an offense has just been committed; and ii) the arresting officer has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it. (People vs. Yusop, G.R. 224587, July 28, 2020)



#### ATTORNEYS



Attorney-client relationship 
- The general rule is that the negligence of counsel binds the client, even mistakes in the application of procedural rules; the exception to the rule is "when the reckless or gross negligence of the counsel deprives the client of due process of law." (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



The relationship between a lawyer and his client is highly fiduciary and prescribes on a lawyer a great fidelity and good faith; the highly fiduciary nature of this relationship imposes upon the lawyer the duty to account for the money or property collected or received for or from his client. (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020)



Attorney's fees 
- Canon 20 of the CPR requires that attorney's fees must be fair and reasonable; Rule 20.1 of the CPR enumerates criteria to be considered in assessing the proper amount of compensation that a lawyer should receive: Rule 20.01, a lawyer shall be guided by the following factors in determining his fees:
(a) The time spent and the extent of the services rendered or required; (b) The novelty and difficulty of the question involved; (c) The importance of the subject matter; (d) The skill demanded; (e) The probability of losing other employment as a result of acceptance of the proffered case; (f) The customary charges for similar services and the schedule of fees of the IBP Chapter to which he belongs; (g) The amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the client from the service; (h) The contingency or certainty of compensation; (i) The character of the employment, whether occasional or established; and (j) The professional standing of the lawyer. (Salazar vs. Duran, A.C. No. 7035, July 13, 2020)



Commingling of funds 
- Violation of the Code which mandates lawyers to keep the "funds of each client separate and apart from his own and those of others kept by him." (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020)



Disbarment 
- A case of suspension or disbarment may proceed regardless of complainant's interest or lack thereof; what matters is, whether on the basis of the facts borne out by the record, the charge had been proven; this rule is premised on the nature of disciplinary proceedings which is not a civil action where the complainant is a plaintiff and the respondent lawyer is a defendant. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



Although a disbarment proceeding may not be akin to a criminal prosecution, if the entire body of proof consists mainly of the documentary evidence, and the content of which will prove either the falsity or veracity of the charge for disbarment, then the documents themselves, as submitted into evidence, must comply with the Best Evidence Rule under Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, save for an established ground that would merit exception. (Basagan vs. Espina, A.C. No. 8395, July 8, 2020)

Being the most severe form of disciplinary sanction, disbarment is imposed only for the most imperative reasons and in clear cases of misconduct affecting the standing and moral character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and a member of the bar; lawyers must faithfully conduct themselves in a manner expected from members of the bar. (Perito vs. Baterina, et al., A.C. No. 12631, July 8, 2020)



Disbarment should be imposed in clear cases of misconduct that seriously affect the standing and character of the lawyer as an officer of the court and as member of the bar, or the misconduct borders on the criminal, or committed under scandalous circumstance; "the appropriate penalty on an errant lawyer depends on the exercise of sound judicial discretion based on the surrounding facts." (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020)



In disbarment proceedings, the burden of proof rests upon the complainant, and for the court to exercise its disciplinary powers, the case against the respondent must be established by clear, convincing and satisfactory proof; considering the serious consequence of the disbarment or suspension of a member of the Bar, this Court has consistently held that clear preponderant evidence is necessary to justify the imposition of the administrative penalty. (Suplico, et al. vs. Lokin, Jr., A.C. No. 9152 [Formerly CBC Case No. 05-1430], July 1, 2020)



The factual findings and recommendations of the CBD and the Board of Governors of the IBP are recommendatory; the Court is neither bound by its findings, much less, obliged to accept the same as a matter of course because as the tribunal which has the final say on the proper sanctions to be imposed on errant members of both the bench and bar, the Court has the prerogative of making its own findings and rendering judgment on the basis thereof rather than that of the IBP, OSG, or any lower court to whom an administrative complaint has been referred for investigation and report. (Basagan vs. Espina, A.C. No. 8395, July 8, 2020)



The issue in disciplinary proceedings against lawyers is their fitness to continue in the practice of law aimed at protecting the court and the public against reprehensible practices; the dismissal of the administrative case cannot depend on the unilateral decision of the complainant who is considered merely as a witness especially if the records could establish the liability of the erring lawyer. (Bukidnon Cooperative Bank, Represented by General Manager Wilhelmia P. Ferrer vs. Arnado, A.C. No. 12734, July 28, 2020)



The sole issue to be resolved therein is whether the lawyer concerned is morally fit to remain a member of the Philippine Bar. (Siao vs. Atup, A.C. No. 10890, July 1, 2020)

Duties 
- A lawyer owes entire devotion to the interest of his client, warmth and zeal in the maintenance and defense of his rights and the exertion of his utmost learning and ability, to the end that nothing can be taken or withheld from his client except in accordance with the law. (Perito vs. Baterina, et al., A.C. No. 12631, July 8, 2020)



Another important and fundamental tenet in legal ethics is that a lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his or her client but not at the expense of truth and the administration of justice; as officers of the court tasked with aiding this court in its dispensation of justice, lawyers take an oath that they will not wittingly or willingly promote any groundless, false or unlawful suit, nor give aid or consent to the same. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



As a member of the bar, he/she must maintain the integrity and dignity of the legal profession by refraining from committing acts which might diminish in any degree the confidence of the public in the fidelity, honesty and integrity of the profession; he/she is thus expected to preserve the trust and confidence reposed upon him/her by his/her clients, his/her profession, the courts and the public. (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020)



As a rule, a lawyer is not barred from dealing with his client but the business transaction must be characterized with utmost honesty and good faith; the measure of good faith which an attorney is required to exercise in his dealings with his client is a much higher standard that is required in business dealings where the parties trade at arm's length; business transactions between an attorney and his client are disfavored and discouraged by the policy of the law. (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020)



As an officer of the court, it is a lawyer‘s duty to uphold the dignity and authority of the court; the highest form of respect for judicial authority is shown by a lawyer‘s obedience to court orders and processes. (Basiyo, et al. vs. Alisuag, A.C. No. 11543, July 28, 2020)



Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandates the lawyer to promote respect for law and prohibits the lawyer from engaging in dishonest conduct. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



Canon 5 of the Code of Professional Responsibility requires that a lawyer be updated in the latest laws and jurisprudence; there is less than full compliance with the demands of professional competence, if a member of a bar does not keep himself abreast of the trend of authoritative pronouncements. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



In all his dealings with his client and with the courts, every lawyer is expected to be honest, imbued with integrity, and trustworthy; every lawyer is enjoined to obey the laws of the land, to refrain from doing any falsehood in or out of court or

from consenting to the doing of any in court, and to conduct himself according to the best of his knowledge and discretion with all good fidelity to the courts and to his clients. (Salazar vs. Duran, A.C. No. 7035, July 13, 2020)



Lawyers should set a good example in promoting obedience to the Constitution and the laws; this is because a lawyer who performs his duty with diligence and candor not only protects the interest of his client; he also serves the ends of justice, does honor to the bar, and helps maintain the respect of the community to the legal profession. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Zeal for a client's cause should not be at the expense of counsel's duty as an officer of the court. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



Influence peddling 
- Canon 7 of the CPR mandating that a "lawyer shall at all times uphold the integrity and dignity of the legal profession," as well as of Rule 15.06 proscribing a lawyer from stating or implying "that he is able to influence any public official, tribunal or legislative body." (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020



Knowingly misquoting or misrepresenting the text of a decision 
- Rule 10.02, Canon 10 of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandates that a lawyer shall not knowingly misquote or misrepresent the text of a decision or authority; it is the duty of all officers of the court to cite the rulings and decisions of the Supreme Court accurately; misquoting or intercalating phrases in the text of a court decision constitutes willful disregard of the lawyer's solemn duty to act at all times in a manner consistent with the truth. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Language used in professional dealings 
- By using intemperate language and strong allegations in a number of pleadings which he filed, it would be apt to remind the lawyer-parties of the import of the following provisions of the CPR: Canon 8 
- A lawyer shall conduct himself with courtesy, fairness and candor towards his professional colleagues, and shall avoid harassing tactics against opposing counsel; Rule 8.01 
- A lawyer shall not, in his professional dealings, use language which is abusive, offensive or otherwise improper. (Perito vs. Baterina, et al., A.C. No. 12631, July 8, 2020)



Liability of 
- A "deceitful" conduct means the proclivity for fraudulent and deceptive misrepresentation, artifice or device that is used upon another who is ignorant of the true facts, to the prejudice and damage of the party imposed upon. (Rivera vs. Dalangin, A.C. No. 12724, July 28, 2020)



A lawyer shall be administratively liable for withholding the true facts of the case with intent to mislead the court; penalty of reprimand imposed upon the respondent for breach of his duties as a lawyer under the lawyer‘s oath and Canon

10, Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. (Salazar vs. Duran, A.C. No. 7035, July 13, 2020)



A lawyer who holds a government office may not be disciplined as a member of the bar for misconduct in the discharge of his duties as a government official; if said misconduct as a government official also constitutes a violation of his oath as a lawyer, then he may be disciplined by this Court as a member of the Bar. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



A lawyer who willfully disobeys a court order requiring him to do something may not only be cited and punished for contempt but may also be disciplined as an officer of the court; any departure from the path which a lawyer must follow as demanded by the virtues of his profession shall not be tolerated by this Court as the disciplining authority. (Basiyo, et al. vs. Alisuag, A.C. No. 11543, July 28, 2020)



A lawyer's failure to return upon demand the funds held by him on behalf of his client, as in this case, gives rise to the presumption that he has appropriated the same for his own use in violation of the trust reposed in him by his client. (Ko vs. Maduramente, et al., A.C. No. 11118, July 14, 2020



An "unlawful" conduct refers to any act or omission that is contrary to, or prohibited or unauthorized by, or in defiance of, disobedient to, or disregards the law; it does not necessarily imply the element of criminality although the concept is broad enough to include such element. (Rivera vs. Dalangin, A.C. No. 12724, July 28, 2020)



By failing to examine documentary evidence, which turned out to be altered, respondent did not observe greater care to prevent the court from being misled; while prior knowledge of the alteration and that he willfully submitted the false evidence were not established, respondent‘s carelessness does not free him from liability. (Bukidnon Cooperative Bank, Represented by General Manager Wilhelmia P. Ferrer vs. Arnado, A.C. No. 12734, July 28, 2020)



It is well to point out that in the realm of legal ethics, a breach of the 2004 Notarial Rules would also constitute a violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility (CPR) particularly, Canon 1 and Rule 1.01 thereof considering that an erring lawyer who is found to be remiss in his functions as a notary public is considered to have violated his oath as a lawyer as well. (De Guzman vs. Venzon, et al., A.C. No. 8559, July 27, 2020)



Respondent exhibited dishonesty in feigning that he did not represent complainant in a civil case; respondent should have been circumspect in notarizing a document knowing that a compulsory heir was left out; taken together, respondent fell short of the standards expected of a lawyer in upholding the integrity and dignity of the legal profession. (Rivera vs. Dalangin, A.C. No. 12724, July 28, 2020)



To be "dishonest" means the disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, defraud or betray; be unworthy; lacking in integrity, honesty, probity, integrity in principle, fairness and straightforwardness. (Rivera vs. Dalangin, A.C. No. 12724, July 28, 2020)



Negligence 
- While as a general rule, negligence of the counsel binds the client, one of the exceptions is when the counsel's actuations are gross or palpable, resulting in serious injustice to client. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



Presumption of innocence 
- Lawyers enjoy the presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof rests upon the complainant to clearly prove his allegations by preponderant evidence. (Salazar vs. Duran, A.C. No. 7035, July 13, 2020)



#### BAIL



As a matter of discretion 
- It is basic that bail cannot be allowed without a prior hearing to a person charged with an offense punishable with reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment; as such, bail is a matter of discretion and its grant or denial hinges on the issue of whether the evidence of guilt against the accused is strong. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17-2503, July 28, 2020)



The Constitution guarantees the right to bail of all the accused except those charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua when the evidence of guilt is strong; however, in cases where the offense is punishable by reclusion perpetua and where the evidence of guilt is strong, bail is a matter of discretion. (In the Matter of the Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the Covid-19 Pandemic, Dionisio S. Almonte, represented by his wife Gloria P. Almonte, et al. vs. People, et al., G.R. 252117, July 28, 2020)



This Court outlined the duties of a judge in resolving bail applications, to wit:

1. in all cases, whether bail is a matter of right or of discretion, notify the prosecutor of the hearing of the application for bail or require him to submit his recommendation; 2. where bail is a matter of discretion, conduct a hearing of the application for bail regardless of whether or not the prosecution refuses to present evidence to show that the guilt of the accused is strong for the purpose of enabling the court to exercise its sound discretion; 3. decide whether the guilt of the accused is strong based on the summary of evidence of the prosecution; 4. if the guilt of the accused is not strong, discharge the accused upon the approval of the bail bond. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17- 2503, July 28, 2020)

Petition for 
- The court treats the instant petition as applications for bail or recognizance as well as motions for appropriate confinement arrangement in view of Covid 19 pandemic and refers the same to the respective trial courts where the cases are pending. (In the Matter of the Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the Covid-19 Pandemic, Dionisio S. Almonte, represented by his wife Gloria P. Almonte, et al. vs. People, et al., G.R. 252117, July 28, 2020)



Right to 
- Considering that petitioners were charged with offenses punishable by reclusion perpetua, they are not entitled to bail as a matter of right; evaluation of the evidence to determine petitioners‘ entitlement to bail involves factual questions, which the trial courts are competent to handle. (In the Matter of the Urgent Petition for the Release of Prisoners on Humanitarian Grounds in the Midst of the Covid-19 Pandemic, Dionisio S. Almonte, represented by his wife Gloria P. Almonte, et al. vs. People, et al., G.R. 252117, July 28, 2020)



The determination of the requisite evidence can only be reached after due hearing; a judge must first evaluate the prosecution's evidence; a hearing is likewise required for the trial court to consider the factors in fixing the amount of bail. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17-2503, July 28, 2020)



#### BANKS



Liquidation of a closed bank 
- If there is a judicial liquidation of an insolvent bank, all claims against the bank should be filed in the liquidation proceeding; this holds true regardless of whether or not the claim is initially disputed in a court or agency before it is filed with the liquidation court. (Fil-Agro Rural Bank, Inc., through the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC), as Liquidator vs. Villaseñor, Jr., G.R. 226761, July 28, 2020)



Jurisprudentially, it has long been resolved that ―disputed claims‖ covers all claims whether they be against the assets of the insolvent bank, for specific performance, breach of contract, damages or whatever; the term is defined in an all- encompassing and broad manner so as to include any cause of action against the insolvent bank, regardless of its nature or character, irrespective of whether the relief sought would directly affect the property of the bank under liquidation. (Fil-Agro Rural Bank, Inc., through the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC), as Liquidator vs. Villaseñor, Jr., G.R. 226761, July 28, 2020)



Section 30 of Republic Act No. 7653 (R.A. 7653) recognizes the exclusive jurisdiction of the liquidation court to adjudicate disputed claims against the closed bank, assist in the enforcement of individual liabilities of the stockholders, directors and officers, and decide on all other issues as may be material to implement the distribution plan adopted by the PDIC for general application to all closed banks. (Fil-

Agro Rural Bank, Inc., through the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC), as Liquidator vs. Villaseñor, Jr., G.R. 226761, July 28, 2020)



#### BILL OF RIGHTS



Right to inviolability of contracts 
- The constitutional right to inviolability of contracts is not absolute; it is subject to the proper exercise of the police power by the State; the contracts referred to by petitioners are labor contracts; under the Civil Code, labor contracts are impressed with public interest and must yield to the common good. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



Right to speedy disposition of cases 
- Corpuz v. Sandiganbayan objectifies the element of prejudice that an accused suffers: prejudice should be assessed in the light of the interest of the defendant that the speedy trial was designed to protect, namely: to prevent oppressive pre-trial incarceration; to minimize anxiety and concerns of the accused to trial; and to limit the possibility that his defense will be impaired; of these, the most serious is the last, because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. (People vs. The Honorable Fourth Division, Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 233061-62, July 28, 2020)



If the delay occurs beyond the given time period and the right is invoked, the burden of proof is shifted to the prosecution to prove that the delay is reasonable and justified; in Cagang, the Court held that once the burden of proof shifts to prosecution, the prosecution must prove the following: ―first, that it followed the prescribed procedure in the conduct of preliminary investigation and in the prosecution of the case; second, that the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence made the delay inevitable; and third, that no prejudice was suffered by the accused as a result of the delay.‖ (Catamco (formerly Nancy C. Perez) vs. Sandiganbayan Sixth Division, et al., G.R. Nos. 243560-62, July 28, 2020)



In dismissing criminal cases based on the right of the accused to speedy trial, courts carefully weigh the circumstances attending each case; they should balance the right of the accused and the right of the State to punish people who violate its penal laws; factors such as the length of delay, reason for the delay, the defendant's assertion or non-assertion of the right, and prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay, must be considered. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



On July 31, 2018, a definitive ruling on the concept of inordinate delay was laid down by the Court en banc in Cagang v. Sandiganbayan as follows: (1) The right to speedy disposition of cases is different from the right to speedy trial; (2) For purposes of determining inordinate delay, a case is deemed to have commenced from the filing of the formal complaint and the subsequent conduct of the preliminary investigation; (3) Courts must determine which party carries the

burden of proof; (4) Determination of the length of delay is never mechanical; (5) The right to speedy disposition of cases (or the right to speedy trial) must be timely raised. (People vs. The Honorable Fourth Division, Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 233061-62, July 28, 2020)



Section 16, Article III of the Constitution guarantees every person's right to a speedy disposition of his case before all judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative bodies; this constitutional right is not limited to the accused in criminal proceedings but extends to all parties in all cases, be it civil or administrative in nature, as well as in all proceedings, either judicial or quasi-judicial. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



The right to a speedy disposition of cases should be understood to be a relative or flexible concept such that a mere mathematical reckoning of the time involved would not be sufficient; case law teaches that the right is deemed violated only when the proceedings are attended by vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays; or when unjustified postponements of the trial are asked for or secured, or even without cause or justifiable motive, a long period of time is allowed to elapse without a party having his case tried. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



The right to speedy disposition of cases protects citizens from vexatious, capricious, and oppressive delays in the conduct of any case filed against them, whether the case be judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative; what constitutes "vexatious, capricious, and oppressive" delay is determined not by mere mathematical reckoning but in an ad hoc, case-to-case basis. (Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al. G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020)



The right to a speedy trial shall not be utilized to deprive the State of a reasonable opportunity of fairly indicting criminals; it secures rights to a defendant but, certainly, it does not preclude the rights of public justice; in the same manner, in Valencia v. Sandiganbayan, the Court emphasized that the right to speedy trial cannot be successfully invoked where to sustain it would result in a clear denial of due process to the prosecution. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



#### CANCELLATION OR CORRECTION OF ENTRIES IN THE CIVIL REGISTRY



Substantial correction 
- Failure to strictly comply with the procedural requirements renders the proceedings for the correction of substantial errors, void; impleading and notifying only the civil registrar and the publication of the petition are not sufficient compliance with the procedural requirements; instances when the subsequent publication of a notice of hearing may cure the failure to implead and notify the affected or interested parties. (Republic vs. Ontuca (Mother and

Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



The Civil Registrar and all persons who have or claim to have any interest that would be affected, must be impleaded in the petition for a substantial correction of an entry in the civil registry; the petition for the correction of petitioner's civil status in her daughter's birth certificate from "married" to "single," and the date and place of marriage to "no marriage," must implead all indispensable parties. (Republic vs. Ontuca (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



The correction of entries in the Civil Register pertaining to citizenship, legitimacy of paternity or filiation, or legitimacy of marriage involves substantial alterations which may be corrected, and the true facts established by filing a petition for cancellation and or correction of the entries before the regional trial court; the correction of the date and place of the parent‘s marriage to ―not married‖ must be filed before the regional trial court, as the same are substantial which will alter the child‘s status from legitimate to illegitimate. (Republic vs. Ontuca (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



The correction of the date and place of the parent's marriage from "May 25, 1999 at Occ. Mindoro" to "NOT MARRIED" is substantial since it will alter the child's status from legitimate to illegitimate; the correction of entries in the civil register pertaining to citizenship, legitimacy of paternity or filiation, or legitimacy of marriage involves substantial alterations, which may be corrected, and the true facts established, provide the parties aggrieved by the error to avail themselves of the appropriate adversary proceedings. (Republic vs. Ontuca (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



#### CERTIORARI


Petition for 
- A remedy directed not only to correct errors of jurisdiction, but also to set right, undo, and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the government; to qualify, mere abuse of discretion is not enough; it must be grave abuse of discretion as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty; a judge gravely abused her discretion when she acted in manifest disregard of what is contemplated and impelled by law, effectively evading her positive and solemn duty as a judge. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



In labor cases, grave abuse of discretion may be ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence, which refers

to that amount of relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion; if the NLRC's ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



In People v. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (First Division), it was declared that a special civil action for certiorari is the proper remedy against the Sandiganbayan's order of dismissal of a criminal complaint by reason of undue delay, thus: it must be noted at the outset that a judgment of acquittal may be assailed by the People in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court without placing the accused in double jeopardy. (People vs. The Honorable Fourth Division, Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 233061-62, July 28, 2020)



It is true that the proper remedy of a party aggrieved by a decision of the CA is to file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45, since it is a continuation of the appeal process; however, in this case, We are reviewing not the merits of the case but the jurisdiction of the MeTC in including in its disposition a property not subject of the complaint for unlawful detainer; to question the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction of the MeTC, the petitioners can file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 to question the Decision of the CA. (Cruz, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 238640, July 1, 2020)



Jurisprudence recognizes certain situations when the extraordinary remedy of certiorari may be deemed proper, such as: (a) when it is necessary to prevent irreparable damages and injury to a party; (b) where the trial judge capriciously and whimsically exercised his judgment; (c) where there may be danger of a failure of justice; (d) where an appeal would be slow, inadequate and insufficient;

(e) where the issue raised is one purely of law; (f) where public interest is involved; and (g) in case of urgency; moreover, the same remedy may be availed of even if the lost appeal was occasioned by a party's neglect or error in the choice of remedies when: (a) public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictates; (b) the broader interest of justice so requires; (c) the writs issued are null and void; or (d) the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Rule 65, Section 1 in relation to Rule 46, Section 3 requires that a petition for certiorari indicate three (3) material dates, namely: (1) when the notice of the judgment or final order was received; (2) when the motion for new trial or reconsideration, if any, was filed; and (3) when notice of the denial of the motion for new trial or reconsideration was received. (Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al, G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020)



To justify its availment of Rule 65, the Republic cited the trial court‘s violation of its right to due process amounting to grave abuse of discretion or excess of jurisdiction; in several cases, the Court sustained as proper remedy a petition for

certiorari where it was shown that the aggrieved party‘s right to due process was violated and the trial court was deemed to have been ousted of jurisdiction over the case. (Republic vs. Datuin, et al., G.R. 224076, July 28, 2020)



Petition for certiorari under Rule 64 
- As explained in Binga Hydroelectric Plant, Inc.
v. Commission on Audit: We have said previously that the belated filing of a petition for certiorari under Rule 64 is fatal; procedural rules should be treated with utmost respect and due regard since they are designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases to remedy the worsening problem of delay in the resolution of rival claims and in the administration of justice. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Certiorari petition filed under Rule 64 of the Rules of Court must be verified and accompanied by a certification against forum-shopping; attached to the Petition for Certiorari is a Manifestation by undersigned counsel of petitioner to the effect that the Verification and Certification against Forum-Shopping is a mere photocopy and undertakes to submit the original within three (3) days upon receipt. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Commission on Audit (COA) implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction or, the exercise of the power in an arbitrary manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility, which must be so patent or gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law; grave abuse of discretion, not committed by the COA when it denied the petition for review and sustained the notices of disallowances. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Not all errors of the Commission on Audit is reviewable by the Court, as the Court‘s review is confined solely to questions of jurisdiction whenever a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial function acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; factual findings of administrative bodies charged with their specific field of expertise, are afforded great weight by the courts, and in the absence of substantial showing that such findings were made from an erroneous estimation of the evidence presented, they are conclusive, and in the interest of stability of the governmental structure, should not be disturbed. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Section 3, Rule 64 of the Rules of Court provides that the petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed; the filing of a motion for new trial or reconsideration of said judgment or final order or resolution, if allowed under the procedural rules of the Commission concerned, shall interrupt this period; if the motion is denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the remaining period, but which shall

not be less than five (5) days in any event, reckoned from notice of denial. (Abpi

vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Writ of 
- Writ of Certiorari under Section 1 of Rule 65 will issue when there is grave abuse of discretion committed by a tribunal, board or officer who in the exercise of its judicial or quasi-judicial functions, has acted without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; in the instance of grave abuse of discretion, the court may annul or modify the proceedings of such tribunal, board or officer, and grant such incidental reliefs as the law and justice may require. (Bank of the Philippine Islands vs. Bacalla, Jr., et al., G.R. 223404, July 15, 2020)



#### CO-OWNERSHIP



Existence of 
- In case of cohabitation where one of the parties is incapacitated to marry, the ownership of the properties acquired by both of the parties through their actual joint contribution shall be owned by them in common in proportion to their respective contributions; no co-ownership and no presumption of equal shares absent proof of actual contribution of the party. (Dultra Vda. De Canada vs. Baclot, substituted by Sanchito Baclot, et al., G.R. 221874, July 7, 2020)



In case of cohabitation where one of the parties is validly married to another, the property registered under the name of one of the parties alone shall be declared her exclusive property, where there is no proof which would demonstrate that the other party contributed in the purchase thereof; while it is true that a certificate of title is not a conclusive proof of ownership as its issuance does not foreclose the possibility that such property may be co-owned by the persons not named therein, the claimant must nonetheless prove his/her title in the concept of an owner. (Dultra Vda. De Canada vs. Baclot, substituted by Sanchito Baclot, et al., G.R. 221874, July 7, 2020)



When a man and a woman, who are not incapacitated to marry each other, live together as husband wife, without marriage, or their marriage is void from the beginning, properties acquired by either or both of them during their cohabitation shall be governed by the rules on co-ownership; Article 144 of the Civil Code does not apply when the cohabitation amounts to adultery or concubinage. (Dultra Vda. De Canada vs. Baclot, substituted by Sanchito Baclot, et al., G.R. 221874, July 7, 2020)



#### CODE OF COMMERCE



Application of 
- Article 826. If a vessel should collide with another through the fault, negligence, or lack of skill of the captain, sailing mate, or any other member of the complement, the owner of the vessel at fault shall indemnify the losses and damages suffered, after an expert appraisal; Article 827. If both vessels may be blamed for the collision, each one shall be liable for his own damages, and both
shall be jointly responsible for the losses and damages suffered by their cargoes; to be cleared of liability under these provisions, a vessel must show that it exercised ordinary diligence. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



#### CODE OF CONDUCT FOR COURT PERSONNEL



Application of 
- This Court has long held that "the administration of justice is circumscribed with a heavy burden of responsibility which requires that everyone involved in its dispensation from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk live up to the strictest standards of competence, honesty, and integrity in the public service"; as the assumption of public office is impressed with paramount public interest, which requires the highest standards of ethics, persons aspiring for public office must observe honesty, candor and faithful compliance with the law. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Disbarment 
- Section 27, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court includes the "willful disobedience of any lawful order of a superior court" as one of the grounds for disbarment or suspension from the practice of law; lawyers are called upon to obey court orders and processes and respondents‘ deference is underscored by the fact that willful disregard thereof will subject the lawyer not only to punishment for contempt but to disciplinary sanctions as well. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Duties 
- Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility states that "a lawyer shall uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for law and legal processes"; by virtue of this Canon, lawyers should always keep in mind that, although upholding the Constitution and obeying the law is an obligation imposed on every citizen, a lawyer's responsibilities under Canon 1 mean more than just staying out of trouble with the law; as servants of the law and officers of the court, lawyers are required to be at the forefront of observing and maintaining the rule of law. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### COMMISSION ON AUDIT (COA)



Appeal from a notice of allowance 
- Constitutionality of COA resolution no. 2008-005 which authorizes the imposition and collection of filing fees on, among others, appeals from notices of suspension, disallowance or charge, upheld; the mandatory payment of filing fees is an allowable limitation to the right to appeal, and does not violate the parties‘ right to due process. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



If numerous notices of disallowance were issued against a government official, he or she may consolidate his or her appeals for these disallowances in one single

appeal, provided that the observance of the reglementary periods for each notice of disallowance allow it, and he or she has a similar argument or defense in all disallowances, subject to the payment of filing fees, which shall be assessed on the basis of aggregate amount of the disallowed transactions subject of the appeal. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



Only one filing fee shall be paid for every appeal, regardless of the number of petitioners, as filing fees are paid not to enrich the COA as a quasi-judicial tribunal, but to merely defray its expenses in the handling of cases, and avoid tremendous losses to the agency and to the government as well; notices of disallowances issued against many employees of one government agency can be paid by the agency in lump sum. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



The Auditees may appeal the notice of disallowance, subject to the payment of legal fees; the right to appeal is not a constitutional, natural or inherent right, but a statutory privilege of statutory origin and, therefore, available only if granted or provided by statute; as such, the law may validly provide limitations or qualifications to the exercise thereof. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



Grant of allowance 
- The burden of proving the validity or legality of the grant of allowance or benefits lies with the government agency or entity granting the allowance or benefit and the employee claiming the same; the non-participation of the employees who actually received the disallowed benefits does not prevent the court from determining the issue of whether the COA gravely abused its discretion in declaring the entity's issuance as illegal. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



Power 
- The Commission en banc has the power to promulgate its own rules concerning pleadings and practice before it or before any of its offices, provided such rules shall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



Rules of procedure 
- The essence of collegiality in the Commission on Audit is not lost even if only two members thereof have resolved to promulgate procedural rules, as it is not necessary that the entire complement of the Commission be present or sitting on the bench in order to constitute a commission sitting en banc. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)

The promulgated rules concerning pleadings and practice before the Commission on Audit or before any of its offices must be arrived at on the basis of collegial decisions and not by only one member of the commission proper. (The Department of Foreign Affairs, represented by Undersecretary Rafael E. Seguis, et al. vs. The Commission on Audit, G.R. 194530, July 7, 2020)



#### COMMON CARRIERS



Liability of 
- Common carriers, from the nature of their business and on public policy considerations, are bound to observe extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods transported by them; subject to certain exceptions enumerated under Article 1734 of the Civil Code, common carriers are responsible for the loss, destruction, or deterioration of the goods; the extraordinary responsibility of the common carrier lasts from the time the goods are unconditionally placed in the possession of, and received by the carrier for transportation until the same are delivered, actually or constructively, by the carrier to the consignee, or to the person who has a right to receive them. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



In cases where cargos are lost, destroyed, or deteriorated, an action based on the contract of carriage may be filed against the shipowner of the vessel based on Civil Code provisions on common carrier. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



In Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc., this Court held a shipowner liable because as a common carrier, the shipowner failed to observe extraordinary diligence in the transportation of goods required under Article 1734; it held that based on the bills of lading issued, the shipowner received the cargo in good condition, and their arrival in bad order at their destination constitutes a presumption that the carrier was negligent. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



In Regional Container Lines of Singapore v. The Netherlands Insurance Co. (Philippines), this Court summarized the rules on the liability of a common carrier: (1) Common carriers are bound to observe extraordinary diligence over the goods they transport, according to all the circumstances of each case; (2) In the event of loss, destruction, or deterioration of the insured goods, common carriers are responsible, unless they can prove that such loss, destruction, or deterioration was brought about by, among others, "flood, storm, earthquake, lightning, or other natural disaster or calamity"; and (3) In all other cases not specified under Article 1734 of the Civil Code, common carriers are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted negligently, unless they observed extraordinary diligence. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)

The high degree of diligence exacted by the law creates a presumption against common carriers when goods are lost, destroyed or deteriorated; to overcome this presumption, common carriers must prove that they exercised extraordinary diligence in the handling and transportation of the goods. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



#### COMPREHENSIVE AGRARIAN REFORM LAW (R.A. 6657)



Expropriation 
- As elucidated in Apo Fruits Corporation v. Landbank of the Phils.: We recognized in Republic v. Court of Appeals the need for prompt payment and the necessity of the payment of interest to compensate for any delay in the payment of compensation for property already taken; we ruled in this case that: If property is taken for public use before compensation is deposited with the court having jurisdiction over the case, the final compensation must include interest[s] on its just value to be computed from the time the property is taken to the time when compensation is actually paid or deposited with the court. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Leoncio Barrameda, G.R. 221216, July 13, 2020)



Just compensation carries the invariable definition of being the sum equivalent to the market value of the property, broadly described as the price fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal action and competition, or the fair value of the property as between the one who receives and the one who desires to sell, it being fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government; as a modifier to the word compensation, "just" means that the equivalent to be given for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full, and ample. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Leoncio Barrameda, G.R. 221216, July 13, 2020)



The delay in the payment of just compensation is a forbearance of money; thus, is entitled to earn interest; the difference in the amount between the initial payment made by the government and final amount of just compensation as adjudged by the court, should earn legal interest as a forbearance of money; the amount of just compensation due to the respondents for their expropriated property computed pursuant to A.O. No. 01-10, shall earn interest at the rate of 12 percent  per annum from July 1, 2009 until June 30, 2013, and, thereafter, at the rate of 6 percent  until November 19, 2013. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Leoncio Barrameda, G.R. 221216, July 13, 2020)



The rule is that the payment of just compensation must be reckoned from the time of taking or filing of the complaint, whichever came first; payment of just compensation should be reckoned from the date of taking when such preceded the filing of the complaint for expropriation; in exceptional circumstances, payment of just compensation may be reckoned from the time the property owners initiated inverse condemnation proceedings notwithstanding that the actual taking of the properties occurred earlier. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Leoncio Barrameda, G.R. 221216, July 13, 2020)



The unpaid landowners whose claims were covered under P.D. No. 27 and E.O. No. 228 and revalued under R.A. 6657 or R.A. 9700, are no longer allowed to avail of the 6 percent  incremental interest under A.O. No. 13-94 and its amendatory orders, as the updated values under A.O. No. 01-10, which took effect on July 1, 2009, answer for the inequity that the unpaid landowners suffered on account of the delay in the payment of just compensation. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Leoncio Barrameda, G.R. 221216, July 13, 2020)



When property owners are deprived of their lands without being properly compensated at the time of taking, interest on just compensation is due for the purpose of compensating the property owners for the income that they would have otherwise made. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Leoncio Barrameda, G.R. 221216, July 13, 2020)



#### COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002 (R.A. 9165)



Chain of custody 
- As a general rule, compliance with the chain of custody procedure is strictly enjoined as the same has been regarded "not merely as a procedural technicality but as a matter of substantive law"; this is because "the law has been crafted by Congress as safety precautions to address potential police abuses, especially considering that the penalty imposed may be life imprisonment‖; the Court has recognized that due to varying field conditions, strict compliance with the chain of custody procedure may not always be possible. (People vs. Suarez, G.R. 249990, July 8, 2020)



As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, inter alia, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same; in this regard, case law recognizes that "marking upon immediate confiscation contemplates even marking at the nearest police station or office of the apprehending team." (People vs. Suarez, G.R. 249990, July 8, 2020)



As part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same; the law also requires that the inventory and photography be done in the presence of the accused or his counsel, as well as the required witnesses: representatives from the media and the DOJ, and any elected public official. (People vs. Anicoy, XXX, defendant (minor- pleaded guilty), G.R. 240430, July 6, 2020)



Before a deviation from the mandatory procedural requirements under Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 may be allowed, the following requisites must be satisfied: (1) justifiable grounds must be shown to exist warranting a departure from the rule on strict compliance; and (2) the apprehending team must prove that the

integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items had been properly preserved. (People vs. Manansala, G.R. 228825, July 28, 2020)



Compliance with the chain of custody requirement provided by Section 21, therefore, ensures the integrity of confiscated, seized, and/or surrendered drugs and/or drug paraphernalia in four (4) respects: first, the nature of the substances or items seized; second, the quantity (e.g., weight) of the substances or items seized; third, the relation of the substances or items seized to the incident allegedly causing their seizure; and fourth, the relation of the substances or items seized to the person/s alleged to have been in possession of or peddling them. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



In arriving at this certainty, the very nature of prohibited drugs, they being susceptible to tampering and error, circumscribes the burden of the State in prosecuting the crime; to establish the requisite identity of the dangerous drug, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drug is seized up to its presentation in court as evidence. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



In illegal drugs cases, the drug itself constitutes the corpus delicti of the offense; the prosecution is, therefore, tasked to establish that the substance illegally possessed by the accused is the same substance presented in court; proof beyond reasonable doubt demands that unwavering exactitude be observed in establishing the corpus delicti; the chain of custody rule performs this function as it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence are removed. (People vs. Leaño, G.R. 246461, July 28, 2020)



In illegal drugs cases, there should be proof that the transaction or sale actually took place, coupled with the presentation in court of the corpus delicti as evidence; to establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime. (People vs. Anicoy, XXX, defendant (minor-pleaded guilty), G.R. 240430, July 6, 2020)



In People v. Asaytuno, Jr. citing People v. Tomawis, the Court has emphasized the importance of the required insulating witnesses at the time of seizure and confiscation, thus: The presence of the three witnesses must be secured not only during the inventory but more importantly at the time of the warrantless arrest. (People vs. Leaño, G.R. 246461, July 28, 2020)



In People v. Dela Cruz, the Court held that a single police officer's act of bodily keeping the seized drugs is viewed with distrust, fraught with dangers, reckless, if not dubious, and a doubtful and suspicious way of ensuring the integrity of the items. (People vs. Leaño, G.R. 246461, July 28, 2020)

In People v. Ubungen citing People v. Pajarin, the Court ruled that in case of stipulation by the parties to dispense with the attendance and testimony of the forensic chemist, it should be stipulated that the forensic chemist would have testified that he took the precautionary steps required in order to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item, thus: (1) the forensic chemist received the seized article as marked, properly sealed, and intact; (2) he resealed it after examination of the content; and (3) he placed his own marking on the same to ensure that it could not be tampered pending trial. (People vs. Leaño, G.R. 246461, July 28, 2020)



It is immaterial whether the allegation was for shabu or ephedrine, since both are dangerous drugs; the purpose of the laboratory examination is to confirm that the seized items are indeed dangerous drugs; the police officers cannot be expected to conclude with certainty whether the suspected dangerous drugs are shabu or ephedrine just by visual inspection. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



It is without question that the burden of (1) proving strict compliance with Section 21 of R.A. 9165; and (2) providing a sufficient explanation in case of any deviation from the said rule rests upon the prosecution, and such burden of proof never shifts. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



"Marking" means the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer places his/her initials and signature on the seized item; marking after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link; it is vital that the seized contraband be immediately marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will use the markings as reference. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



Non-compliance with the mandatory procedure under Section 21, Article II of

R.A. 9165 and its IRR does not in itself render the confiscated drugs inadmissible, as the desire for a perfect and unbroken chain of custody rarely occurs, but only triggers the operation of the saving clause enshrined in the IRR of R.A. 9165. (People vs. Manansala, G.R. 228825, July 28, 2020)



People v. Holgado directed the courts to exercise heightened scrutiny when minuscule amounts of narcotics are presented into evidence, and for good reason; behind this lies an inversely proportional relationship: the smaller the amount of narcotics is seized, the higher the probability of tampering and switching will be. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



People v. Omamos reiterated that for a successful prosecution of a case involving illegal drugs, the following four (4) links in the chain of custody must be proved: first, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the dangerous drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the dangerous drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the dangerous drug to the

forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked dangerous drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



People v. Sanchez then emphasized that "marking" pertains to "the placing by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials and signature on the item/s seized‖; placing identifying marks, such as the apprehending officer's initials and signature, on the seized dangerous drug serves to set apart as evidence the dangerous drugs from other similar items. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



R.A. 9165 restrictively enumerates the places where the inventory and photographing of the seized drug specimen can be done: (1) at the place of seizure; (2) at the nearest police station; or (3) at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 requires that: (1) the seized items be inventoried and photographed immediately after seizure or confiscation; and (2) the physical inventory and photographing must be done in the presence of (a) the accused or his/her representative or counsel, (b) an elected public official, (c) a representative from the media, and (d) a representative from the DOJ, all of whom shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy of the same. (People vs. Yusop, G.R. 224587, July 28, 2020)



Strict adherence with Section 21 of R.A. 9165 is the rule, as anything less than this would automatically be a deviation from the chain of custody rule that would only pass judicial muster in the most exacting of standards following the twin requirements of existence of justifiable reasons, and preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



The Court concedes that R.A. 9165 contains a saving clause allowing liberality whenever there are compelling reasons to otherwise warrant deviation from the established protocol so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



The Court emphasizes that without the insulating presence of the required witnesses during the seizure and marking of the dangerous drug, the evils of switching, "planting" or contamination of the evidence rear their ugly heads as to negate the integrity and credibility of such seizure and of the corpus delicti. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



The Court has held that the prosecution has the positive duty to demonstrate strict observance of the chain of custody rule and "as such, they must have

the initiative to not only acknowledge, but also justify any perceived deviations from the said procedure during the proceedings before the trial court"; any procedural lapses must be explained, and the justifiable ground for non- compliance must be proven as a fact by the prosecution. (People vs. Sioson, G.R. 242686, July 7, 2020)



The Court, in Aranas v. People, declared that: To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime; as part of the chain of custody procedure, the law requires, inter alia, that the marking, physical inventory, and photography of the seized items be conducted immediately after seizure and confiscation of the same. (People vs. Pis-An, G.R. 242692, July 13, 2020)



The first link speaks of seizure and marking which should be immediately done at the place of arrest and seizure; it includes the physical inventory and taking of photographs of the seized items in the presence of the accused and third-party witnesses. (People vs. Leaño, G.R. 246461, July 28, 2020)



The IRR of R.A. 9165 offers a saving clause allowing leniency whenever justifiable grounds exist which warrant deviation from established protocol so long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved. (People vs. Sanico a.k.a. ―Marlon Bob,‖ G.R. 240431, July 7, 2020)



The legality of entrapment operations involving illegal drugs begins and ends with Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165; it provides the chain of custody rule, outlining the procedure that police officers must follow in handling the seized drugs, in order to preserve their integrity and evidentiary value. (People vs. Manansala, G.R. 228825, July 28, 2020)



The prosecution is, therefore, tasked to establish that the substance illegally possessed by the accused is the same substance presented in court; it must prove that the dangerous drug seized from petitioner is truly the substance offered in court as corpus delicti with the same unshakeable accuracy as that required to sustain a finding of guilt. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



The prosecution must establish beyond reasonable doubt the identity of the dangerous drug to prove its case against the accused; the prosecution can only forestall any doubts on the identity of the dangerous drug seized from the accused to that which was presented before the trial court if it establishes an unbroken chain of custody over the seized item; the prosecution must be able to account for each link in the chain of custody over the dangerous drug, from the moment of seizure up to its presentation in court as evidence of the corpus delicti. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)

The prosecution must satisfactorily establish the movement and custody of the seized drug through the following links: (1) the confiscation and marking of the specimen seized from the accused by the apprehending officer; (2) the turnover of the seized item by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; (3) the investigating officer's turnover of the specimen to the forensic chemist for examination; and, (4) the submission of the item by the forensic chemist to the court. (People vs. Balbarez, G.R. 246999, July 28, 2020)



The seized narcotic is the corpus delicti in drug cases; the chain of custody must be preserved to establish with moral certainty that the drug presented as evidence in court be the same drug seized from an accused. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



The utter disregard of the required procedures created a huge gap in the chain of custody; we reiterate that the provisions of Section 21 of R.A. 9165 embody the constitutional aim to prevent the imprisonment of an innocent man; the Court cannot tolerate the lax approach of law enforcers in handling the very corpus delicti of the crime. (People vs. Balbarez, G.R. 246999, July 28, 2020)



Time and again, the Court has held that the practice of police operatives of not bringing to the intended place of arrest the three witnesses, when they could easily do so and "calling them in" to the place of inventory to witness the inventory and photographing of the drugs only after the buy-bust operation has already been finished does not achieve the purpose of the law in having these witnesses prevent or insulate against the planting of drugs. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



To ensure an unbroken chain of custody, Section 21 (1) of R.A. 9165 specifies: (1) The apprehending team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof. (People vs. Sanico a.k.a. ―Marlon Bob,‖ G.R. 240431, July 7, 2020)



.
- To ensure the integrity of the seized drug item, the prosecution must account for each link in its chain of custody: first, the seizure and marking of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized by the forensic chemist to the court. (People vs. Leaño, G.R. 246461, July 28, 2020)

To establish the identity of the dangerous drugs with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime. (People vs. Suarez, G.R. 249990, July 8, 2020)



To maintain the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized prohibited drug, the apprehending officers must ensure that the chain of custody in handling the same is not compromised; the procedure therefor is specifically outlined in Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165 and the corresponding provisions in its IRR. (People vs. Lacson, G.R. 229055, July 15, 2020)



Under Section 21 of R.A. 9165, as amended by R.A. 10640, aside from the accused or his/her representative or counsel, an elected public official, and a representative of the NPS or the media should be there to witness the physical inventory of the alleged seized items and photographing of the same. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



Chain of custody rule 
- The law puts in place requirements of time, witnesses, and proof of inventory with respect to the custody of seized dangerous drugs: 1. The initial custody requirements must be done immediately after seizure or confiscation; 2. The physical inventory and photographing must be done in the presence of: a. The accused or his representative or counsel; b. The required witnesses: i. a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official for offenses committed during the effectivity of R.A. 9165 and prior to its amendment by R.A. 10640; ii. an elected public official and a representative of the National Prosecution Service of the DOJ or the media for offenses committed during the effectivity of R.A. 10640. (People vs. Anicoy, XXX, defendant (minor-pleaded guilty), G.R. 240430, July 6, 2020)



Illegal possession of prohibited drugs 
- Elements are: "(a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug.‖ (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



For the charge of illegal possession of a dangerous drug to prosper, it must be proven that (1) the accused was in possession of an item or an object identified to be a prohibited or regulated drug, (2) such possession is not authorized by law, and (3) the accused was freely and consciously aware of being in possession of the drug. (People vs. Pis-An, G.R. 242692, July 13, 2020)



Illegal sale and possession of prohibited drugs 
- In cases for Illegal Sale and/or Illegal Possession of Dangerous Drugs under R.A. 9165, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime; failing to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti renders the evidence for

the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and hence, warrants an acquittal. (People vs. Suarez, G.R. 249990, July 8, 2020)



In order to ensure Sioson's conviction for the illegal sale of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must satisfactorily establish: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object and the consideration, and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment, for the charge of illegal sale of dangerous drugs; while the elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs are: (1) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (2) such possession was not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug, for the illegal possession charge. (People vs. Sioson, G.R. 242686, July 7, 2020)



In such cases of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs under R.A. 9165, it is essential that the prosecution successfully demonstrate, with moral certainty, the identity of the subject drugs, especially since the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime; failing to do so, renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused, hence, warrants an acquittal. (People vs. Sioson, G.R. 242686, July 7, 2020)



Illegal sale of prohibited drugs 
- Among the fundamental principles to which undivided fealty is given is that, in a criminal prosecution for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, as amended, the State is mandated to prove that the illegal transaction did in fact take place; and there is no stronger or better proof of this fact than the presentation in court of the actual and tangible seized drug itself mentioned in the inventory, and as attested to by the so-called insulating witnesses named in the law itself. (People vs. Abueva, G.R. 243633, July 15, 2020)



In illegal sale of dangerous drugs, it is necessary that the sale transaction actually happened and that "the procured object is properly presented as evidence in court and is shown to be the same drugs seized from the accused." (People vs. Sanico a.k.a. ―Marlon Bob,‖ G.R. 240431, July 7, 2020)



In illegal sale, the illicit drugs confiscated from the accused comprise the corpus delicti of the charges; it is of paramount importance that the identity of the dangerous drug be established beyond reasonable doubt; and that it must be proven with certitude that the substance bought during the buy-bust operation is exactly the same substance offered in evidence before the court. (People vs. Sanico a.k.a. ―Marlon Bob,‖ G.R. 240431, July 7, 2020)



In People v. Manlangit, citing Quinicot v. People, the Court pronounced: settled is the rule that the absence of a prior surveillance or test buy does not affect the legality of the buy-bust operation; there is no textbook method of conducting buy- bust operations; the Court has left to the discretion of police authorities the

selection of effective means to apprehend drug dealers; a prior surveillance, much less a lengthy one, is not necessary, especially where the police operatives are accompanied by their informant during the entrapment. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



In prosecuting this charge, the State bears the burden of proving the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer, as well as the seller, the object and consideration of the sale; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor; what is material is proof that the transaction or sale took place as a matter of fact, coupled with the presentation in court of the dangerous drug seized as evidence. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



The commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires the consummation of the illegal sale which is statutorily defined as "any act of giving away any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical whether for money or any other consideration"; in apprehensions pursuant to a buy-bust operation, delivery of the illegal drug to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money completes the illegal transaction. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



The elements of Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165 are: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and its payment; the delivery of the illicit drug to the poseur-buyer and the receipt by the seller of the marked money consummate the illegal transaction. (People vs. Anicoy, XXX, defendant (minor-pleaded guilty), G.R. 240430, July 6, 2020)



To be able to secure the conviction of an accused charged with Illegal Sale of Dangerous Drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the prosecution must prove with moral certainty: (a) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment. (People vs. Manansala, G.R. 228825, July 28, 2020)



To secure a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the prosecution must establish the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



Under Article II, Section 5 of R.A. 9165 or illegal sale of prohibited drugs, in order to be convicted of the said violation, the following must concur: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and

(2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Sanico

a.k.a. ―Marlon Bob,‖ G.R. 240431, July 7, 2020)

Illegal transportation of prohibited drugs 
- In illegal transportation of prohibited drugs, the essential element is the movement of the dangerous drug from one place to another; as explained by the Court in People v. Asislo: the essential element of the charge of illegal transportation of dangerous drugs is the movement of the dangerous drug from one place to another; as defined in the case of People v. Mariacos, "transport" means "to carry or convey from one place to another"; there is no definitive moment when an accused "transports" a prohibited drug. (People vs. Lacson, G.R. 229055, July 15, 2020)



Illegal use of prohibited drugs 
- While Section 15 penalizes a person apprehended or arrested for unlawful acts listed under Article II of R.A. 9165 and who is found to be positive for use of any dangerous drug, a conviction presupposes the prior conduct of an initial screening test and a subsequent confirmatory test both yielding positive results for illegal drug use; from Section 36 of R.A. 9165, two distinct drug tests are required: a screening test and a confirmatory test; a positive screening test must be confirmed for it to be valid in a court of law. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 247974, July 13, 2020)



#### CONSPIRACY



Existence of 
- Conspiracy is said to exist where two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it; it can be proven by evidence of a chain of circumstances and may be inferred from the acts of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime which indubitably point to and are indicative of a joint purpose, concert of action and community of interest. (People vs. Leocadio, et al., G.R. 237697, July 15, 2020)



#### CONTEMPT



Contempt of court 
- Section 3(b), Rule 71 of the same Rules makes "disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, or judgment of a court" one of the grounds from indirect contempt; since "contempt of court" has been defined as a willful disregard or disobedience of a public authority, even a defiance directed against a judgment of a superior court which has not yet attained finality and is pending for review before this Court is considered contemptuous. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### CONTRACTS



Absolute simulation 
- Under Article 1409 of the Civil Code, absolute simulation voids a contract; in absolute simulation, there appears a colorable contract but there actually is none, as the parties thereto have never intended to be bound by it; in determining the true nature of a contract, the primary test is the intention of the parties; such intention is determinable not only from the express terms of their
agreement, but also from the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the parties. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



Contracts of adhesion 
- An adhesion contract is a contract unilaterally prepared and drafted in advance by one party; in this kind of contract, "parties are not given a real arms' length opportunity to transact"; the weaker party has no option but to accept the terms and conditions already inserted in the contract; for this reason, the party may not have understood all the terms and stipulations prescribed. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



Plain meaning rule 
- The intent of the parties to an instrument is embodied in the writing itself, and when the words are clear and unambiguous, the intent is to be discovered only from the express language of the agreement; the execution of the real estate mortgages and registration of the same with the registry of deed are within the scope of the authority granted under the special power of attorney. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



Stipulation on 
- Whatever stipulations agreed upon in them must be complied with in good faith; however, the freedom to stipulate is not absolute; under Article 1306 of the Civil Code, parties cannot agree on stipulations that are "contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy." (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



When parties enter into contracts, they are free to stipulate on the terms and conditions of their agreement as they may deem convenient; contracts have the force of law between the contracting parties. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



Void contracts 
- Article 1410 of the Civil Code ordains; The action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe; in Santos v. Heirs of Lustre, the complaint alleged that the deed of sale was simulated; there, the Court ruled that the action for reconveyance on the ground that the certificate of title was obtained by means of a fictitious deed of sale is virtually an action for the declaration of its nullity, which does not prescribe. (Spouses Viovicente vs. Spouses Viovicente, et al., G.R. 219074, July 28, 2020)



In Heirs of Arao v. Heirs of Eclipse, the Court held that title cannot be used to validate the forgery or cure a void sale; the registered owner does not thereby lose his title, and neither does the assignee in the forged deed acquire any right or title to the property. (Spouses Viovicente vs. Spouses Viovicente, et al., G.R. 219074, July 28, 2020)



Voidable contracts 
- Vitiation of consent by means of fraud is a ground for the annulment of a voidable contract, and not for the nullification of a void contract. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



#### CORPORATION CODE



Section 74 
- A violation of these duties invites criminal prosecution against the erring officers to allow the eventual application of the prescribed penalties; jurisprudence cites the elements of the subject offense as follows: first, director, trustee, stockholder or member has made a prior demand in writing for a copy of excerpts from the corporation's records or minutes; second, any officer or agent of the concerned corporation shall refuse to allow the said director, trustee, stockholder or member of the corporation to examine and copy said excerpts; third, if such refusal is made pursuant to a resolution or order of the board of directors or trustees, the liability under this section for such action shall be imposed upon the directors or trustees who voted for such refusal; and, fourth, where the officer or agent of the corporation sets up the defense that the person demanding to examine and copy excerpts from the corporation's records and minutes has improperly used any information secured through any prior examination of the records or minutes of such corporation or of any other corporation, or was not acting in good faith or for a legitimate purpose in making his demand, the contrary must be shown or proved. (Keh, et al. vs. People, G.R. Nos. 217592-93, July 13, 2020)



The underlying prosecution is for the alleged violation of Section 74 of the Corporation Code, in relation to Section 144 thereof; these provisions create the duty on the part of the corporation to keep and preserve a record of all business transactions and minutes of all meetings of stockholders, members, or the board of directors or trustees, along with the duty to make such record available to its stockholders or members upon written request therefore. (Keh, et al. vs. People, G.R. Nos. 217592-93, July 13, 2020)



#### CORPORATIONS



Directors and officers 
- In case of dismissals, directors and officers of corporations may only be held solidarily liable with the corporation if they acted in bad faith or with malice. (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



Doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate fiction 
- The doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate entity can only be raised during a full-blown trial over a cause of action duly commenced involving parties duly brought under the authority of the court by way of service of summons or what passes as such service. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



The doctrine will only come into play once the court has already acquired jurisdiction over the corporation; only then would it be allowed to present evidence for or against piercing the veil of corporate fiction. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



The general doctrine of separate juridical personality provides that a corporation has a legal personality separate and distinct from that of its stockholders and other corporations to which it may be connected; it is a well-established rule in labor proceedings that the Labor Arbiter, or this Court for that matter, cannot acquire jurisdiction over the person of the respondent until he/she is validly served with summons, or that he/she voluntarily appears in court. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



Liability of 
- It is settled that a corporation has a personality distinct and separate from the persons composing it; as a general rule, only the employer-corporation, and not its officers, may be held liable for illegal dismissal of employees; the exception applies when corporate officers acted with bad faith. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



#### CORRECTION OF CLERICAL OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN THE CIVIL REGISTRY (R.A. 9048, AS AMENDED BY R.A. 10172)



Application of 
- In 2001, R.A. 9048 was enacted, amending Rule 108; under the law, the local civil registrars, or the Consul General, as the case may be, are now authorized to correct clerical or typographical errors in the civil registry, or make changes in the first name or nickname, without need of a judicial order; this law provided an administrative recourse for the correction of clerical or typographical errors, essentially leaving substantial corrections to Rule 108; in 2012, R.A. 10172, amended R.A. 9048, expanding the authority of local civil registrars and the Consul General to make changes in the day and month in the date of birth, as well as in the recorded sex of a person, when it is patently clear that there was a typographical error or mistake in the entry. (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



R.A. 9048, as amended, did not divest the trial courts of jurisdiction over petitions for correction of clerical or typographical errors in a birth certificate, as the local civil registrars' administrative authority to change or correct similar errors is only primary but not exclusive. (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



The application of R.A. 9048, as amended, is not limited to cases in which the erroneous entries in the birth certificate sought to be corrected pertain to the owner of the birth certificate; Rule 3 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of R.A. 9048, as amended, provides: Rule 3. Who may file the petition - Any person of legal age, having direct and personal interest in the correction of a clerical or typographical error in an entry and/or change of first name or nickname in the civil register, may file the petition; a person is considered to have direct and personal interest when he is the owner of the record, or the owner's spouse,

children, parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, guardian, or any other person duly authorized by law or by the owner of the document sought to be corrected: provided, however, that when a person is a minor or physically or mentally incapacitated, the petition may be filed on his behalf by his spouse, or any of his children, parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, guardians, or persons duly authorized by law. (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



The court allows the filing of a single petition under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court for the corrections of both clerical or typographical and substantial erroneous entries in the civil records, rather than two separate petitions before the Regional Trial Court and the Local Civil Registrar, in order to avoid multiplicity of suits and further litigation between the parties, which is offensive to the orderly administration of justice. (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



Clerical or typographical error 
- In Republic v. Mercadera, we ruled that the correction of petitioner's misspelled first name from "MARILYN" to "MERLYN" involves a mere clerical error; in Yu v. Republic it was held that ―to change

‗Sincio‘ to ‗Sencio‘ which merely involves the substitution of the first vowel ‗i‘ in the first name into the vowel ‗e‘ amounts merely to the righting of a clerical error.‖ (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



Section 2(3) of R.A. 9048, as amended, defines a clerical or typographical error as a mistake committed in the performance of clerical work in writing, copying, transcribing or typing an entry in the civil register that is harmless and innocuous, such as misspelled name or misspelled place of birth, mistake in the entry of day and month in the date of birth or the sex of the person or the like, which is visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding, and can be corrected or changed only by reference to other existing record or records. (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



Substantial correction 
- The term "substantial" means consisting of or relating to substance, or something that is important or essential; in relation to change or correction of an entry in the birth certificate, substantial refers to that which establishes, or affects the substantive right of the person on whose behalf the change or correction is being sought; changes which may affect the civil status from legitimate to illegitimate, as well as sex, civil status, or citizenship of a person, are substantial in character. (Republic vs. Ontuca y Peleño (Mother and Guardian of her Minor Child, Zsanine Kimberly Jariol y Ontuca), G.R. 232053, July 15, 2020)



#### COURT OF APPEALS (CA)



Jurisdiction 
- In Spouses Marcelo v. LBC Bank, this Court held that the Court of Appeals has the authority to consider new evidence and perform what is necessary to resolve factual issues; the Court of Appeals may consider the new evidence presented by a party in a petition for certiorari. (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, as amended by Republic Act No. 7902, states: SECTION 9. Jurisdiction. - The Court of Appeals shall exercise: The Court of Appeals shall have the power to try cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence and perform any and all acts necessary to resolve factual issues raised in cases falling within its original and appellate jurisdiction, including the power to grant and conduct new trials or further proceedings. (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



#### COURT OF TAX APPEALS (CTA)



Denial of protest 
- Section 7(a)(2) of R.A. 9282 provides that the ―inaction‖ of the CIR or his failure to decide a disputed assessment within the 180-day period is
―deemed a denial‖ of the protest; Section 3(a)(2), Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of the CTA further clarifies that ―that in case of disputed assessments, the inaction of the CIR within the 180-period under Section 228 of the 1997 NIRC shall be deemed a denial for purposes of allowing the taxpayer to appeal his case to the CTA.‖ (Kepco Philippines Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. Nos. 225750-51, July 28, 2020)



Jurisdiction 
- The CTA has appellate jurisdiction over local tax cases decided by the RTC in the exercise of the latter's original jurisdiction as provided under Sec. 7, paragraph (a) (3) of R.A. 1125, as amended by R.A. 9282. (The City of Makati vs. The Municipality of Bakun, et al., G.R. 225226, July 7, 2020)



#### COURT OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES



Absenteeism and tardiness 
- The Supreme Court has consistently emphasized in Administrative Circular No. 1-99 the need for Court officials and employees to
―strictly observe official time; as punctuality is a virtue, absenteeism and tardiness are impermissible‖; in Administrative Circular No. 2-99, We stressed that

―Absenteeism and tardiness, even if such do not qualify as ‗habitual‘ or ‗frequent‘ under the CSC Memorandum Circular No. 4, Series of 1991, shall be dealt with severely. (Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness and Undertime in the First Semester of 2017, A.M. No. 2017-11-SC, July 27, 2020)



Dishonesty 
- Dishonesty is defined as the ―disposition to lie, cheat, deceive, or defraud; untrustworthiness, lack of integrity‖; it involves intentionally making a false statement to deceive or commit a fraud. (Re: Allegation of Falsification Against Process ServerS Maximo D. Legaspi and Desiderio S. Tesiorna, Branch 43 and
Office of The Clerk of Court, Respectively, Both of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, A.M. No. 11-7-76-MeTC, July 14, 2020)



Duties 
- The Constitution provides that public office is a public trust; public officials and employees must see to it that they follow the Civil Service Law and Rules; inherent in this mandate is the observance of prescribed office hours and the efficient use of every moment thereof for public service, if only to recompense the Government, and ultimately, the people, who shoulder the cost of maintaining the Judiciary. (Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness and Undertime in the First Semester of 2017, A.M. No. 2017-11-SC, July 27, 2020)


Falsification of official documents 
- Falsification of an official document, as an administrative offense, is knowingly making false statements in official or public documents. (Re: Allegation of Falsification Against Process ServerS Maximo D. Legaspi and Desiderio S. Tesiorna, Branch 43 and Office of The Clerk of Court, Respectively, Both of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, A.M. No. 11-7- 76-MeTC, July 14, 2020)


Under Rule IV, Section 52 (A) (1) of the Uniform Rules in Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, dishonesty and falsification of official document are both grave offenses punishable by dismissal from government service, without prejudice to criminal or civil liability; the penalty also carries with it the cancellation of respondent‘s eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, and perpetual disqualification for reemployment in the government service, unless otherwise provided in the decision. (Re: Allegation of Falsification Against Process ServerS Maximo D. Legaspi and Desiderio S. Tesiorna, Branch 43 and Office of The Clerk of Court, Respectively, Both of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, A.M. No. 11-7-76-MeTC, July 14, 2020)



Liability of 
- In Villordon v. Avila, the Court stressed that employment in the judiciary demands the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency from its personnel; all judiciary employees are expected to conduct themselves with propriety and decorum at all times; an act that falls short of the exacting standards set for public officers, especially those in the judiciary, shall not be countenanced. (Re: Allegation of Falsification Against Process ServerS Maximo

D. Legaspi and Desiderio S. Tesiorna, Branch 43 and Office of The Clerk of Court, Respectively, Both of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City, A.M. No. 11-7-76-MeTC, July 14, 2020)



To sustain a finding of administrative culpability, only substantial evidence is required, not overwhelming or preponderant, and very much less than proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal cases; substantial evidence is that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion. (Re: Allegation of Falsification Against Process ServerS Maximo D. Legaspi and Desiderio S. Tesiorna, Branch 43 and Office of The

Clerk of Court, Respectively, Both of the Metropolitan Trial Court, Quezon City,

A.M. No. 11-7-76-MeTC, July 14, 2020)



#### COURTS



Consolidation of cases 
- The propriety of consolidation of cases is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the court taking into account its purpose or object, to wit: (1) avoid multiplicity of suits; (2) guard against oppression or abuse; (3) prevent delay; (4) clear congested dockets; (5) simplify the work of the trial court; and (5) save unnecessary costs and expense. (Fil-Agro Rural Bank, Inc., through the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC), as Liquidator vs. Villaseñor, Jr., G.R. 226761, July 28, 2020)



Court notices 
- It bears stressing that ―in the absence of a proper and adequate notice to the court of a change of address, the service of the order or resolution of a court upon the parties must be made at the last address of their counsel of record.‖ (Henson vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 230185, July 7, 2020)



Hierarchy of courts 
- In a rare instance, the Constitution itself mandates the exercise of judicial power over a case even with the existence of factual issues; such sole exception is stated in Section 18, Article VII of the Constitution, that is, when the matter involved is the review of sufficiency of factual basis of the President's proclamation of martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus; although several exceptions were carved out from the general rule of the observance of hierarchy of courts, the nature of the question raised by the parties shall be one of law. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al.,

G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



In the case of Gios-Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications, the Court expounded on this constitutional imperative by emphasizing the structure of our judicial system; the trial courts decide on questions of fact and law in the first instance; the intermediate courts resolve both questions of fact and law; and the Court generally decides only questions of law; as a constitutional mechanism, the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is established to enable the Court to concentrate on its constitutional tasks, guided by the judicial compass in disposing of matters without need for factual determination. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



#### CRIMINAL PROCEDURE



Arraignment 
- In Samson v. Judge Daway, the Court explained that while the pendency of a petition for review is a ground for suspension of the arraignment, the aforecited provision limits the deferment of the arraignment to a period of 60 days reckoned from the filing of the petition with the reviewing office; it follows,

therefore, that after the expiration of said period, the trial court is bound to arraign the accused or to deny the motion to defer arraignment. (People vs. Goyala, Jr., G.R. 224650, July 15, 2020)



The 60-day limitation in the suspension of arraignment is a procedural rule that can be relaxed, where a party provides justifiable reasons to further suspend the criminal proceedings; the Speedy Trial Act of 1998 which imposes time limits from arraignment to promulgation of judgment to ensure the constitutional rights of the accused against vexatious prosecution, cannot be used to further extend a period fixed by law. (People vs. Goyala, Jr., G.R. 224650, July 15, 2020)



Upon the lapse of the 60-day period, the court is bound to arraign the accused or deny the Motion to Defer Arraignment whether or not the petition before the DOJ has been resolved; as explained in Crespo v. Judge Mogul (Crespo), when an Information has been filed in court, the prosecutor would be stripped of the power to dismiss the case, motu proprio; instead, the court acquires the exclusive jurisdiction to decide what to do with the case even if it is against the position of the public prosecutor or even the Secretary of Justice; the 60-day period was enacted in recognition of the power of the Secretary of Justice to review resolutions of his subordinates in criminal cases and such power was never revoked by Crespo. (People vs. Goyala, Jr., G.R. 224650, July 15, 2020)



Double jeopardy 
- Legal jeopardy attaches only: (1) upon a valid indictment; (2) before a competent court; (3) after arraignment; (4) when a valid plea has been entered; and (5) when the defendant was acquitted or convicted, or the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the accused. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



Section 7, Rule 117 of the 1985 and 2000 Rules on Criminal Procedure strictly adhere to the constitutional proscription against double jeopardy and provide for the requisites in order for double jeopardy to attach; for double jeopardy to attach, the following elements must concur: (1) a valid information sufficient in form and substance to sustain a conviction of the crime charged; (2) a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the accused has been arraigned and had pleaded; and (4) the accused was convicted or acquitted or the case was dismissed without his express consent. (ABC vs. People, G.R. 241591, July 8, 2020)



The Court has consistently held in an unbroken line of cases that dismissal of cases on the ground of failure to prosecute is equivalent to an acquittal that would bar further prosecution of the accused for the same offense. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



The three requisites of double jeopardy are: (1) a first jeopardy must have attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy must have been validly terminated; and (3) a second jeopardy must be for the same offense as that in the first. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



Information 
- A minor variance between the Information and the evidence does not alter the nature of the offense, nor does it determine or qualify the crime or penalty, so that even if a discrepancy exists, this cannot be pleaded as a ground for acquittal; his right to be informed of the charges against him has not been violated because where an accused is charged with a specific crime, he is duly informed not only of such specific crime but also of lesser crimes or offenses included therein. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



A supposed insufficiency in the allegation of the qualifying circumstance of treachery in the information is deemed waived by failure of the accused to file either a motion to quash the information or a motion for a bill of particulars before his arraignment. (People vs. Silvederio III, G.R. 239777, July 8, 2020)



It is, indeed, fundamental that for purposes of a valid indictment, every element of which the offense is composed must be alleged in the information; be that as it may, the criminal information is not meant to contain a detailed resumé of the elements of the charge in verbatim. (Keh, et al. vs. People, G.R. Nos. 217592-93, July 13, 2020)



Rule 110, Section 11 of the Rules of Court requires that the time of the commission of the offense must be alleged as near to the actual date as the information will permit; otherwise, the right of the accused to be informed would be violated; the accused must raise the issue of defective information in a motion to quash or bill of particulars, which may only be filed before arraignment. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Section 6, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court only requires, among others, that it must state the acts or omissions so complained of as constitutive of the offense; the fundamental test in determining the sufficiency of the material averments in an information is whether or not the facts alleged therein, which are hypothetically admitted, would establish the essential elements of the crime defined by law. (Keh, et al. vs. People, G.R. Nos. 217592-93, July 13, 2020)



Sections 4 and 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, can be applied by analogy in convicting the appellant of the offenses charged, which are included in the crimes proved; under these provisions, an offense charged is necessarily included in the offense proved when the essential ingredients of the former constitute or form part of those constituting the latter. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



The sufficiency of the allegations in the information serves the fundamental right of the accused to be informed of the nature of the charge and to enable him to suitably and adequately prepare his defense, as he is presumed to have no

independent knowledge of the facts that constitute the offense. (Keh, et al. vs. People, G.R. Nos. 217592-93, July 13, 2020)



Motion to quash 
- Certiorari is ordinarily not a viable remedy for the denial of a motion to quash a criminal information. (Keh, et al. vs. People, G.R. Nos. 217592-93, July 13, 2020)



Preliminary investigation 
- In Dichaves vs. Office of the Ombudsman: a person's rights in a preliminary investigation are subject to the limitations of procedural law; these rights are statutory, not constitutional; the purpose of a preliminary investigation is merely to present such evidence "as may engender a well- grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the respondent in a criminal complaint is probably guilty thereof." (People vs. Goyala, Jr., G.R. 224650, July 15, 2020)



Section 3(f), Rule 112 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure provides that the investigating prosecutor has ten (10) days ―after the investigation to determine whether or not there is sufficient ground to hold the respondent for trial.‖ (Catamco (formerly Nancy C. Perez) vs. Sandiganbayan Sixth Division, et al., G.R. Nos. 243560-62, July 28, 2020)



Section 4 of the same rule states that ―within five (5) days from his resolution, the investigating prosecutor shall forward the record of the case to the Ombudsman or his deputy who shall act on the resolution within ten (10) days from their receipt thereof and shall immediately inform the parties of such action‖; ―the investigating officer of the Ombudsman, has ten (10) days from the termination of the investigation or the submission of the case for resolution, to determine existence of probable cause to indict an accused.‖ (Catamco (formerly Nancy C. Perez) vs. Sandiganbayan Sixth Division, et al., G.R. Nos. 243560-62, July 28, 2020)



Probable cause 
- Probable cause is understood in two (2) senses: (1) the executive; and
(2) the judicial; the executive determination of probable cause is done during preliminary investigation where the prosecutor ascertains whether "there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, and should be held for trial." (Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al. G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020)



The executive determination of probable cause is within the exclusive domain of the prosecutor and, absent grave abuse of discretion, this determination cannot be interfered with by the courts; on the other hand, the judicial determination of probable cause is done by a judge to determine whether a warrant of arrest should issue. (Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al. G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020)

The finding of probable cause need only to rest on evidence showing that more likely than not a crime has been committed and there is enough reason to believe that it was committed by the accused. (Sombero, Jr. vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. Nos. 237888 & 237904, July 28, 2020)



Prosecution of offenses 
- Proper offense to be charged against the offender is within the discretion of the Office of the Ombudsman; there is nothing inherently irregular or contrary to law in filing against an accused an indictment for an offense different from what is charged in the initiatory complaint, if warranted by evidence developed during the preliminary investigation; right to due process of the accused. (Sombero, Jr. vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. Nos. 237888 & 237904, July 28, 2020)



Remedy in case of dismissal or acquittal of a criminal case 
- If a criminal case is dismissed by the trial court or if there is an acquittal, a reconsideration thereof may be undertaken, whenever legally feasible, insofar as the criminal aspect thereof is concerned; the remedy of reconsideration may be made only by the public prosecutor, or in the case of an acquittal, by the State, through the OSG; the offended party or private complainant may file a motion for reconsideration of such dismissal or acquittal, or appeal therefrom insofar as the civil aspect thereof is concerned; if the court denies the motion for reconsideration, the private complainant or offended party may appeal or file the petition for certiorari or mandamus, if grave abuse amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction is shown and the aggrieved party has no right of appeal or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



#### DAMAGES



Actual damages 
- Actual damages are compensation for an injury that will put the injured party in the position where he/she was before the injury; they pertain to such injuries or losses that are actually sustained and susceptible of measurement. (Navarro-Banaria, vs. Banaria, et al., G.R. 217806, July 28, 2020)



Attorney's fees 
- Considering that the respondent was forced to litigate to protect his right and interest, he is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney's fees pursuant to Article 2208(8) of the Civil Code; the Court finds that payment of attorney's fees is warranted in an amount equivalent to 10 percent  of the total amount to be recovered by the respondent. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



"J" Marketing Corporation v. Sia, Jr. has ruled that ―no attorney‘s fees and litigation expenses can automatically be recovered even if a party wins, as it is not the fact of winning alone that entitles recovery of such items, but rather the attendance of special circumstances, the enumerated exceptions in Article 2208 of the New Civil Code.‖ (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)

Civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages 
- In the case of People v. Jugueta, the increase in the amounts of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages has been explained in detail; as it now stands, in cases of simple or qualified rape, among others, where the imposable penalty is death but the same is reduced to reclusion perpetua because of R.A. 9346, the amounts of civil indemnity, moral damages and exemplary damages are pegged uniformly at P100,000.00. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



Exemplary damages 
- Exemplary damages, are recoverable when the dismissal was done in a wanton, oppressive, or malevolent manner. (MagtibaY vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al.,

G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



Moral damages 
- A robotic allegation that one suffered anxiety and sleepless nights, or a seemingly haphazard conversion of these disturbed feelings into some pecuniary equivalent, without more, will not automatically entitle a party to moral damages. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



Moral damages are recoverable when the dismissal of an employee is attended by bad faith or fraud or constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy. (MagtibaY vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al.,

G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



#### DECLARATORY RELIEF



Petition for 
- Although a petition for declaratory relief was improper when assailing government issuances, yet when the issues have "far-reaching implications and raises questions that need to be resolved for the public good; or if the assailed act or acts of executive officials are alleged to have usurped legislative authority," then a petition for declaratory relief may be treated as a petition for prohibition. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Federation of Golf Clubs of the Philippines, Inc., G.R. 226449, July 28, 2020)



#### DENIAL AND FRAME-UP



Defenses of 
- These are "self-serving negative evidence which cannot be accorded greater evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative matters." (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)



#### DUE PROCESS



Administrative due process 
- Stringent technical rules of procedure and evidence is not required in administrative proceedings; the fundamental notion that one's tenure in government springs exclusively from the trust reposed by the public means that continuance in office is contingent upon the extent to which one is able to
maintain that trust. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



The essence of due process, as the Court has consistently ruled, is simply the opportunity to be heard, or to explain one‘s side, or to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of; thus, for as long as the party was afforded the opportunity to defend himself/herself, there is due process. (Henson vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 230185, July 7, 2020)



The essence of due process is simply to be heard, or as applied to administrative proceedings, a fair and reasonable opportunity to explain one's side, or an opportunity to seek a reconsideration of the action or ruling complained of; respondent cannot be allowed to change tack after obtaining an unfavorable decision, where he was fully and properly notified of the charges and the evidence, given ample opportunity to contradict the accusations against him, vigorously participated throughout the administrative proceedings, and submitted to the jurisdiction of the disciplining authority. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



Principle of 
- A critical component of due process is a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal; all the other elements of due process, like notice and hearing, would be meaningless if the ultimate decision would come from a partial and biased judge; such constitutional principle is the basis of Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



SSK Parts Corporation v. Camas held that active participation in the proceedings a quo are all part and parcel of right to due process; as appellant had all the opportunities to be heard, he may not complain that he was denied due process. (People vs. Bacaltos, G.R. 248701, July 28, 2020)



The Constitution itself identifies the limitations to the awesome and near-limitless powers of the State; chief among these limitations are the principles that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



Procedural due process 
- As for the notice requirements, it is settled that for the manner of dismissal in termination proceedings to be valid, the employer must comply with the employee's right to procedural due process by furnishing him with two written notices before the termination of his employment; the first notice apprises the employee of the specific acts or omissions for which his or her dismissal is sought, while the second informs the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him or her. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs.
National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al., G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



Substantive and procedural aspects of due process 
- Before the employer may terminate the services of the employee he must comply with the substantive and procedural aspects of due process; in order that a particular act may not be impugned as violative of the due process clause, there must be compliance with both substantive and the procedural requirements thereof. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



Substantive due process refers to the intrinsic validity of a law that interferes with the rights of a person to his property; in labor cases, it refers to the grounds/basis of terminating an employee; on the other hand, procedural due process means compliance with the procedures or steps prescribed by the law; this refers to the employer's act of affording the employee to explain his/her side through the two notices required by the law (notice to explain and notice to terminate). (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



#### EJECTMENT



Complaint for 
- Section 17, Rule 70 of the Rules is silent with regard to the restitution of money received as down payment for the sale of the subject property as it only mentions restitution of the premises; a monetary claim other than those specifically enumerated in Section 17, Rule 70 of the Rules is not recoverable in an ejectment case. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



Under Section 17, Rule 70 of the Rules, if after the trial, the MTC finds that the allegations of the complaint for ejectment are true, the reliefs that may be granted to the plaintiff in the judgment are limited only to the following: (1) restitution of the premises; (2) the sum justly due as arrears of rent or as a reasonable compensation for the occupation and use of the premises; (3) attorney's fees; and

(4) costs; any monetary award beyond what is permissible under the Rules is beyond the jurisdiction of the MTC. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



#### EMPLOYMENT, TERMINATION OF



Abandonment 
- Mere absence from work, even after a notice to return, is insufficient to prove abandonment; records are bereft of any indication that petitioners' failure to report for work was with a clear intent to sever their employment relationship with respondent company. (Lusabia, et al. vs. Super K Drug Corporation, et al., G.R. 223314, July 15, 2020)



To prove abandonment, the employer must show that the employee unjustifiably refused to report for work and that the employee deliberately intended to sever the employer-employee relationship; intent to sever the employer-employee

relationship can be proven through the overt acts of an employee; the overt acts, after being considered as a whole, must clearly show the employee's objective of discontinuing his or her employment. (Lusabia, et al. vs. Super K Drug Corporation, et al., G.R. 223314, July 15, 2020)



Constructive dismissal 
- Although the Labor Code does not provide a specific provision for temporary "off-detail" or "floating status," the Court has consistently applied Article 292 of the Labor Code to set the period of employees' temporary "off- detail" or "floating status" to a maximum of six (6) months; petitioner's "floating status" beyond six (6) months sans any valid justification amounted to constructive dismissal; he had already been constructively dismissed long before the security agency served him a notice of termination under Memorandum dated September 31, 2013. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



Constructive dismissal, otherwise known as constructive discharge, is a form of illegal dismissal; constructive dismissal does not always entail a "forthright dismissal or diminution in rank, compensation, benefit and privileges"; pertinent in the case at hand, there can also be constructive dismissal in cases where "an act of clear discrimination, insensibility, or disdain by an employer becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee that it could foreclose any choice by him or her except to forego his or her continued employment." (Jacob vs. First Step Manpower Int'l. Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 229984, July 8, 2020)



In Peak Ventures Corp. v. Heirs of Villareal, the Court ruled that where there is constructive dismissal, backwages must be computed from the time the employee was unjustly relieved from duty since it was from this point that his compensation was withheld from him. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



To gauge if constructive dismissal exists, the test is whether a reasonable person in the employee's standing was impelled to surrender his or her post under the given situation; it is a dismissal in disguise because the doing equates to a "dismissal, but made to appear as if it were not"; "the law recognizes and resolves this situation in favor of employees in order to protect their rights and interests from the coercive acts of the employer." (Jacob vs. First Step Manpower Int'l. Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 229984, July 8, 2020)



Deeds of release, waivers, or quitclaims 
- As a general rule, "deeds of release, waivers, or quitclaims cannot bar employees from demanding benefits to which they are legally entitled or from contesting the legality of their dismissal, since quitclaims are looked upon with disfavor and are frowned upon as contrary to public policy"; the burden of proving that petitioner voluntarily entered into the agreement lies with the employer, which in this case, respondents miserably failed to do. (Jacob vs. First Step Manpower Int'l. Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 229984, July 8, 2020)



Fraud and dishonesty 
- Fraud and dishonesty can only be used to justify the dismissal of an employee when the latter commits a dishonest act that reflects a disposition to deceive, defraud, and betray his employer. (Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation vs. Guerrero, G.R. 229013, July 15, 2020)



Gross misconduct 
- Imposition of the ultimate penalty of dismissal from service is too harsh a penalty where the employee‘s infractions do not constitute gross negligence or serious misconduct; even where a worker has committed an infraction, a penalty less punitive may suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not to be visited with a consequence so severe. (Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation vs. Guerrero, G.R. 229013, July 15, 2020)



In Bookmedia Press, Inc. v. Sinajon and Abenir, the Court stressed the requirement of willfulness or wrongful intent in the appreciation of gross or serious misconduct as just cause for termination, viz.: serious misconduct and willful disobedience of an employer's lawful order may only be appreciated when the employee's transgression of a rule, duty or directive has been the product of "wrongful intent" or of a "wrongful and perverse attitude," but not when the same transgression results from simple negligence or "mere error in judgment." (Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation vs. Guerrero, G.R. 229013, July 15, 2020)



Illegal dismissal 
- An illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement or payment of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, and backwages. (Lusabia, et al. vs. Super K Drug Corporation, et al., G.R. 223314, July 15, 2020)



An illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and full backwages computed from the time of his dismissal up to the time of his actual reinstatement; award of attorney‘s fees and imposition of six percent (6 percent ) legal interest per annum on monetary awards, proper. (Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation vs. Guerrero, G.R. 229013, July 15, 2020)



As regular employees, petitioners cannot be terminated from employment without any just and/or authorized cause. (Espina, et al. vs. Highlands Camp/Rawlings Foundation, Inc., et al., G.R. 220935, July 28, 2020)



Illegally dismissed employee entitled to moral damages, exemplary damages and attorney‘s fees. (Jacob vs. First Step Manpower Int'l. Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 229984, July 8, 2020)



It is an established principle that the dismissal of an employee is justified where there was a just cause and the employee was afforded due process prior to dismissal; the burden of proof to establish these twin requirements is on the

employer, who must present clear, accurate, consistent, and convincing evidence to that effect. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



It is settled that the burden to prove payment rests on the employer because all pertinent personnel files, payrolls, records, remittances and other similar documents are in the custody and control of the employer. (Lusabia, et al. vs. Super K Drug Corporation, et al., G.R. 223314, July 15, 2020)



Settled is the rule that an employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to full backwages and reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges, computed from the time his compensation was withheld up to the time of actual reinstatement; where reinstatement is no longer viable as an option, separation pay equivalent to one month for every year of service should be awarded as an alternative. (MagtibaY vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al., G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



There being no authorized cause for petitioner's dismissal under DO 14-01 or Article 297 of the Labor Code, what should apply here instead are the usual remedies or relief which illegally or constructively dismissed employees are entitled to, viz.: (1) reinstatement or separation pay equivalent to one (1) month salary for every year of service; and (2) backwages; these two (2) are exclusive and awarded conjunctively. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



Just and valid cause 
- In termination cases, the burden of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal is for a just and valid cause; failure to do so would necessarily mean that the dismissal was illegal; for this purpose, the employer must present substantial evidence to prove the legality of the employee's dismissal. (Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation vs. Guerrero, G.R. 229013, July 15, 2020)



Just or authorized cause 
- Article 294 of Presidential Decree No. 442, also known as the Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended and renumbered, protects the employee's security of tenure by mandating that "in cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title"; a lawful dismissal must meet both substantive and procedural requirements; in fine, the dismissal must be for a just or authorized cause and must comply with the rudimentary due process of notice and hearing. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



In labor cases, the burden of proving that the termination of an employee was for a just or authorized cause lies with the employer; if the employer fails to meet this burden, the conclusion is that the dismissal was unjustified and, therefore, illegal; moreover, not only must the dismissal be for a cause provided by law, it should

also comply with the rudimentary requirements of due process, that is, the opportunity to be heard and defend one's self. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al.,

G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)

In the absence of a clear, valid, and legal cause for the termination of employment, the law considers the dismissal illegal and the burden is on the employer to prove that the termination was for a valid or authorized cause under the Labor Code; it is not incumbent upon dismissed employees to prove their innocence of the employer's accusations against them. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



It bears stressing that in termination cases, the onus of proving the validity of dismissal lies with the employer; the quantum of proof which the employer must discharge is substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other minds, equally reasonable, might conceivably opine otherwise. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



It is already doctrinal that an employee may only be dismissed for just or authorized causes; the legality of dismissal of an employee hinges on: (a) the legality of the act of dismissal; that is dismissal on the grounds provided for under the Labor Code and (b) the legality in the manner of dismissal. (SPC Power Corporation, et al. vs. Santos, G.R. 202379, July 27, 2020)



Monetary claims 
- With respect to labor cases, the burden of proving payment of monetary claims rests on the employer; the rationale for this is that the pertinent personnel files, payrolls, records, remittances and other similar documents which will show that overtime, differentials, service incentive leave and other claims of workers have been paid are not in the possession of the worker but in the custody and absolute control of the employer. (Marby Food Ventures Corporation, et al. vs. Dela Cruz, et al., G.R. 244629, July 28, 2020)



Neglect of duty 
- To be a valid ground for dismissal, neglect of duty must be both gross and habitual; gross negligence implies want of or failure to exercise slight care or diligence in the performance of one's duties; it evinces a thoughtless disregard of consequences without exerting any effort to avoid them; habitual neglect, on the other hand, implies repeated failure to perform one's duties for a period of time. (Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation vs. Guerrero, G.R. 229013, July 15, 2020)



Redundancy 
- Redundancy is an authorized cause for termination of employment under Article 298 (formerly Article 283) of the Labor Code; it exists when "the services of an employee are in excess of what is reasonably demanded by the actual requirements of the enterprise"; it can be due to "a number of factors, such as the overhiring of workers, a decrease in the volume of business or the dropping of a particular line or service previously manufactured or undertaken by the
enterprise." (Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc./Tiwi Consolidated Union (APRI- TCU) on Behalf of Fe R. Rubio, et al. vs. Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc., et al.,

G.R. 237036, July 8, 2020)



The determination of whether the employees' services are no longer necessary or sustainable, and therefore, properly terminable for redundancy, is an exercise of business judgment; in making such decision, however, management must not violate the law nor declare redundancy without sufficient basis; to ensure that the dismissal is not implemented arbitrarily, jurisprudence requires the employer to prove, among others, its good faith in abolishing the redundant positions as well as the existence of fair and reasonable criteria in the selection of employees who will be dismissed from employment due to redundancy. (Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc./Tiwi Consolidated Union (APRI-TCU) on Behalf of Fe R. Rubio, et al. vs. Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc., et al., G.R. 237036, July 8, 2020)



Retrenchment 
- A valid retrenchment may only be exercised after the employer has proved compliance with the procedural and substantive requisites of valid retrenchment; absent any of these, then the dismissal is illegal; the procedural requisites for a valid retrenchment are provided for in [Article 298. [283]] of the Labor Code, the employer must serve a written notice on the employee and the Department of Labor and Employment one month before the date of the dismissal, and pay the required amount of separation pay. (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



In La Consolacion College of Manila v. Pascua, this Court enumerated three substantive requisites for a valid retrenchment, thus, for a valid retrenchment, the employer must show that: (a) retrenchment was a necessary measure to prevent substantial and serious business losses; (b) it was done in good faith and not to defeat employees' rights; and (c) the employer was fair and reasonable in selecting the employees who will be retrenched. (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



Under Article 298 of the Labor Code, retrenchment is one of the authorized causes to dismiss an employee; it involves a reduction in the workforce, resorted to when the employer encounters business reverses, losses, or economic difficulties, such as "recessions, industrial depressions, or seasonal fluctuations." (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



Separation pay 
- It has long been settled that separation pay or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is called, shall not be granted to all employees when the cause of their dismissal is any of the grounds provided under Article 282 of the Labor Code; relaxation of this rule, pursuant to the principle of social justice, may be warranted only when exceptional or peculiar circumstances attend the case. (American Express Transnational (now American International Tours, Inc.), et al. vs. Borre, G.R. 228320, July 15, 2020)



Neither accepting separation pay nor signing a waiver and quitclaim bars the employee from contesting the legality of the dismissal; such acts are generally taken with a grain of salt, considering that employees are usually at an economic disadvantage and are often left with no choice, since they are suddenly faced with the pressure to meet financial burdens. (Team Pacific Corporation, et al. vs. Parente, G.R. 206789, July 15, 2020)



Separation pay is granted when: a) the relationship between the employer and the illegally dismissed employee is already strained; and b) a considerable length of time had already passed rendering it impossible for the employee to return to work; a prayer for separation pay is an indication of the strained relations between the parties. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



Separation pay is only warranted: (1) when the cause of termination is not attributable to the employee's fault, such as those provided under Articles 283 and 284 of the Labor Code; and (2) in cases of illegal dismissal in which reinstatement is no longer feasible; by way of exception, however, the Court has allowed the grant of separation pay based on equity and as a measure of social justice; this exception is justified by the positive commands for the promotion of social justice and the protection of the rights of the workers replete in our Constitution. (American Express Transnational (now American International Tours, Inc.), et al. vs. Borre, G.R. 228320, July 15, 2020)



Willful disobedience or insubordination 
- An employee dismissed for willful disobedience is not entitled to a grant of separation pay; compassion for the poor is an imperative of every humane society but only when the recipient is not a rascal claiming an undeserved privilege, as social justice cannot be permitted to be a refuge of scoundrels any more than can equity be an impediment to the punishment of the guilty. (American Express Transnational (now American International Tours, Inc.), et al. vs. Borre, G.R. 228320, July 15, 2020)



Jurisprudence dictates that for an employee to be validly dismissed on the ground of willful disobedience, the employer must prove by substantial evidence that: (a) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful or intentional, the willfulness being characterized by a wrongful and perverse attitude; and (b) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge. (American Express Transnational (now American International Tours, Inc.), et al. vs. Borre,

G.R. 228320, July 15, 2020)



Not every case of insubordination or willful disobedience of an employee of a work-related order is penalized with dismissal; there must be "reasonable proportionality" between the willful disobedience and the penalty imposed

therefor. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



Willful disobedience or insubordination requires the concurrence of two (2) requisites: (1) the employee's assailed conduct must have been willful which is characterized by a wrongful and perverse attitude; and (2) the order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee, and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge. (Ador vs. Jamila and Company Security Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 245422, July 7, 2020)



#### EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS



Valid and reasonable classification 
- To be valid and reasonable, the classification must satisfy the following requirements: (1) it must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) it must be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it must not be limited to existing conditions only; and (4) it must apply equally to all members of the same class. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



#### ESTAFA


Estafa through misappropriation 
- Article 315 of the RPC punishes criminal fraud resulting to damage capable of pecuniary estimation; the elements of estafa through misappropriation under paragraph 1(b), Article 315 of the RPC are: 1. That money, goods or other personal properties are received by the offender in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to return the same; 2. That there is a misappropriation or conversion of such money or property by the offender or denial on his part of the receipt thereof; 3. That the misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the prejudice of another; and 4. That there is a demand made by the offended party on the offender. (Reside vs. People, G.R. 210318, July 28, 2020)



There is an essential distinction between the possession by a receiving teller of funds received from third persons paid to the bank, and an agent who receives the proceeds of sales of merchandise delivered to him in agency by his principal; in the former case, payment by third persons to the teller is payment to the bank itself; the teller is a mere custodian or keeper of the funds received, and has no independent right or title to retain or possess the same as against the bank; an agent, on the other hand, can even assert, as against his own principal, an independent, autonomous, right to retain the money or goods received in consequence of the agency; as when the principal fails to reimburse him for advances he has made, and indemnify him for damages suffered without his fault. (Reside vs. People, G.R. 210318, July 28, 2020)

Therefore, as it now stands, a sum of money received by an employee in behalf of an employer is considered to be only in the material possession of the employee; such material possession of an employee is adjunct, by reason of his employment, to a recognition of the juridical possession of the employer; as long as the juridical possession of the thing appropriated did not pass to the employee, the offense committed is theft, qualified or otherwise. (Reside vs. People, G.R. 210318, July 28, 2020)



When the money, goods, or any other personal property is received by the offender from the offended party (1) in trust, or (2) on commission, or (3) for administration, the offender acquires both material or physical possession and juridical possession of the thing received; mere receipt of the money, goods, or personal property does not suffice, it is also essential that the accused acquired both material or physical possession and juridical possession of the thing received; juridical possession refers to a possession which gives the transferee a right over the thing transferred and this, he may set up even against the owner. (Reside vs. People, G.R. 210318, July 28, 2020)



#### ESTOPPEL



Estoppel by laches 
- Estoppel by laches bars a party from invoking lack of jurisdiction in an unjustly belated manner especially when it actively participated during trial. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



#### EVIDENCE



Best evidence rule 
- The necessary import and rationale behind the requirement under the Best Evidence Rule is the avoidance of the dangers of mistransmissions and inaccuracies of the content of the documents; this is squarely true in the present disbarment complaint, with a main charge that turns on the very accuracy, completeness, and authenticity of the documents submitted into evidence. (Basagan vs. Espina, A.C. No. 8395, July 8, 2020)



Burden of proof 
- The party who alleges a fact has the burden of proving it, as bare allegations warrant no merit; it is incumbent upon the plaintiff who is claiming a right to prove his case, and the defendant to prove its own allegations to buttress its claim that it is not liable. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



Clear and convincing evidence 
- Clear and convincing evidence is less than proof beyond reasonable doubt but greater than preponderance of evidence; the degree of believability upon an imputation of fraud in a civil case is higher than that of an ordinary civil case, the latter generally requiring only a preponderance of evidence to meet the required burden of proof. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)

Parol evidence rule 
- The parol evidence rule provides that "when the terms of an agreement have been reduced into writing, it is considered containing all the terms agreed upon and there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other than the contents of the written agreement." (Cuadra, et al. vs. San Miguel Corporation, G.R. 194467, July 13, 2020)



Preponderance of 
- Basics is the evidentiary rule that the who alleges a fact bears the burden of proof; in civil cases, it is the plaintiff who has the burden of proof and who is required to establish his case by preponderance of evidence; that the pieces of evidence must be credible, admissible, and sufficient to meet the quantum of evidence required in proving his claims as the extent of the relief to be granted can only be as much as has been alleged and proved during trial while satisfying the quantum of evidence required in a case. (Palafox, represented by his attorney- in-fact, Efraim B. Orodio vs. Wangdali, et al., G.R. 235914, July 29, 2020)



Presentation of 
- Errors in, or even absence of, notarization on a deed of mortgage will not invalidate an already perfected mortgage agreement; if anything, these would only depreciate the evidentiary value of the said written deed, as the same would be demoted from a public document to a private one. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



Quantum of 
- The quantum of evidence required in a civil action is mere "preponderance of evidence," in contrast to "proof beyond reasonable doubt" which is required for conviction in a criminal action; being independent from criminal action, the conviction or acquittal of the accused is not a bar to an independent suit for damages in a civil action. (Escandor vs. People, G.R. 211962, July 6, 2020)



Res gestae 
- Generally, a witness can only give a testimony with respect to matters of which he or she has personal knowledge; testimonies which are hearsay are inadmissible as evidence; the rules, however, allow for certain exceptions; one of which is when the evidence is part of res gestae. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



In general, the test is whether or not an act, declaration, or exclamation is "so intimately interwoven or connected with the principal fact or event that it characterizes as to be regarded as a part of the transaction itself, and also whether it clearly negatives any premeditation or purpose to manufacture testimony." (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



In People v. Cudal, this Court explained: The spontaneity of the utterance and its logical connection with the principal event, coupled with the fact that the utterance was made while the declarant was still "strong" and subject to the stimulus of the nervous excitement of the principal event, are deemed to preclude

contrivance, deliberation, design or fabrication, and to give to the utterance an inherent guaranty of trustworthiness. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



One of the most basic rules on the admissibility of evidence states that "a witness can testify only to those facts which he or she knows of his or her personal knowledge; that is, which are derived from his or her own perception"; anything that is not based on a witness' own personal knowledge shall be barred as hearsay; however, an exception to the hearsay rule is a declaration that forms part of the res gestae. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



People v. Salafranca mentioned two requisites for applying the res gestae rule: "(i) the act, declaration or exclamation is so intimately interwoven or connected with the principal fact or event that it characterizes as to be regarded as a part of the transaction itself; and (ii) the said evidence clearly negatives any premeditation or purpose to manufacture testimony"; similarly, in People v. Jorolan, the Court stressed that there must be no intervening circumstance between the res gestae occurrence and the time the statement was uttered that could have allowed the declarant an opportunity to deliberate and reflect. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



Res gestae is one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule; it contemplates testimonial evidence on matters not personally witnessed by the witness, but is relayed to him or her by a declarant. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



Res gestae refers to "those circumstances which are the undesigned incidents of a particular litigated act and which are admissible when illustrative of such act"; it contemplates statements that were "voluntarily and spontaneously made so nearly contemporaneous as to be in the presence of the transaction which they illustrate and explain and were made under such circumstances as necessarily to exclude the idea of design or deliberation." (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



Rule 130, Section 42 states: Section 42. Part of res gestae; statements made by a person while a starting occurrence is taking place or immediately prior or subsequent thereto with respect to the circumstances thereof, may be given in evidence as part of res gestae; statements accompanying an equivocal act material to the issue, and giving it a legal significance, may be received as part of the res gestae. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



The Court enumerated the factors that may aid in determining whether the utterances were in fact "spontaneous": there is no hard and fast rule by which spontaneity may be determined although a number of factors have been considered, including, but not always confined to: (1) the time that has lapsed

between the occurrence of the act or transaction and the making of the statement; (2) the place where the statement is made; (3) the condition of the declarant when the utterance is given; (4) the presence or absence of intervening events between the occurrence and the statement relative thereto; and (5) the nature and the circumstances of the statement itself. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



The following factors may guide courts in determining whether there is spontaneity in the declarant's statements, to wit: (1) the time that lapsed between the occurrence of the act or transaction and the making of the statement; (2) the place where the statement was made; (3) the condition of the declarant when he made the statement; (4) the presence or absence of intervening events between the occurrence and the statement relative thereto; and (5) the nature and circumstances of the statement itself. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



There are two (2) acts which form part of the res gestae: (1) in spontaneous exclamations where the res gestae is the startling occurrence; and (2) in verbal acts where res gestae is the statement accompanying the equivocal act; to be admissible under the first class of res gestae, the following elements must be present: (1) that the principal act, the res gestae, be a startling occurrence; (2) that the statements were made before the declarant had time to contrive or devise; (3) that the statements made must concern the occurrence in question and its immediately attending circumstances; under the second class of res gestae, the following requisites must be present: 1) the principal act to be characterized must be equivocal; (2) the equivocal act must be material to the issue; 3) the statement must accompany the equivocal acts; and (4) the statements give a legal significance to the equivocal act. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. Plc., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



Substantial evidence 
- Consistent with the basic standard in labor cases and administrative proceedings, the degree of proof required is substantial evidence or that amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify the conclusion; substantial evidence is more than a scintilla; the evidence must be real and substantial, and not merely apparent. (Razonable, Jr. vs. Torm Shipping Philippines, Inc. et al., G.R. 241620, July 7, 2020)



Substantial evidence is such amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if other equally reasonable minds might opine otherwise. (Jacob vs. First Step Manpower Int'l. Services, Inc., et al., G.R. 229984, July 8, 2020)



Weight and sufficiency of 
- Rule 133, Section 2 of the Revised Rules on Evidence requires proof beyond reasonable doubt for an accused's conviction; the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt in a criminal case finds its basis in the due process clause and in an accused's presumption of innocence, both
enshrined in the Constitution. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



#### EXPEDITIOUS IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS (R.A. 8975)



Application of 
- R.A. 8975 prohibits the issuance by all courts, other than the Supreme Court, of any temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, or preliminary mandatory injunctions against national government projects; the NCCA is not a court as contemplated by R.A. 8975; NCCA‘s authority to issue a CDO is by virtue of R.A. 10066. (Bernal, in his capacity as the Authorized Managing Officer of Ciara Construction/Berson Construction & Trading (a Joint Venture) vs. De Leon, Jr., in his capacity as Chairman of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), et al., G.R. 219792, July 29, 2020)



#### FORUM SHOPPING



Principle of 
- Forum shopping is committed by a party who institutes two or more suits in different courts, either simultaneously or successively, in order to ask the courts to rule on the same or related causes or to grant the same or substantially the same reliefs, on the supposition that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition or increase a party's chances of obtaining a favorable decision or action. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



To determine whether there is forum shopping, it is necessary to ascertain "whether the elements of litis pendentia are present, or whether a final judgment in one case will amount to res judicata in another‖; the test is "whether in the two (or more) cases pending, there is identity of parties, rights or causes of action, and reliefs sought." (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



#### FRUSTRATED HOMICIDE



Award of damages 
- People v. Jugueta instructs that where the crime of frustrated homicide is committed, moral damages as well as civil indemnity should be awarded to the victim in the amount of P30,000.00 each. (Naag, Jr., et al. vs. People, G.R. 228638, July 13, 2020)



Commission of 
- Elements: (1) the accused intended to kill his victim, as manifested by his use of a deadly weapon in his assault; (2) the victim sustained fatal or mortal wound/s but did not die because of timely medical assistance; and (3) none of the qualifying circumstances for murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC) is present. (Naag, Jr., et al. vs. People, G.R. 228638, July 13, 2020)



#### GUIDELINES FOR THE PROPER USE OF THE PHRASE "WITHOUT ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE" IN INDIVISIBLE PENALTIES (A.M. NO. 15-08-02-SC)



Application of 
- The Court finds that there is no need to add the qualification "without eligibility for parole" in this case; Administrative Matter (A.M.) No. 15-08-02- SC pertinently provides: Parole is extended only to those convicted of divisible penalties; reclusion perpetua is an indivisible penalty and carries no minimum nor maximum period; with no "minimum penalty" imposable on those convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua, then even prior to the enactment of R.A. 9346, persons sentenced by final judgment to reclusion perpetua could not have availed of parole under the Indeterminate Sentence Law. (People vs. Silvederio III, G.R. 239777, July 8, 2020)



#### HUMAN RELATIONS



Abuse of rights 
- Article 19, which only lays down a rule of conduct, is read together with Articles 20 and 21, which authorize an action for damages; Article 20 pertains to damage arising from a violation of law, while Article 21 provides damages for those who suffered material and moral injury. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



The elements of an abuse of rights under Article 19 are: (1) there is a legal right or duty; (2) which is exercised in bad faith; (3) for the sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another; when Article 19 is violated, an action for damages is proper under Article 20 and 21 of the New Civil Code; Article 20 pertains to damages arising from a violation of law. (Navarro-Banaria vs. Banaria, et al., G.R. 217806, July 28, 2020)



To be awarded damages under the abuse of rights principle, the following elements must be proven: (1) there is a legal right or duty; (2) the legal right or duty was exercised in bad faith; and (3) it was done for the sole intent of prejudicing or injuring another. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



While Article 19 of the New Civil Code may have been intended as a mere declaration of principle, the "cardinal law on human conduct" expressed in said article has given rise to certain rules, e.g., that where a person exercises his rights but does so arbitrarily or unjustly or performs his duties in a manner that is not in keeping with honesty and good faith, he opens himself to liability. (Navarro- Banaria, vs. Banaria, et al., G.R. 217806, July 28, 2020)



Rule on 
- Petitioner‘s failure to observe good faith in the exercise of her right as the wife and legal guardian of her physically and mentally infirmed husband has caused loss and injury on the part of respondents, for which they must be compensated by way of damages pursuant to Article 21 of the Civil Code. (Navarro-Banaria, vs. Banaria, et al., G.R. 217806, July 28, 2020)



#### INSURANCE



Mortgage redemption insurance 
- Upon issuance of a notice of approval/letter of guaranty the loan and mortgage agreement between the parties takes effect including its provisions on MRI coverage. (Home Development Mutual Fund (HDMF) vs. Sps. Cataquiz, G.R. 210582, July 29, 2020)



Right of subrogation 
- The insurer, after satisfaction of the insurance claim of the insured, may collect payment from the third party whose negligence caused the loss. (Pioneer Insurance & Surety Corporation vs. Tan also known as Carmen S.F. Gatmaytan and/or Unknown Owner/Proprietor of Save More Drug doing business under the name and style of Save More Drug, G.R. 239989, July 13, 2020)



#### INTERIM RULES UNDER SECURITIES REGULATIONS CODE (R.A. 8799)



Intra-corporate controversy 
- In determining whether a case is an intra-corporate controversy, We resort to a combined application of the relationship test and the nature of the controversy test; under the relationship test, the existence of any of the following relations makes the conflict intra-corporate: (1) between the corporation, partnership or association and the public; (2) between the corporation, partnership or association and the State insofar as its franchise, permit or license to operate is concerned; (3) between the corporation, partnership or association and its stockholders, partners, members or officers; and (4) among the stockholders, partners or associates themselves; for as long as any of these intra-corporate relationships exists between the parties, the controversy would be characterized as intra-corporate. (Bank of the Philippine Islands vs. Bacalla, Jr., et al., G.R. 223404, July 15, 2020)



#### INTERVENTION



Complaint for 
- Intervention is a remedy by which a third party, not originally impleaded in the proceedings, becomes a litigant therein for a certain purpose: to enable the third party to protect or preserve a right or interest that may be affected by those proceedings; however, it is not an absolute right for the statutory rules or conditions for the right of intervention must be shown. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



To allow intervention: (a) it must be shown that the movant has legal interest in the matter in litigation, or is otherwise qualified; and (b) consideration must be given as to whether the adjudication of the rights of the original parties may be delayed or prejudiced, or whether the intervenor‘s rights may be protected in a separate proceeding or not; both requirements must concur, as the first is not more important than the second. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



To sum it up, the legal interest as qualifying factor must be of a direct and immediate character so that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation of the judgment; in all cases, the allowance or disallowance of a

Motion for Intervention rests on the sound discretion of the court after consideration of the appropriate circumstances. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### JUDGES



Duties 
- To be able to render substantial justice and maintain public confidence in the legal system, judges should be embodiments of competence, integrity and independence; they are expected to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural rules and to apply them properly in all good faith; they are likewise expected to demonstrate mastery of the principles of law, keep abreast of prevailing jurisprudence, and discharge their duties in accordance therewith. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17- 2503, July 28, 2020)



Grave abuse of discretion 
- A judge who obstinately disregards established rules of procedure does not merely err in judgment, but commits grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction; judges are expected to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural laws, and must apply them properly in good faith as judicial competence requires no less. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



The exercise of judicial functions does not merely involve a cold, mechanical application of the law, or a routinary resolution of issues; rather, it ultimately calls for the dispensation of justice; a judge who fails to carry out her basic, solemn duty, disregards settled norms and facilitated an injustice, commits grave abuse of discretion. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Gross ignorance of the law 
- A judge may also be administratively liable for gross ignorance of the law if shown to have been motivated by bad faith, fraud, dishonesty or corruption in ignoring, contradicting or failing to apply settled law and jurisprudence; for liability to attach, the assailed order, decision or actuation of the judge in the performance of official duties must not only be found erroneous but, most importantly, it must also be established that he was moved by bad faith, dishonesty, hatred, or some other like motive. (Cayabyab vs. Pangilinan, Jr., Regional Trial Court, Branch 58, Angeles City, Pampanga, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2584, July 28, 2020)



A judge who grants bail applications without prior hearing and fails to state the factual and legal reasons for the grant of bail in his orders or resolutions, commits gross ignorance of the law and procedure, which is classified as a serious charge. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17-2503, July 28, 2020)

Judges should maintain competence and diligence which are prerequisites to the due performance of judicial office; their role in the administration of justice requires a continuous study of the law and jurisprudence; contrary rule will not only lessen the faith of the people in the courts but will also defeat the fundamental role of the judiciary to render justice and promote the rule of law. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17-2503, July 28, 2020)



Penalty of dismissal from the service, imposed upon the respondent judge for multiple counts of gross ignorance of the law; the court could no longer afford to be lenient to a judge who repeatedly commits infractions and refuses to correct his ways despite previous warning, lest it would give the public the impression that incompetence and repeated offenders are being countenanced in the judiciary. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17-2503, July 28, 2020)



Unfamiliarity with the laws and procedures is a sign of incompetence which betrays the confidence of the public in the courts; judges ought to simply apply basic, simple and well-known rules and jurisprudence; anything less is ignorance of the law. (Office of the Court Administrator vs. Hon. Flor, Jr., Presiding Judge, Branch 28, Regional Trial Court, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya, A.M. No. RTJ-17- 2503, July 28, 2020)



Inhibition 
- Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court contemplates two (2) kinds of inhibition: (a) compulsory; and (b) voluntary; under the first paragraph of the aforecited Rule, it is conclusively presumed that judges cannot actively and impartially sit in the instances mentioned; the second paragraph, which embodies voluntary inhibition, leaves to the sound discretion of the judges concerned whether to sit in a case for other just and valid reasons, with only their conscience as guide; it is the latter kind of inhibition which rests on the subjective ground of conscience; that is why cases under such category should be analyzed on a case- to-case basis. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Knowingly rendering an unjust judgment 
- Knowingly rendering an unjust judgment constitutes a serious criminal offense under Article 204 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC); to commit the offense, the offender must be a judge who is adequately shown to have rendered an unjust judgment, not one who merely committed an error of judgment or taken the unpopular side of a controversial point of law. (Cayabyab vs. Pangilinan, Jr., Regional Trial Court, Branch 58, Angeles City, Pampanga, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2584, July 28, 2020)



Raffle of cases 
- No case may be assigned without being raffled, and no judge may choose the cases assigned to him; the raffle of cases is intended to ensure the impartial adjudication of cases by protecting the integrity of the process of
distributing or assigning cases to judges; such process assures the public that the right of the parties to be heard by an impartial and unbiased tribunal is safeguarded while also protecting judges from any suspicion of impropriety. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Undue delay in rendering decision 
- Article VIII, Section 15 of the 1987 Constitution expressly prescribes that all cases or matters must be decided or resolved by the lower courts within three (3) months from date of submission; in parallel, Canon 6, Section 5 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct requires judges to perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved decisions, efficiently, fairly and with reasonable promptness. (Cayabyab vs. Pangilinan, Jr., Regional Trial Court, Branch 58, Angeles City, Pampanga, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2584, July 28, 2020)



In cases where a judge is unable to comply with the reglementary period for deciding cases or matters, he or she can, for good reasons, ask for an extension from the Court; as a general rule, requests for extension are granted by the Court in cognizance of the heavy caseload of the trial courts. (Cayabyab vs. Pangilinan, Jr., Regional Trial Court, Branch 58, Angeles City, Pampanga, A.M. No. RTJ-20- 2584, July 28, 2020)



Time and again, the Court has impressed upon judges the importance of deciding cases promptly and expeditiously because the notion of delay in the disposition of cases and matters undermines the people's faith and confidence in the judiciary; the honor and integrity of the judicial system is measured not only by the fairness and correctness of decisions rendered, but also by the efficiency with which disputes are resolved. (Cayabyab vs. Pangilinan, Jr., Regional Trial Court, Branch 58, Angeles City, Pampanga, A.M. No. RTJ-20-2584, July 28, 2020)



#### JUDGMENTS



Annulment of 
- A complaint for quieting of title filed to assail the partially void judgment of the MTC shall be considered a petition for annulment of judgment in the interest of justice and equity. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



A petition for annulment of judgment is a remedy in equity so exceptional in nature that it may be availed of only when other remedies are wanting, and only if the judgment, final order or final resolution sought to be annulled was rendered by a court lacking jurisdiction or through extrinsic fraud. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



Given the extraordinary nature and the objective of the remedy of annulment of judgment or final order, a petitioner must comply with the statutory requirements as set forth under Rule 47; these are: (1) the remedy is available only when the petitioner can no longer resort to the ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for relief or other appropriate remedies through no fault of the petitioner;

(2) the grounds for action of annulment of judgment are limited to either extrinsic fraud or lack of jurisdiction; (3) the action must be filed within four years from the discovery of the extrinsic fraud; and if based on lack of jurisdiction, must be raised before it is barred by laches or estoppel; and (4) the petition must be verified, and should allege with particularity the facts and the law relied upon for annulment, as well as those supporting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or defense, as the case may be. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



In the interest of judicial economy, the complaint filed before the RTC may be treated as an action for annulment of judgment rather than for quieting of title; this will avoid multiplicity of actions and save the litigants and the Court their resources; Section 10, Rule 47 of the Rules requires that an action to annul a judgment or final order of an MTC shall be filed in the RTC having jurisdiction over the former. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



The grounds for annulment of judgment are: (1) extrinsic fraud; (2) lack of jurisdiction; and (3) denial of due process; lack of jurisdiction, as a ground for annulment of judgment, refers to either lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defending party or over the subject matter of the claim. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



The judgment may be annulled on the ground of extrinsic or collateral fraud; a person who is not a party to the judgment may sue for its annulment provided he can prove that the same was obtained through fraud or collusion and that he would be adversely affected thereby; the other ground for annulment of judgments or final orders and resolutions is lack of jurisdiction on the part of the court which adjudicated the case; this refers to either lack of jurisdiction over the person of the defending party or over the subject matter of the claim; case law, however, recognizes a third ground 
- denial of due process of law. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



The prevailing rule is that where there is want of jurisdiction over a subject matter, the judgment is rendered null and void; a void judgment is in legal effect no judgment, by which no rights are divested, from which no right can be obtained, which neither binds nor bars any one, and under which all acts performed and all claims flowing out are void; it is not a decision in contemplation of law and, hence, it can never become executory; it also follows that such a void judgment cannot constitute a bar to another case by reason of res judicata. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



Conflict between the dispositive part and the body 
- The general rule is that where there is a conflict between the fallo, or the dispositive part, and the body of the decision or order, the fallo prevails on the theory that the fallo is the final order and becomes the subject of execution, while the body of the decision merely contains the reasons or conclusions of the court ordering nothing; however, where

one can clearly and unquestionably conclude from the body of the decision that there was a mistake in the dispositive portion, the body of the decision will prevail. (ABC vs. People, G.R. 241591, July 8, 2020)



Equal protection of the Laws 
- One of the basic principles on which this government was founded is that of the equality of right which is embodied in Section 1, Article III of the 1987 Constitution; the equal protection of the laws is embraced in the concept of due process, as every unfair discrimination offends the requirements of justice and fair play; it has been embodied in a separate clause, however, to provide for a more specific guaranty against any form of undue favoritism or hostility from the government. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



Execution of 
- Under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, a judgment creditor has two modes in enforcing the court's judgment; execution may be either through motion or an independent action; these two modes of execution are available depending on the timing when the judgment-creditor invoked its right to enforce the court's judgment; on the one hand, execution by motion is only available if the enforcement of the judgment was sought within five (5) years from the date of its entry; on the other hand, execution by independent action is mandatory if the five (5)-year prescriptive period for execution by motion had already elapsed; however, for execution by independent action to prosper, the Rules impose another limitation, the action must be filed before it is barred by the statute of limitations which, under Article 1144 of the Civil Code, is ten (10) years from the finality of the judgment. (Brig. General Collao, Jr., in his capacity as Commanding General, Headquarters and Headquarters Support Group, Philippine Army vs. Albania, G.R. 228905, July 15, 2020)



Final and executory judgments 
- As a rule, "a final and executory judgment can no longer be attacked by any of the parties or be modified, directly or indirectly, even by the highest court of the land"; however, "the Court has relaxed this rule in order to serve substantial justice considering (a) matters of life, liberty, honor or property, (b) the existence of special or compelling circumstances, (c) the merits of the case, (d) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules, and (e) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory.‖ (Tamboa vs. People, G.R. 248264, July 27, 2020)



Even after the judgment has become final, the court retains its jurisdiction to execute and enforce it; there is a difference between the jurisdiction of the court to execute the judgment and its jurisdiction to amend, modify or alter the same; the former continues even after the judgment has become final for the purpose of enforcement of judgment; the latter is terminated when the judgment becomes final; for after the judgment has become final, facts and circumstances may transpire which can render the execution unjust or impossible. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



It can be deduced in Section 4 of Rule 39 that there are three (3) loose categories of final and executory judgments as regards their effects on subsequent and related proceedings; paragraph (a) of the foregoing rule is commonly known to speak of judgments in rem; paragraph (b) is said to refer to judgments in personam; and paragraph (c) is the concept understood in law as "conclusiveness of judgment." (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



The general rule is that orders granting motions to dismiss are subject to appeal or petition for review for they belong to the category of "judgment, final order or resolution" as they dispose of the subject matter in its entirety or terminates a particular proceeding or action, leaving nothing else to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined by the court. (People vs. The Honorable Fourth Division, Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 233061-62, July 28, 2020)



Finality and immutability of judgments 
- In a procedural context, a final and executory judgment may be set aside in one of the following: (a) petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38; (b) direct action to annul and enjoin the enforcement of the judgment; and (c) direct action either by certiorari or by collateral attack against the challenged judgment which is void upon its face, or that the nullity of the judgment is apparent by virtue of its own recitals; this means that some exceptions to the immutability of judgment doctrine have been expanded to include the grounds of the foregoing remedies. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



The doctrine of finality of judgment or immutability of judgment articulates that a decision which has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable; it may no longer be modified in any respect even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and whether it be made by the court that rendered it or by the Highest Court of the land. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



The immutability of judgment doctrine admits of some exceptions which are: (a) the correction of clerical errors; (b) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party; (c) void judgments; and (d) whenever circumstances transpire after the finality of the decision rendering its execution unjust and inequitable; of these exceptions, the last couple of items in the enumeration (void judgments and supervening evident rendering the execution unjust and inequitable) may not be summarily performed by the court concerned because they are necessarily threshed out in another proceeding. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Under the doctrine of finality and immutability of judgment, a decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable, and may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law, and even if the modification is made by the court that

rendered it or by the Highest Court of the land. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



Unless a motion for reconsideration is filed within 15 days from notice of a judgment or order, the judgment or order from which it arose shall become final; a final judgment may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Judgment acquitting the accused 
- The judgment must determine if the act or omission from which the civil liability might arise did not exist: It is essential to indicate whether the act or omission from which the civil liability might arise did not exist; without such declaration, it must be presumed that the acquittal was due to reasonable doubt, and the accused is civilly liable ex delicto. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



Under Rule 120, Section 2 of the 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure, a judgment acquitting the accused must state whether the prosecution absolutely failed to prove the guilt of the accused or merely failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



Judgment based on a compromise agreement 
- As provided by the law on contracts, a valid compromise must have the following elements: (1) consent of the parties to the compromise, (2) an object certain that is the subject matter of the compromise, and (3) the cause of the obligation that is established. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



It is settled that a judgment on compromise is a judgment on the merits; it has the effect of res judicata and is immediately final and executory unless set aside because of falsity or vices of consent; a judicially approved compromise agreement ceases to be a mere contract between the parties, and becomes a judgment of the court, to be enforced through a writ of execution. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



To be valid, an amendment to the compromise agreement must be with the concurrence and consent of all the parties involved. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



Service of 
- Section 1, Rule 37 and Section 1, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court provide that a party has a period of fifteen (15) days from notice of the RTC Decision within which to file either a motion for reconsideration or a petition for review before the CA to assail said RTC Decision; Sections 9, 10, and 13 provide that a party shall be deemed served with the judgment either personally or by registered mail; the service of judgment serves as the reckoning point to determine whether
a decision had been appealed within the reglementary period or has already become final. (Brig. General Collao, Jr., in his capacity as Commanding General, Headquarters and Headquarters Support Group, Philippine Army vs. Albania,

G.R. 228905, July 15, 2020)



Void judgments 
- An order, decision, or resolution rendered with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction is a void judgment; it is no judgment at all in legal contemplation, and can never become final, contrary to petitioners' claim. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



As a rule, a judgment of a court upon a subject within its general jurisdiction, which is not before it by any statement or claim of the parties, and is foreign to the issues submitted for its determination, is a nullity; no error which was not assigned and argued may be considered unless such error is closely related to or dependent on an assigned error or it affects the jurisdiction over the subject matter on the validity of the judgment. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



#### JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT



Constitutional policy of avoidance 
- A court will only pass upon the constitutionality of a statute "to the extent that, it is directly and necessarily involved in a justiciable controversy and is essential to the protection of the rights of the parties concerned"; this is called the constitutional policy of avoidance. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



The Court will not resolve the constitutionality of a law where it is not the very lis mota of the case; exceptions; not present; the power of the courts to act on any grave abuse of discretion by any government branch or instrumentality does not license this court to issue advisory opinions; the constitutionality of Section 9 of Republic Act No. 10641 will not be resolved by the court, as it is not the very lis mota of the case. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



The issue of a statute's constitutionality can only be assailed through a direct attack, with the purported unconstitutionality pleaded directly before the court; in San Miguel Brewery, Inc. v. Magno emphasized that a collateral attack "an attack, made as an incident in another action, whose purpose is to obtain a different relief" on a presumably valid law is forbidden by public policy. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



The legal presumption exists that an enacted law is valid; thus, if the controversy on the constitutionality of a statute can be settled on other grounds, this Court stays its hand from ruling on the constitutional issue. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)

The policy of constitutional avoidance finds its genesis in a concurring opinion on the United States case of Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority; in his concurrence, Justice Louis Brandeis set forth the seven pillars of limitations of judicial review; these rules of avoidance were then summarized in Francisco, Jr.

v. House of Representatives, as follows: the foregoing "pillars" of limitation of judicial review, summarized in Ashwander v. TVA from different decisions of the United States Supreme Court, can be encapsulated into the following categories:

1. that there be absolute necessity of deciding a case; 2. that rules of constitutional law shall be formulated only as required by the facts of the case; 3. that judgment may not be sustained on some other ground; 4. that there be actual injury sustained by the party by reason of the operation of the statute; 5. that the parties are not in estoppel; 6. that the Court upholds the presumption of constitutionality. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



The question of constitutionality of a law will only be passed upon by the Court if it is properly raised and presented in the case and indispensable to the resolution of the case, that is, the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota presented; courts avoid ruling on constitutional questions and are obligated to presume that the acts of Congress are valid, unless the contrary is clearly shown. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



Judgments or orders 
- Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution provides that ―no decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based,‖ and that ―no petition for review or motion for reconsideration of a decision of the court shall be refused due course or denied without stating the basis therefor.‖ (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



Rule 36, Section 1 of the Rules of Court embraced this constitutional mandate, directing that ―a judgment or final order determining the merits of the case shall be in writing personally and directly prepared by the judge, stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based, signed by him, and filed with the clerk of the court.‖ (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



Power of judicial review 
- A court's power of judicial review, which includes the power to "declare executive and legislative acts void if violative of the Constitution," is provided in Article VIII, Section 1 of the Constitution; judicial review of the constitutionality of a statute is not limited to an action "for declaratory relief" and may be sought through any of the cognizable actions by courts of law; however, for the court to exercise its power of judicial review, the constitutional issue "(a) must be properly raised and presented in the case, and (b) its resolution is necessary to a determination of the case, i.e., the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota presented." (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)

A question is ripe for adjudication when the act being challenged has had a direct adverse effect on the individual challenging it; for a case to be considered ripe for adjudication, it is a prerequisite that something has then been accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into the picture, and the petitioner must allege the existence of an immediate or threatened injury to himself as a result of the challenged action. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



An actual case or controversy means an existing case or controversy that is appropriate or ripe for determination, not conjectural or anticipatory, lest the decision of the court would amount to an advisory opinion. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



For a court to exercise this power, certain requirements must first be met, namely:

(1) an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power; (2) person challenging the act must have "standing" to challenge; he must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement; (3) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity; and (4) the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota of the case. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



The Court, through the years, has allowed litigants to seek from it direct relief upon allegation of "serious and important reasons"; Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections summarized these circumstances in this wise: (1) when there are genuine issues of constitutionality that must be addressed at the most immediate time; (2) when the issues involved are of transcendental importance;

(3) cases of first impression; (4) the constitutional issues raised are better decided by the Court; (5) exigency in certain situations; (6) the filed petition reviews the act of a constitutional organ; (7) when petitioners rightly claim that they had no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law that could free them from the injurious effects of respondents' acts in violation of their right to freedom of expression; and (8) the petition includes questions that are "dictated by public welfare and the advancement of public policy, or demanded by the broader interest of justice, or the orders complained of were found to be patent nullities, or the appeal was considered as clearly an inappropriate remedy." (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



The mere passage of the law does not per se absolutely determine the justiciability of a particular case attacking the law's constitutionality. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)

The power of judicial review is the power of the Courts to test the validity of executive and legislative acts for their conformity with the Constitution; through such power, the judiciary enforces and upholds the supremacy of the Constitution. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



The power of judicial review, like all powers granted by the Constitution, is subject to certain limitations; petitioner must comply with all the requisites for judicial review before this Court may take cognizance of the case; the requisites are: (1) there must be an actual case or controversy calling for the exercise of judicial power; (2) the person challenging the act must have the standing to question the validity of the subject act or issuance; otherwise stated, he must have a personal and substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement; (3) the question of constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and (4) the issue of constitutionality must be the very lis mota of the case. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



The rule is that courts do not sit to adjudicate mere academic questions to satisfy scholarly interest, however intellectually challenging; the controversy must be justiciable, definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



When a law is questioned before the Supreme Court, the presumption is in favor of its constitutionality and the burden is squarely on the shoulders of the one alleging unconstitutionality to prove invalidity beyond reasonable doubt by negating all possible bases for the constitutionality of a statute. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



#### JURISDICTION



Aspects of 
- In adjudication, the concept of jurisdiction has several aspects, namely: (a) jurisdiction over the subject matter; (b) jurisdiction over the parties; (c) jurisdiction over the issues of the case; and (d) in cases involving property, jurisdiction over the res or the thing which is the subject of the litigation; a court must also acquire jurisdiction over the remedy in order for it to exercise its powers validly and with binding effect. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Concept of 
- Certain statutes confer jurisdiction, power, or authority while others provide for the procedure by which that power or authority is projected into judgment the first deals with the powers of the court in the real and substantive sense while the other class with the procedure by which such powers are put into action; as in this case, special proceedings are creatures of statutes (or constitutional provisions in the case of extraordinary writs like habeas corpus) that do both confer

jurisdiction on specific courts while providing for a specific procedure to be followed in order for the resulting judgment to be valid. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Jurisdiction is the basic foundation of judicial proceedings; it is simply defined as the power and authority conferred by the Constitution or statute of a court to hear and decide a case; without jurisdiction, a judgment rendered by a court is null and void and may be attacked anytime; a void judgment is no judgment at all it can neither be the source of any right nor the creator of any obligation; all acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Time and again, the Court has held that a judgment rendered by a court without jurisdiction is null and void, creates no rights, and produces no effect; it may be attacked anytime since a void judgment for want of jurisdiction is no judgment at all; all acts performed pursuant to it and all claims emanating from it have no legal effect. (Fil-Agro Rural Bank, Inc., through the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC), as Liquidator vs. Villaseñor, Jr., G.R. 226761, July 28, 2020)



Equity of jurisdiction 
- Equity is the principle by which substantial justice may be attained in cases where the prescribed or customary forms of ordinary law are inadequate; in relation to the concept of equity, equity jurisdiction aims to provide complete justice in cases where a court of law is unable to adapt its judgments to the special circumstances of a case because of a resulting legal inflexibility when the law is applied to a given situation. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Jurisdiction over the subject matter 
- Jurisdiction is defined as the power and authority of a court to hear, try, and decide a case; in order that the court may have the power to adjudicate or dispose of the case on the merits, it must acquire, among others, jurisdiction over the subject matter; thus, when a court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the only power it has is to dismiss the action. (Cruz, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 238640, July 1, 2020)



Jurisdiction over the subject matter, is conferred by law and is determined by the allegations in the complaint. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



Jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint; this cannot be acquired by waiver or enlarged by the omission or consent of the parties; lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter can be raised at any time, even on appeal, and the Court may consider the same motu proprio. (Cruz, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 238640, July 1, 2020)



#### LABOR CODE



Amended Rules on Employees Compensation (AREC) 
- The Labor Code and the Amended Rules on Employees Compensation (AREC) provide that the seafarer is declared to be on temporary total disability during the 120-day period within which the seafarer is unable to work; however, a temporary total disability lasting continuously for more than 120 days, except as otherwise provided in the Rules, is considered as a total and permanent disability; the exception referred to above, as explained in Talaroc v. Arpaphil Shipping Corporation, pertains to a situation when the sickness ―still requires medical attendance beyond the 120 days but not to exceed 240 days‖ in which case the temporary total disability period is extended up to maximum of 240 days. (Martinez vs. OSG Ship Management Manila, Inc. (Substituted by Pacific Ocean Manning, Inc.), et al., G.R. 237373, July 29, 2020)



#### LABOR RELATIONS



Appeal by the employer from a judgment involving monetary award 
- An employee of an employer who is undergoing insolvency proceedings has many layers of protection starting from being allowed to prosecute his claim, registering a contingent claim before the insolvency court, and finally, enjoying a preference in case the assets of the corporation are ordered liquidated to pay for its debts. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



Article 110, in fact, can only be enforced in liquidation proceedings as held in Development Bank of the Philippines v. Secretary of Labor: In this jurisdiction, bankruptcy, insolvency and general judicial liquidation proceedings provide the only proper venue for the enforcement of a creditor's preferential right such as that established in Article 110 of the Labor Code; what Article 110 means in the context of an insolvent employer is "that during bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceedings involving the existing properties of the employer, the employees have the advantage of having their unpaid wages satisfied ahead of certain claims which may be proved therein." (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



As the Court held in Viron Garments Manufacturing, Co., Inc. v. NLRC, the mandatory nature of the bond "is clearly limned in the provision that an appeal by the employer may be perfected 'only upon the posting of a cash or surety bond'; the word 'only' makes it perfectly clear, that the lawmakers intended the posting of a cash or surety bond by the employer to be the exclusive means by which an employer's appeal may be perfected"; as against this rule, the Court has recognized exceptional circumstances where it relaxed the requirement for an appeal bond. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)

Assuming the insolvent corporation undergoes liquidation, the measure of protection given to employees is stated in Article 110 of the Labor Code, which provides for preference for unpaid wages and monetary claims even before the payment of claims of the government and other creditors. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



Following Article 217 of the Labor Code, and given the LA's and NLRC's exclusive and original jurisdiction to rule on money claims of an employee, such case may only be filed and ruled upon by the LA and NLRC; however, when an employer is undergoing insolvency proceedings, Article 217 of the Labor Code has to be read together with Section 60 of the Insolvency Law which states that a creditor may be allowed to proceed with the suit to ascertain the amount due to it but the execution of which shall be stayed; during the pendency of the insolvency proceedings, the measure of protection for the employee is to have the claim considered as a contingent claim before the insolvent court following Section 55 of the Insolvency Act. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



This Court has liberally applied the NLRC Rules and the Labor Code provisions on the posting of an appeal bond in exceptional cases; in Your Bus Lines v. NLRC, the Court excused the appellant's failure to post a bond, because it relied on the notice of the decision; while the notice enumerated all the other requirements for perfecting an appeal, it did not include a bond in the list; in Blancaflor v. NLRC, the failure of the appellant therein to post a bond was partly caused by the labor arbiter's failure to state the exact amount of monetary award due, which would have been the basis of the amount of the bond to be posted. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



To determine whether to allow a liberal application of the rule on bonds, it is crucial to understand, especially in this case, whether respondent stands to lose the security provided by the appeal bond as the purpose of the appeal bond, as held in Viron, is to ensure that when the workers prevail, they will receive the money judgment in their favor: the requirement that the employer post a cash or surety bond to perfect its/his appeal is apparently intended to assure the workers that if they prevail in the case, they will receive the money judgment in their favor upon the dismissal of the employer's appeal. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



While the court, when it finds that a lower court or quasi-judicial body is in error, may simply and conveniently nullify the challenged decision, resolution or order and remand the case thereto for further appropriate action, it is well within the conscientious exercise of its broad review powers to refrain from doing so and instead choose to render judgment on the merits when all material facts have been duly laid before it as would buttress its ultimate conclusion, in the public interest and for the expeditious administration of justice, such as where the ends of justice

would not be subserved by the remand of the case. (Karj Global Marketing Network, Inc. vs. Mara, G.R. 190654, July 28, 2020)



Employer-employee relationship 
- An independent contractor "enjoys independence and freedom from the control and supervision of his principal" as opposed to an employee who is "subject to the employer's power to control the means and methods by which the employee's work is to be performed and accomplished"; jurisprudence has recognized another kind of independent contractor: individuals with unique skills and talents that set them apart from ordinary employees; there is no trilateral relationship in this case because the independent contractor himself or herself performs the work for the principal; in other words, the relationship is bilateral. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



In Begino v. ABS-CBN: To determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship, case law has consistently applied the four-fold test, to wit: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages; (c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the employer's power to control the employee on the means and methods by which the work is accomplished. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



In determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, this Court has time and again applied the "four-fold test" which has the following elements, to wit: (a) the selection and engagement of the employee; (b) the payment of wages;

(c) the power to discipline and dismiss; and (d) the employer's power to control the employee with respect to the means and methods by which the work is to be accomplished. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



In Dy Keh Beng v. international Labor and Marine Union of the Philippines, this Court held that an employer's power of control, particularly over personnel working under the employer, is deemed inferred, more so when said personnel are working at the employer's establishment. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



Mode of computing compensation is not the decisive factor in ascertaining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, for what matters is that the employee received compensation from the employer for the services that he or she rendered; disengagement in the context of an employer-employee relationship amounts to dismissal. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



Petitioners were employees of the respondent, not independent contractors, as it was not shown they were hired because of their unique skills and talents, and the sheer modesty of the remuneration rendered to the petitioners as camera operators undermines the assertion that there was something particularly unique about their

status, talents, or skills. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



The control test calls merely for the existence of the right to control the manner of doing the work and not the actual exercise of the right. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



While it has been held that no particular form of evidence is required to prove employer-employee relationship, or that any competent and relevant evidence to prove the relationship may be admitted, this Court believes that a finding of such relationship must still rest on substantial evidence, or "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.‖ (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



Illegal dismissal 
- The burden to prove that a dismissal was anchored on a just or authorized cause rests on the employer, and the failure of the employer to discharge this burden leads to no other conclusion than that a dismissal was illegal; illegally dismissed employees are entitled to reinstatement to their positions with full backwages computed from the time of dismissal up to the time of actual reinstatement; award of attorney‘s fees, proper. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



Reinstatement 
- An employee who returns to work for the same employer is considered a new hire if prior employment was validly terminated, either voluntarily or under any of the just and authorized causes provided in the Labor Code; the reckoning point of the length of service, for purposes of security of tenure, begins on the date the employee was re-hired; however, if an employee returns to work upon an order of reinstatement, he or she is not considered a new hire; because reinstatement presupposes the illegality of the dismissal, the employee is deemed to have remained under the employ of the employer from the date of illegal dismissal to actual reinstatement. (Cuadra, et al. vs. San Miguel Corporation, G.R. 194467, July 13, 2020)



Unfair labor practice 
- Refers to acts that violate the workers' right to organize; there should be no dispute that all the prohibited acts constituting unfair labor practice in essence relate to the workers' right to self-organization; an employer may only be held liable for unfair labor practice if it can be shown that his acts affect in whatever manner the right of his employees to self-organize. (Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc./Tiwi Consolidated Union (APRI-TCU) on Behalf of Fe R. Rubio, et al. vs. Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc., et al., G.R. 237036, July 8, 2020)



#### LABOR STANDARDS



Deduction from the wages 
- Any withholding of an employee‘s wages by an employer may only be allowed in the form of wage deductions under the circumstances
provided in Article 113 of the Labor Code, as well as the Omnibus Rules implementing it; Article 116 of the Labor Code clearly provides that it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, to withhold any amount from the wages of a worker without the worker‘s consent. (Marby Food Ventures Corporation, et al. vs. Dela Cruz, et al., G.R. 244629, July 28, 2020)



It is clearly stated in Article 113 of the Labor Code that no employer, in his own behalf or in behalf of any person, shall make any deduction from the wages of his employees, except in cases where the employer is authorized by law or regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor and Employment, among others. (Marby Food Ventures Corporation, et al. vs. Dela Cruz, et al., G.R. 244629, July 28, 2020)



Field personnel 
- In Auto Bus Transport Systems, Inc. v. Bautista, this Court clarified that the definition of a ―field personnel‖ is not merely concerned with the location where the employee regularly performs his duties but also with the fact that the employee‘s performance is unsupervised by the employer. (Marby Food Ventures Corporation, et al. vs. Dela Cruz, et al., G.R. 244629, July 28, 2020)



We held that field personnel are those who regularly perform their duties away from the principal place of business of the employer and whose actual hours of work in the field cannot be determined with reasonable certainty; to determine whether an employee is a field employee, it is also necessary to confirm if actual hours of work in the field can be determined with reasonable certainty by the employer. (Marby Food Ventures Corporation, et al. vs. Dela Cruz, et al., G.R. 244629, July 28, 2020)



Fixed-term employee 
- The employer must satisfactorily show that it was not in a dominant position of advantage in dealing with its prospective employee, as the court will invalidate fixed-term employment contracts in instances where the employer fails to show that it dealt with the employee in "more or less equal terms‖; sweeping guarantees that the contract was knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon by the parties and that the employer and the employee stood on equal footing, will not suffice. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



We thus laid down indications or criteria under which "term employment" cannot be said to be in circumvention of the law on security of tenure, namely: 1) The fixed period of employment was knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon by the parties without any force, duress, or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstances vitiating his consent; or 2) It satisfactorily appears that the employer and the employee dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance exercised by the former or the latter. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)

Kinds of employees 
- Classifying employment, that is, whether an employee is engaged as a regular, project, seasonal, casual, or fixed-term employee, is "determined by law, regardless of any contract expressing otherwise"; Article 295 of the Labor Code identifies four (4) categories of employees, namely: (1) regular; (2) project;
(3) seasonal; and (4) casual employees; Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora recognized another category: fixed-term employees; fixed-term employment sanctions the possibility of a purely contractual relationship between the employer and the fixed-term employee, provided that certain requisites are met. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



There are four kinds of employees: (1) regular employees or those who have been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer; (2) project employees or those whose employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking, the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee; (3) seasonal employees or those who work or perform services which are seasonal in nature, and the employment is for the duration of the season; and

(4) casual employees or those who are not regular, project, or seasonal employees; jurisprudence later added a fifth kind, the fixed term employee. (Magtibay vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al., G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



Nature of employment 
- Depends on the nature of the activities to be performed by the employee, considering the nature of the employer‘s business, the duration and scope to be done, and in some cases, even the length of time of the performance and its continued existence. (Magtibay vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al., G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



Employment status is determined not by the intent or motivations of the parties but by the nature of the employer‘s business and the duration of the tasks performed by the employees; it does not depend on the will of the employer or the procedure for hiring and the manner of designating the employee; employment status depends on the activities performed by the employee and in some cases, the length of time of the performance and its continued existence. (Espina, et al. vs. Highlands Camp/Rawlings Foundation, Inc., et al., G.R. 220935, July 28, 2020)



Project employees 
- A project employee ―is one whose employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking, the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee‖; the ―services of project-based employees are co-terminous with the project and may be terminated upon the end or completion of the project or a phase thereof for which they were hired.‖ (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)

A project employee‘s work may or may not be usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer; the fact that a project employee‘s work is usually necessary and desirable in the business operation of his/her employer does not necessarily impair the validity of the project employment contract which specifically stipulates a fixed duration of employment. (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



Generally, length of service is a measure to determine whether or not an employee who was initially hired on a temporary basis has attained the status of a regular employee who is entitled to security of tenure; however, such measure may not necessarily be applicable in a construction industry since construction firms cannot guarantee continuous employment of their workers after the completion stage of a project. (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



In Lopez v. Irvine Construction Corp., it was held that ―the principal test for determining whether particular employees are properly characterized as ‗project employees, as distinguished from ‗regular employees,‘ is whether or not the

‗project employees‘ were assigned to carry out a ‗specific project or undertaking,‘ the duration and scope of which were specified at the time the employees were engaged for that project.‖ (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



It is necessary to note that an employer has the burden to prove that the employee is indeed a project employee; ―the employer must establish that (a) the employee was assigned to carry out a particular project or undertaking; and, (b) the duration and scope of which was specific at the time of engagement.‖ (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



Project employment ultimately requires the existence of a project or an undertaking which could either be: (1) a particular job within the regular or usual business of the employer, but which is distinct and separate, and identifiable as such, from the other undertakings of the company; or (2) a particular job not within the regular business of the company; it is not enough that the employee is made aware of the duration and scope of employment at the time of engagement; to rule otherwise would be to allow employers to easily circumvent an employee's right to security of tenure through the convenient artifice of communicating a duration or scope. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



Settled is the rule that ―although the absence of a written contract does not by itself grant regular status to the employees, it is evidence that they were informed of the duration and scope of their work and their status as project employees at the start of their engagement; when no other evidence is offered, the absence of

employment contracts raises a serious question of whether the employees were sufficiently apprised at the start of their employment of their status as project employees.‖ (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



Regular and seasonal employees 
- Under the law, regular employees are those engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual trade or business of the employer; on the other hand, seasonal employees are those whose work or engagement is seasonal in nature and their employment is only for the duration of the season. (Espina, et al. vs. Highlands Camp/Rawlings Foundation, Inc., et al., G.R. 220935, July 28, 2020)



Regular employees 
- Article 295 of the Labor Code "provides for two (2) types of regular employees, namely: (a) those who are engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer (first category); and (b) those who have rendered at least one year of service, whether continuous or broken, with respect to the activity in which they are employed (second category)"; the regular employment status of a person is defined and prescribed by law and not by what the parties say it should be. (Parayday, et al. vs. Shogun Shipping Co., Inc., G.R. 204555, July 6, 2020)



Based on Article 295[280] of the Labor Code and DOLE Department Order No. 19, series of 1993 [D.O. No. 19], an employment is generally deemed regular where: (i) the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, subject to exceptions, such as when one is a fixed, project or seasonal employee; or (ii) the employee has been engaged for at least a year, with respect to the activity he or she is hired, and the employment of such employee remains while such activity exists. (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



Employees‘ services are necessary and directly related to the employer‘s business; they were in fact regular employees. (Espina, et al. vs. Highlands Camp/Rawlings Foundation, Inc., et al., G.R. 220935, July 28, 2020)



In determining regular employment, the Court held that the primary standard is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual trade or business of the employer; the test is whether the former is usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer; the connection can be determined by considering the nature of work performed and its relation to the scheme of the particular business or trade in its entirety. (Magtibay vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al., G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



In determining whether an employment should be considered regular or non- regular, the applicable test is the reasonable connection between the particular

activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the employer; the standard, supplied by the law itself, is whether the work undertaken is necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, a fact that can be assessed by looking into the nature of the services rendered and its relation to the general scheme under which the business or trade is pursued in the usual course. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



The employees are presumed regular employees where the employer failed to discharge its burden to prove that they were project employees; completion of a project is not a valid cause to terminate regular employees. (Engineering & Construction Corporation of Asia [now First Balfour, Incorporated] vs. Palle, et al., G.R. 201247, July 13, 2020)



The law provides for two types of regular employees, namely: (1) those who are engaged to perform activities which are necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer; and (2) those who have rendered at least one year of service, whether continuous or broken, with respect to the activity in which they are employed. (MagtibaY vs. Airtrac Agricultural Corporation and/or Ian Philippe W. Cuyegkeng, President, et al., G.R. 228212, July 8, 2020)



Under Article 295 of the Labor Code, it is clear that the requirement of rendering "at least one (1) year of service," before an employee is deemed to have attained regular status, only applies to casual employees; an employee is regarded a casual employee if he or she was engaged to perform functions which are not necessary and desirable to the usual business and trade of the employer; when one is engaged to perform functions which are necessary and desirable to the usual business and trade of the employer, engagement for a year-long duration is not a controlling consideration. (Paragele, et al. vs. GMA Network, Inc., G.R. 235315, July 13, 2020)



Seasonal employees 
- To be classified as seasonal employees, two (2) elements must concur: (1) they must be performing work or services that are seasonal in nature; and (2) they have been employed for the duration of the season. (Espina, et al. vs. Highlands Camp/Rawlings Foundation, Inc., et al., G.R. 220935, July 28, 2020)



#### LACHES



Principle of 
- Laches is defined as the failure or neglect for an unreasonable or unexplained length of time to do that which by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier warranting a presumption that he has abandoned his right or declined to assert it. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



There is no absolute rule as to what constitutes laches or staleness of demand; each case must be determined according to its particular circumstances; its

application is controlled by equitable considerations; it is the better rule that courts, under the principle of equity, will not be guided or bound strictly by the statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches when to be so, a manifest wrong or injustice would result. (Spouses Hofer vs. Yu, G.R. 231452, July 1, 2020)



#### LAND REGISTRATION



Alienable and disposable public land 
- In Navy Officer's Village Association Inc. v. Republic of the Philippines, we upheld the nullification of petitioner's title over the land situated within the AFP Officers' Village; in that case, the petitioner acquired the land after Proclamation No. 478 declared the area as part of the Veterans Rehabilitation and Medical Training Center; the land reverted to its original classification as non-alienable and non-disposable public land; in contrast, there is no existing issuance which allocated the land within the AFP Officers' Village for the construction of the golf course. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



The empty land, on which the Philippine navy golf course stands, remains part of the alienable and disposable public land of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) officers' village. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



#### LAND TITLES AND DEEDS



Reconstitution 
- Failure to comply with any of the jurisdictional requirements for a petition for reconstitution renders the whole proceedings null and void; liberal construction of the rules does not apply to substantive requirements specifically enumerated by a statute, especially so if matters affecting jurisdiction are involved. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



For the trial court to acquire jurisdiction over the petition for reconstitution, the occupants of the property should be notified of the petition; it is beyond cavil that the requirement of actual notice to the occupants and the owners of the adjoining property under Sections 12 and 13 of R.A. 26 is itself mandatory to vest jurisdiction upon the court in a petition for reconstitution of title and essential in order to allow said court to take the case on its merits. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Reconstitution of title is a special proceeding; being a special proceeding, a petition for reconstitution must allege and prove certain specific jurisdictional facts before a trial court can acquire jurisdiction; R.A. 26, as amended, is the special law which provides for a specific procedure for the reconstitution of Torrens certificates of title lost or destroyed; Sections 2 and 3 thereof provide how original certificates of title and transfer certificates of title shall be respectively reconstituted and from what specific sources successively

enumerated therein such reconstitution shall be made. (Denila vs. Republic, et al.,

G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



The purposes of the stringent and mandatory character of the legal requirement of mailing the notice to the actual occupants of property covered by the certificates of title to be reconstituted are: (a) to safeguard against spurious and unfounded land ownership claims; (b) to apprise all interested parties of the existence of such action; and (c) to give them enough time to intervene in the proceeding. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### LAW OF THE CASE



Principle of 
- In Sps. Sy v. Young, the principle of the law of the case was rationalized, thus: The rationale behind this rule is to enable an appellate court to perform its duties satisfactorily and efficiently, which would be impossible if a question, once considered and decided by it, were to be litigated anew in the same case upon any and every subsequent appeal; without it, there would be endless litigation. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Rene Divinagracia, substituted by his heirs, namely: Tranquilino Rene, et al., G.R. 226650, July 8, 2020)



Law of the case is defined as the opinion delivered on a former appeal; it means that whatever is once irrevocably established, the controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the court. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Rene Divinagracia, substituted by his heirs, namely: Tranquilino Rene, et al., G.R. 226650, July 8, 2020)



The law of the case does not have the finality of res judicata as it applies only to the same case; whereas res judicata forecloses parties or privies in one case by what has been done in another case; in the principle of the law of the case, the rule made by an appellate court cannot be departed from in subsequent proceedings in the same case. (Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Heirs of Rene Divinagracia, substituted by his heirs, namely: Tranquilino Rene, et al., G.R. 226650, July 8, 2020)



#### LEASE



Contract of 
- A lease agreement is void where the same is the result of a pactum commissorium; contracts whose purpose is contrary to law are void and inexistent from the beginning. (Eupena vs. Bobier, G.R. 211078, July 8, 2020)



Consing v. Jamandre, this Court ruled that the stipulation in a lease contract, which authorized the sublessor to take possession of the premises without judicial action, is valid and binding because the stipulation is in the nature of a resolutory condition; Consing teaches that while Article 1673 provides for judicial action to

eject the lessee, it is only required if the lease contract has no special provision granting the cancellation of the lease. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



If the lessee introduces improvements on the leased premises, the law only grants him or her the right to remove these improvements, or be paid 50 percent  of their value in case the lessor decides to retain; because the lessee is deemed to have known the nature of occupation and possession of the premises, he or she is deemed to have introduced the improvements at his or her own risk. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



In Land Bank of the Philippines v. AMS Farming Corporation, this Court explained that a lessee who builds on the leased premises is treated differently from a builder in good faith; unlike a lessee, a builder in good faith believed that he or she owned the land; under Articles 448 and 546 of the Civil Code, the builder in good faith is granted the rights of retention and reimbursement for the necessary and useful expenses spent on the improvements; on the other hand, a lessee is conclusively presumed to know that he or she does not own the land. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



The Civil Code outlines a number of provisions that guide the parties and limit the stipulations that may be agreed upon in the lease contract; it specifies the rights and obligations of the lessor and the lessee, as well as the rules on the payment and ejectment. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



Under Article 1673, "the lessor may judicially eject the lessee" in the following instances: (1) if the period agreed upon has expired; (2) if the lessee fails to pay the price stipulated; (3) if the lessee violates any of the conditions of the contract; and (4) if the thing leased suffered deterioration due to use or service not stipulated. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



Under the Civil Code provisions on lease, when the lease has a definite period, it ceases on the day fixed without need for a demand from the lessor; the lessee, then, shall return the thing leased, as they received it, to the lessor; however, if at the end of the contract, the lessor allows the lessee to enjoy the lease for 15 days, there arises an implied lease and the terms of the original contract are revived; it is presumed by law that the lessor is amenable to its renewal. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



When there is an implied lease, the lease will continue based on the period of payment; for instance, if the lease is paid monthly, the implied lease would only be renewed every month; the implied lease is a lease with a definite period, and it is "terminable at the end of each month upon demand to vacate by the lessor"; on the other hand, if the lessor refuses to renew the lease, it is necessary for him or

her to furnish the lessee with a formal notice to vacate the premises; if the lessee continues to possess the premises against the lessor's will, the lessee would be holding the property illegally and a judicial action may be filed. (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



#### LITIS PENDENTIA


Principle of 
- Litis pendentia "refers to that situation wherein another action is pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, such that the second action becomes unnecessary and vexatious"; the following requisites must concur for litis pendentia to be present: (1) the identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (2) the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for; and (3) the identity of the two (2) cases such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to res judicata in the other. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE



Persons accountable for local government funds 
- Section 340 of the Local Government Code on persons accountable for local government funds provides: SECTION 340. Persons Accountable for Local Government Funds - Any officer of the local government unit whose duty permits or requires the possession or custody of local government funds shall be accountable and responsible for the safekeeping thereof in conformity with the provisions of this Title; other local officers who, though not accountable by the nature of their duties, may likewise be similarly held accountable and responsible for local government funds through their participation in the use or application thereof. (Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al. G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020)



#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 (R.A. 7160)



Application of 
- Sections 61 and 62 of the LGC, as well as Sections 125 and 126 of its Implementing Rules and Regulations or Administrative Order No. 270, provide that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Camarines Sur has jurisdiction over complaints filed against any erring municipal official within its jurisdiction; upon the filing of said complaint, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan shall require the filing of the respondent's verified answer. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



The nature of municipal ordinances or resolutions which require publication is embodied in Sections 59, 188, and 511 of the LGC; a municipal ordinance or resolution which is neither penal in nature nor a tax measure need not be published. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



Real property tax 
- In National Power Corp. v. Province of Quezon, et al., relying on the Court's pronouncement in Testate Estate of Concordia T. Lim v. City of Manila, the Court ruled that contractual assumption of the obligation to pay real property tax, by itself, is insufficient to make one liable for taxes; the contractual assumption of tax liability must be supplemented by an interest that the party assuming the liability had on the property; the person from whom payment is sought must have also acquired the beneficial use of the property taxed. (Provincial Government of Cavite, et al. vs. CQM Management, Inc. [as successor-in-interest of the Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc.], G.R. 248033, July 15, 2020)



National Power Corp. v. Province of Quezon, et al., the Court explained that the liability for taxes generally rests on the owner of the real property at the time the tax accrues as a necessary repercussion of exclusive dominion; however, personal liability for real property taxes may also expressly rest on the entity with the beneficial use of the real property; in either case, the unpaid tax attaches to the property and is chargeable against the taxable person who had actual or beneficial use and possession of it regardless of whether or not he is the owner. (Provincial Government of Cavite, et al. vs. CQM Management, Inc. [as successor-in-interest of the Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc.], G.R. 248033, July 15, 2020)



Section 270 of RA 7160 provides that "the basic real property tax shall be collected within five (5) years from the date they become due," and that "no action for the collection of the tax, whether administrative or judicial, shall be instituted after the expiration of such period." (Provincial Government of Cavite, et al. vs. CQM Management, Inc. [as successor-in-interest of the Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc.], G.R. 248033, July 15, 2020)



#### MALA IN SE AND MALA PROHIBITA


Distinguished 
- An act prohibited by a special law does not automatically make it malum prohibitum; ―when the acts complained of are inherently immoral, they are deemed mala in se, even if they are punished by a special law‖; the bench and bar must rid themselves of the common misconception that all mala in se crimes are found in the Revised Penal Code (RPC), while all mala prohibita crimes are provided by special laws; the better approach to distinguish between mala in se and mala prohibita crimes is the determination of the inherent immorality or vileness of the penalized act. (Cardona vs. People, G.R. 244544, July 6, 2020)



#### MALVERSATION



Commission of 
- The elements of malversation of public funds are: (1) that the offender is a public officer; (2) that he or she had custody or control of funds or property by reason of the duties of his or her office; (3) that those funds or property were
public funds or property for which he [or she] was accountable; and (4) that he or she appropriated, took, misappropriated or consented or, through abandonment or negligence, permitted another person to take them. (Baya vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan (2ND Division), et al. G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020)



#### MIGRANT WORKERS ACT (R. A. NO. 8042)



Application of 
- Section 10 of R.A. 8042, as amended by R.A. 10022 provides that if the recruitment or placement agency is a juridical being, its corporate officers, directors and partners, as the case may be, shall be jointly and solidarily liable with the corporation or partnership for the claims and damages against it. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al., G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



#### MODES OF ACQUIRING OWNERSHIP



Donation 
- Donations of purchase money must follow the formal requirements mandated by law. (Spouses Devisfruto vs. Greenfell, G.R. 227725, July 1, 2020)



#### MODES OF DISCOVERY



Admission by adverse party 
- A request for admission seeks to obtain admissions from the adverse party regarding the genuineness of relevant documents or relevant matters to enable a party to discover the evidence of the adverse side and facilitate an amicable settlement of the case to expedite the trial of the same. (Republic vs. Datuin, et al., G.R. 224076, July 28, 2020)



#### MORTGAGES



Contract of mortgage 
- To be valid, the following essential requisites must be met: first, that the mortgage is constituted to secure the fulfillment of a principal obligation; second, the mortgagor is the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged; and third, the persons constituting the mortgage have the free disposal of their property, and in the absence thereof, that they be legally authorized for the purpose. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



Doctrine of mortgagee in good faith 
- A bank should not necessarily be made liable if it did not investigate or inspect the property, if the circumstances reveal that an investigation would still not yield a discovery of any anomaly, or anything that would arouse suspicion on the mortgaged property. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



A mortgage is deemed valid if the mortgagee relied in good faith on what appears on the face of the certificate of title, even if the mortgagor fraudulently acquired

the title to the property; when an innocent mortgagee who relies upon the correctness of a certificate of title consequently acquires rights over the mortgaged property, the courts cannot disregard such rights. (Parcon- Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



If the certificate of title indicates nothing that will raise concern, and the mortgagee is unaware of any defect in the title or any other problematic circumstance surrounding the property, the mortgagee is not required to further investigate; rationale; the burden of discovery of invalid transactions relating to the property covered by a title appearing regular on its face is shifted from the third party relying on the title to the co-owners or the predecessors of the title holder, as the latter are more intimately knowledgeable about the status of the property and its history. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



When the purchaser or the mortgagee is a bank, a higher standard is imposed before it is considered a mortgagee in good faith, as it cannot simply rely on the face of the certificate of title alone, but must further investigate the property to ensure the genuineness of the title; a bank is considered a mortgagee in good faith if it inspected and investigated the property in accordance with the standards imposed on banks. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



Foreclosure of 
- A mortgagee who is prohibited from acquiring public lands may possess the property for five years after default and for the purpose of foreclosure, but it may not bid or take part in the foreclosure sale and acquisition of the mortgaged properties. (Parcon-Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



The applicable law that governs the foreclosure sale of the real property to the respondent bank is Republic Act No. 4882, not Republic Act No. 10641 which allows a foreign bank to participate in foreclosure sales of real property mortgaged to it and possess it, subject to limitations; the sale to respondent foreign bank of the real property mortgaged to it is invalid, as it cannot bid or take part in any foreclosure sale and acquisition of the property. (Parcon- Song vs. Parcon, joined by her husband Joaquin A. Parcon, et al., G.R. 199582, July 7, 2020)



Requisites 
- Article 2085 of the Civil Code specifies the elements of valid contracts of mortgage: (1) That they be constituted to secure the fulfillment of a principal obligation; (2) That the mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged;
(3) That the persons constituting the mortgage have the free disposal of their property, and in the absence thereof, that they be legally authorized for the purpose. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)

Third-party accommodation mortgagors 
- Third-party or accommodation mortgagors who secure the fulfillment of another's obligation by mortgaging their own properties are not solidarily bound with the principal obligor, for it is only upon the default of the latter that the creditor may have recourse on the third-party or accommodation mortgagors, but the liability of the latter extends only to the amount secured by the mortgages over their properties. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Francisco Vda. De Trinidad, et al., G.R. 237506, July 28, 2020)



#### MOTIONS



Motion for summary judgment 
- A genuine issue means an issue of fact which calls for presentation of evidence as distinguished from an issue which is sham, fictitious, contrived, set up a bad faith, and patently unsubstantial so as not to constitute a genuine issue for trial. (Republic vs. Datuin, et al., G.R. 224076, July 28, 2020)



Summary judgment may be validly rendered when these twin elements are present: (a) there must be no genuine issue as to any material fact, except for the amount of damages; and (b) the party presenting the motion for summary judgment must be entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. (Republic vs. Datuin, et al., G.R. 224076, July 28, 2020)



Three-day notice rule 
- The general rule is that the three (3)-day notice requirement in motions under Sections 4 and 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court is mandatory; when the adverse party had been afforded the opportunity to be heard, and has been indeed heard through the pleadings filed in opposition to the motion, the purpose behind the 3-day notice requirement is deemed realized. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### MURDER



Elements of 
- To successfully prosecute the crime of Murder, the following elements must be established: (1) that a person was killed; (2) that the accused killed him or her; (3) that the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) that the killing is not parricide or infanticide. (People vs. Silvederio III, G.R. 239777, July 8, 2020)



To sustain a conviction for murder, the prosecution must prove the following essential elements, to wit: (1) a person was killed; (2) the accused killed him or her; (3) the killing was attended by any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 248 of the RPC; and (4) the killing does not amount to parricide or infanticide. (People vs. Alcala, et al., G.R. 233319, July 7, 2020)



#### NOTARIES PUBLIC

Duties 
- A notary public exercises duties calling for carefulness and faithfulness; notaries must inform themselves of the facts they certify to; most importantly, they should not take part or allow themselves to be part of illegal transactions. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



A notary public should not notarize a document unless the persons who signed the same are the very same persons who executed and personally appeared before him or her to attest to the contents and truthfulness of the statements therein. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



In the performance of his or her duties, a notary public must observe the highest degree of care in complying with the basic requirements to preserve the public's confidence in the integrity of the notarial system; this is because notarization of a private document converts it into a public instrument making it admissible in court without further proof of its authenticity. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



Notaries public must dutifully abide by the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility; they must avoid committing falsehoods or consent to the doing of any; they must stand as vanguards against any illegal and immoral arrangements in the execution of documents. (Heirs of Odylon Unite Torrices, represented by Sole Heir Miguel B. Torrices vs. Galano, A.C. No. 11870, July 7, 2020)



The conferment of a notarial commission embodies the correlative duty to observe the basic requirements in the performance of notarial duties with utmost care to avoid the erosion of the public's confidence in the integrity of a notarized document. (Heirs of Odylon Unite Torrices, represented by Sole Heir Miguel B. Torrices vs. Galano, A.C. No. 11870, July 7, 2020)



Liability of 
- In the cases of Malvar v. Baleros, Ko v. Uy-Lampasa, Ocampo-Ingcoco v. Yrreverre, Jr., therein respondent lawyers-notaries public were all found guilty of notarizing documents without the presence of the executing parties, and thus, were uniformly meted with the penalties of immediate revocation of their notarial commissions, disqualification from being commissioned as notaries public for a period of two (2) years, and suspension from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months. (De Guzman vs. Venzon, et al., A.C. No. 8559, July 27, 2020)



Notarization of documents 
- Notarization is an act invested with substantive public interest, as it results to the conversion of a private document into a public instrument, thereby making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity; by law, a notarized document is entitled to full faith and credit. (Heirs of Odylon Unite Torrices, represented by Sole Heir Miguel B. Torrices vs. Galano, A.C. No. 11870, July 7, 2020)



#### OBLIGATIONS



Extinguishment of obligations 
- Under Article 1262 of the Civil Code, an obligation to deliver a determinate thing shall be extinguished if it was lost or destroyed without fault and delay on the part of the obligor; if the thing is lost while in the custody of the obligor, the law presumes that the loss was due to the obligor's fault, unless there is proof to the contrary; this presumption lies because the obligor "has the custody and care of the thing can easily explain the circumstances of the loss." (CJH Development Corporation vs. Aniceto, G.R. 224006, July 6, 2020)



#### OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL



Orders and decisions 
- Copies of orders and decisions served on the deputized counsel, acting as an agent or representative of the Solicitor General, are not binding until they are actually received by the latter. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### OMBUDSMAN



Consolidation of cases 
- Administrative and criminal charges filed before the Ombudsman would usually pertain to one incident involving the same set of facts and parties, from which both criminal and administrative liabilities may stem; this gives rise to their consolidation; however, after the Ombudsman renders its consolidated ruling, the aggrieved party is then required to take the appropriate procedural remedies to separately assail the administrative and criminal components of the same. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



As consolidation is a matter for the court to determine post-filing, it does not affect the nature of the procedural recourse taken by the aggrieved party; when the Ombudsman consolidated the criminal and administrative charges against respondents, it deemed it proper to resolve both criminal and administrative aspects in one Joint Resolution because the charges involved common questions of fact or law. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



Consolidation is an act of judicial discretion when several cases are already filed and pending before it; this assumes that the procedural vehicles taken when these remedies are filed in the deciding forum are proper and thus, are to be given due course; Rule 31 of the Rules of Court, which applies suppletorily in cases before the Ombudsman, provides that consolidation involves actions that are already pending before the Court. (Yatco vs. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, et al., G.R. 244775, July 6, 2020)



Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman 
- According to Section 4, Rule II of A.O. 7 entitled "Rules of Procedure of the Office of the Ombudsman,"
supporting witnesses must execute affidavits to substantiate a complaint against a person under preliminary investigation; affidavits are voluntary declarations of fact written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer authorized to administer oaths. (Villa-Ignacio vs. Chua, G.R. 220535, July 8, 2020)



In assessing whether petitioners‘ right to speedy disposition of cases was violated, Cagang dictates that the Court first examine whether the Ombudsman followed the specified time periods for the conduct of the preliminary investigation; if the Ombudsman exceeded the prescribed period, the burden of proof shifts to the State; while the Rules of Procedure of the Ombudsman does not provide a period within which the preliminary investigation should be concluded, the periods provided under Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, finds suppletory application. (Catamco (formerly Nancy C. Perez) vs. Sandiganbayan Sixth Division, et al.,

G.R. Nos. 243560-62, July 28, 2020)



Once the Information has been filed with the Sandiganbayan, action by the OSP on the motion for reconsideration or reinvestigation is no longer a matter of right but a privilege, as the Sandiganbayan has to grant leave to the OSP in order for it to act on the motion for reconsideration or reinvestigation. (People vs. The Honorable Fourth Division, Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 233061-62, July 28, 2020)



Section iii(n) of Administrative Order (A.O.) 16, series of 2003; a person who belongs to the same component unit as any of the parties to the case, regardless of the timeframe that the acts complained of transpired, is disqualified from acting on the complaint or participating in the proceedings. (Villa-Ignacio vs. Chua, G.R. 220535, July 8, 2020)



#### OMNIBUS ELECTION CODE (B.P. NO. 881)



Section 195 
- We rule Section 195 of the OEC to be mala in se; the applicable portion of Section 195 forbids the intentional tearing or defacing of the ballot or the placement of a distinguishing mark; ―marks made by the voter unintentionally do not invalidate the ballot; neither do marks made by some person other than the voter‖; if these innocuous marks do not violate the constitutional duty to secure the secrecy of the ballot and preserve the sanctity and integrity of the electoral process, then We can reasonably conclude that such marking does not constitute an election offense, as in this case. (Cardona vs. People, G.R. 244544, July 6, 2020)



#### OWNERSHIP



Accretion 
- Accretion benefits a riparian owner when the following requisites are present: 1) That the deposit be gradual and imperceptible; 2) That it resulted from the effects of the current of the water; and 3) That the land where accretion takes place is adjacent to the bank of the river. (Republic vs. Tongson, Sr., et al., G.R. 233304, July 28, 2020)



For the findings of the CENRO and the DENR to be conclusive on the courts to establish the fact of accretion, the certifying officer, the land surveyor, or any similarly competent officer of the said agency should have been presented in court to provide the factual bases of their findings. (Republic vs. Tongson, Sr., et al., G.R. 233304, July 28, 2020)



In the absence of evidence that the change in the course of the river was sudden or that it occurred through avulsion, the presumption is that the change was gradual and was caused by alluvium and erosion; there is no question that the foregoing requisites must be sufficiently established by the riparian owners applying for land registration over the additional portion; in the event that the land situated along the riverbank is indeed shown to have increased gradually over time from soil deposits brought by the river‘s current, there arises a disputable presumption that the change was gradual and caused by alluvium. (Republic vs. Tongson, Sr., et al., G.R. 233304, July 28, 2020)



It is likewise settled that ―an accretion does not automatically become registered land just because the lot that receives such accretion is covered by a Torrens Title; ownership of a piece of land is one thing; registration under the Torrens system of ownership is another.‖ (Republic vs. Tongson, Sr., et al., G.R. 233304, July 28, 2020)



#### PARTIES



Death of a party 
- The duty of counsel under Section 16, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court] is two-fold: first, the counsel must inform the court within 30 days after the death of his client of such fact of death; and second, to give the court the names and addresses of the deceased litigant‘s legal representative or representatives; this is the only representation that a counsel can undertake after his client‘s death as the fact of death essentially terminates the lawyer-client relationship that they had with each other. (Siao vs. Atup, A.C. No. 10890, July 1, 2020)



The substitution of a deceased litigant is not automatic as the legal representative or representatives identified by the counsel are required to first appear before the court, which, in turn, will determine who may be allowed to be substituted for the deceased party. (Siao vs. Atup, A.C. No. 10890, July 1, 2020)



Indispensable parties 
- Settled is the rule that the non-joinder of indispensable parties is not a ground for the dismissal of an action; the remedy, instead, is to implead the non-party claimed to be indispensable; parties may be added by order of the court on motion of the party or on its own initiative at any stage of the action and/or at such times as are just; if the plaintiff refuses to implead an indispensable party despite the order of the court, then the court may dismiss the complaint for the plaintiff's failure to comply with a lawful court order. (Brig. General Collao, Jr.,
in his capacity as Commanding General, Headquarters and Headquarters Support Group, Philippine Army vs. Albania, G.R. 228905, July 15, 2020)



Representatives as parties 
- Where the action is allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a representative or someone acting in a fiduciary capacity, the beneficiary shall be included in the title of the case and shall be deemed to be the real party in interest. (Brig. General Collao, Jr., in his capacity as Commanding General, Headquarters and Headquarters Support Group, Philippine Army vs. Albania, G.R. 228905, July 15, 2020)



#### PHILIPPINE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY (PDEA)



Duties 
- It was thus tasked with implementing the "national drug control strategy" formulated by the Dangerous Drugs Board; with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency now the primary agency to enforce and implement the law, Section 68 abolished the offices with similar anti-drug operations in the National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine National Police, and Bureau of Customs; their functions were transferred to the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency as the lead agency, with them only providing support or detail services. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



Republic Act No. 9165 created the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency to be primarily responsible for "the efficient and effective law enforcement of all the provisions on any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical as provided in this Act." (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency takes the lead in narcotics-related cases; an agency such as the National Bureau of Investigation, with its mandate of investigating crimes and other offenses, generally assists in the case build-up leading to an arrest or provides reinforcement during an operation planned and initiated by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



#### PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION-STANDARD EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT (POEA-SEC)



Application of 
- The Court is clear that the POEA-SEC is imbued with public interest; its provisions must be construed fairly, reasonably, and liberally in favor of the seafarer in the pursuit of his employment on board ocean-going vessels. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



The seafarer‘s repatriation cannot be considered as voluntary, where he was sexually harassed during the course of his employment on board the sea vessel;

hence, he is entitled to his salary for the unexpired portion of his contract. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



Compensable injury or illness 
- As to diseases not listed as occupational diseases, no legal presumption of compensability is accorded in favor of the seafarer, and as such, the claimant-seafarer bears the burden of proving the positive proposition that there is a reasonable causal connection between his illness and the work for which he has been contracted. (Razonable, Jr. vs. Torm Shipping Philippines, Inc. et al., G.R. 241620, July 7, 2020)



―It is enough that the work has contributed, even in a small degree, to the development of the disease [illness] since strict proof of causation is not required; only reasonable proof of work-connection and not direct causal relation is required to establish compensability." (Macahilas vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 237130, July 1, 2020)



Section 20(A) of the POEA-SEC provides two elements that must concur for an illness to be compensable: (1) the injury or illness must be work-related; and (2) the work-related injury or illness must have existed during the term of the seafarer's employment contract. (Macahilas vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 237130, July 1, 2020)



Construction 
- Being faced with two interpretations as to the status of the overseas worker‘s employment, the court ruled in favor of the worker‘s insurance policy coverage in light of the Labor Code provision that in case of doubt, all labor contracts shall be construed in favor of the safety and decent living of the laborer; hence, respondents are entitled to the insurance benefit of an agency-hired worker, who suffered a natural death. (Eastern Overseas Employment Center, Inc., et al. vs. Heirs of the Deceased Nomer P. Odulio, represented by his wife, May Imbag Odulio, G.R. 240950, July 29, 2020)



The Court is clear that the POEA-SEC is imbued with public interest; its provisions must be construed fairly, reasonably, and liberally in favor of the seafarer in the pursuit of his employment on board ocean-going vessels. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



The seafarer‘s repatriation cannot be considered as voluntary, where he was sexually harassed during the course of his employment on board the sea vessel; hence, he is entitled to his salary for the unexpired portion of his contract. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



3-Day Mandatory Reportorial Requirement 
- A seafarer claiming disability benefits is required to submit himself to a post-employment medical examination by a company-designated physician within three (3) working days from repatriation, and non-compliance thereof results in the forfeiture of the seafarer's claim for
disability benefits; rationale; exceptions. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



Ebuenga v. Southfield Agencies explained the rationale for the 3-day reportorial requirement: The 3-day mandatory reporting requirement must be strictly observed since within 3 days from repatriation, it would be fairly manageable for the physician to identify whether the disease was contracted during the term of his employment or that his working conditions increased the risk of contracting the ailment. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



Petitioner‘s non-compliance with the three-day reportorial requirement is justified, as his mental faculties have hindered him from doing so because of trauma inflicted on him caused by the incidents of sexual harassment at the hands of chief officer while on board the sea vessel. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



Death compensation 
- Case law instructs that "the clear intent of the law is that the employer should be relieved of the obligation of directly paying his employees compensation for work-connected illness or injury on the theory that this is part of the cost of production or business activity; and that no longer would there be need for adversarial proceedings between an employer and his employee in which there were specific legal presumptions operating in favor of the employee and statutorily specified defenses available to an employer.‖ (The Heirs of Reynaldo A. Andag, namely Veneranda B. Andag, et al. vs. DMC Construction Equipment Resources Inc., et al., G.R. 244361, July 13, 2020)



Disability benefits 
- A reading of the three kinds of liabilities under Section 20(B) of the POEA-SEC means that the POEA-SEC intended to make the employer liable for (1) the seafarer's sickness allowance equivalent to his basic wage in addition to the medical treatment that they must provide the seafarer with at their cost; and (2) seafarer's permanent total or partial disability as finally determined by the company-designated physician. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



As consistently held by the Court, at most, petitioner's general statements as to whether his illnesses are work-related and suffered during the term of his contract, surmise mere possibilities, but definitely not the lenient probability required by law to be entitled to disability compensation; the probability of work- connection must at least be anchored on credible information and not merely on uncorroborated self-serving allegations as bare allegations do not suffice to discharge the required quantum of proof of compensability. (Razonable, Jr. vs. Torm Shipping Philippines, Inc. et al., G.R. 241620, July 7, 2020)



Claimants for disability benefits must first discharge the burden of proving with substantial evidence that their ailment was acquired and/or aggravated during the term of their contract; they must show that they experienced health problems

while at sea, the circumstances under which they developed the illness, as well as the symptoms associated by it. (Razonable, Jr. vs. Torm Shipping Philippines, Inc. et al., G.R. 241620, July 7, 2020)



Section 20(B)(6) of the POEA-SEC mandates the employer to pay the seafarer disability benefits for his permanent total or partial disability caused by the work- related illness or injury once there is already a finding of permanent total or partial disability within the 120-day period or the 240-day period; permanent disability essentially means a permanent reduction of the earning power of a seafarer to perform future sea or on board duties and permanent disability benefits serve as a means to alleviate the seafarer's financial condition on account of the level of injury or illness he incurred or contracted. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



Section 20 (E) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract states that "a seafarer who knowingly conceals a pre-existing illness or condition" is disqualified from claiming compensation and benefits; as jurisprudence has settled, this examination is not exploratory in nature and employers are not burdened to discover any and all pre-existing medical condition of the seafarer during its conduct; pre-employment medical examinations are only summary examinations; they only determine whether seafarers are fit to work and does not reflect a comprehensive, in-depth description of the health of an applicant; this is precisely why Section 20 (E) mandates the seafarer to disclose his or her medical history during the pre-employment medical examination. (Clemente vs. Status Maritime Corporation, et al., G.R. 238933, July 1, 2020)



The disability benefits granted to the seafarer are not entirely dependent on the number of treatment lapsed days, but also require that the company-designated physician makes a timely, final and definitive determination of the fitness of a seafarer to sea duty subject to the periods prescribed by law. (Macahilas vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 237130, July 1, 2020)



The existence and due execution of the POEA-SEC does not mean that the seafarers waive their rights to file claims on the basis of substantive law; seafarers who suffer from occupational hazards are not constrained to contractual breach as cause of action in claiming compensation, but may seek damages based on tortious violations by their employers. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



The seafarer‘s medical condition is deemed total and permanent where the employer fails to observe the mandatory period for issuance of a definitive assessment. (Macahilas vs. BSM Crew Service Centre Phils., Inc., et al., G.R. 237130, July 1, 2020)



This Court is precluded from awarding disability benefits, not because of his non- compliance with the 3-day reportorial requirement, but because there is barely any

evidence to support the claim for disability benefits. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



We have held, time and again, that a PEME cannot be relied upon to reflect a seafarer's true state of health since it is not exploratory and may just disclose enough for employers to decide whether a seafarer is fit for overseas employment. (Razonable, Jr. vs. Torm Shipping Philippines, Inc. et al., G.R. 241620, July 7, 2020)



When there is no post-employment medical examination by a company- designated physician, the evaluation of the seafarer‘s chosen physician is considered by law as binding between the parties.



Incompetence or inefficiency 
- Incompetence or inefficiency as a ground for dismissal contemplates the failure to attain work goals or work quotas, either by failing to complete the same within the allotted reasonable period, or by producing unsatisfactory results. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al., G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



Monetary awards 
- An illegally dismissed seafarer is entitled to the full reimbursement of his placement fee with 12 percent  interest per annum. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al., G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



Prevailing jurisprudence provides that in cases where the employment contract of the illegally dismissed seafarer is for less than a year, said respondent should be paid his salaries for the unexpired portion of his employment contract; this amount includes all the seafarer's monthly vacation leave pay and other bonuses which are expressly provided and guaranteed in his employment contract as part of his monthly salary and benefit package. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al.,

G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



Work-related injuries 
- It is not required that an employee must be in perfect health when he contracted the illness to be able to recover disability compensation; it is equally true, that while the employer is not the insurer of the health of the employees, once he takes the employees as he finds them, then he already assumes the risk of liability. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



The "work-related injury," under the 2000 POEA-SEC, is defined as "injury(ies)" resulting in disability or death arising out of and in the course of employment; "work-related illness" is defined as "any sickness resulting to disability or death as a result of an occupational disease listed under Section 32-A of this contract with the conditions set therein satisfied," to wit: 1. The seafarer's work must

involve the risks described herein; 2. The disease was contracted as a result of the seafarer's exposure to the described risks; 3. The disease was contracted within a period of exposure and under such other factors necessary to contract it; and 4. There was no notorious negligence on the part of the seafarer. (Intercrew Shipping Agency, Inc., et al. vs. Calantoc, G.R. 239299, July 8, 2020)



#### PLEADINGS



Filing and service of papers and processess 
- Applying Section 3, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, the date of mailing shall be considered as the date of filing when a pleading is filed by registered mail; it does not matter when the court actually receives the mailed pleading. (Spouses Cordero vs. Octaviano, G.R. 241385, July 7, 2020)



Rule 13, Section 2 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure defines service as "the act of providing a party with a copy of the pleading or paper concerned"; it further stipulates that, unless otherwise ordered, service upon a party's counsel effectively works as service upon the actual party. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Rule 13, Section 11 expresses a preference for personal service: "whenever practicable, the service and filing of pleadings and other papers shall be done personally"; Rule 13, Section 6 specifies how personal service is done; when resorted to, service by mail or substituted service "must be accompanied by a written explanation why the service or filing was not done personally"; this requirement applies "except with respect to papers emanating from the court." (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Service by mail is preferably done through registered mail; service through registered mail is done "by depositing the copy in the post office in a sealed envelope, plainly addressed to the party or his counsel at his office, if known, otherwise at his residence, if known, with postage fully prepaid, and with instructions to the postmaster to return the mail to the sender after ten (10) days if undelivered. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Service by ordinary mail may be resorted to only "if no registry service is available in the locality of either the sender or the addressee"; Rule 13, Section 10 provides standards for determining when personal service and service by mail, whether by registered mail or ordinary mail are deemed complete: SECTION 10. Completeness of service. 
- Personal service is complete upon actual delivery. Service by ordinary mail is complete upon the expiration of ten (10) days after mailing, unless the court otherwise provides. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Service by registered mail is complete upon actual receipt by the addressee, or after five (5) days from the date he received the first notice of the postmaster,

whichever date is earlier; registered mail is then complete upon actual receipt or five (5) days after the postmaster's initial notice; an addressee is given only a limited period to act on a notice as "the purpose is to place the date of receipt of pleadings, judgments and processes beyond the power of the party being served to determine at his pleasure." (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Service by registered mail is complete when it is delivered to the recipient‘s address and received by a person of sufficient discretion to receive it; receipt by the counsel‘s driver of the trial court‘s order, is deemed receipt by the counsel, where there are evidence that the driver had long been authorized by the counsel to receive papers and processes on his behalf. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Service upon the parties' counsels of record is tantamount to service upon the parties themselves, but service upon the parties themselves is not considered service upon their lawyers; the reason is simple, the parties, generally, have no formal education or knowledge of the rules of procedure, specifically, the mechanics of an appeal or availment of legal remedies; thus, they may also be unaware of the rights and duties of a litigant relative to the receipt of a decision. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Under Rule 13, Section 5, service may either be personal or by mail, however, should personal service or service by mail be unavailable, service may be made through substituted service. (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



When a party is represented by counsel, "notices of all kinds, including motions, pleadings, and orders must be served on said counsel and notice to him is notice to client." (Abutin vs. San Juan, G.R. 247345, July 6, 2020)



Relief prayed for 
- A court cannot grant monetary awards on its own initiative where the complainant did not allege and pray for them; changing the theory of the case in the middle of the proceedings is against the rules of fair play and justice. (Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. and/or Interorient Maritime, et al. vs. Hechanova, G.R. 246960, July 28, 2020)



In Bucal v. Bucal, "It is well-settled that courts cannot grant a relief not prayed for in the pleadings or in excess of what is being sought by a party to a case; the rationale for the rule was explained in Development Bank of the Philippines [DBP] v. Teston," viz.: Due process considerations justify this requirement; it is improper to enter an order which exceeds the scope of relief sought by the pleadings, absent notice which affords the opposing party an opportunity to be heard with respect to the proposed relief; the fundamental purpose of the requirement that allegations of a complaint must provide the measure of recovery is to prevent surprise to the defendant. (Interorient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. and/or Interorient Maritime, et al. vs. Hechanova, G.R. 246960, July 28, 2020)



#### PLUNDER ACT (R.A. 7080)



Elements 
- The crime of Plunder, as culled from the law itself (i.e., R.A. 7080), has the following elements: (a) that the offender is a public officer, who acts by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons; (b) that he amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts described in Section 1 (d); and (c) that the aggregate amount or total value of the ill-gotten wealth amassed, accumulated, or acquired is at least P50 Million Pesos. (Sombero, Jr. vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. Nos. 237888 & 237904, July 28, 2020)



#### POSSESSION



Right to possession 
- The owner of real property has the right to enjoy and dispose of a thing, and to file an action against the holder and possessor of the same in order to recover it; this stems from the fact that the right to possession is an attribute of ownership; however, ownership by itself, does not grant the owner an unbridled authority to wrest possession from the lawful occupant. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



To recover possession, the owner must avail of the proper judicial remedy and satisfy all the conditions necessary for the chosen action to prosper; these remedies can be an accion reivindicatoria, action publiciana, or accion interdictal. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



#### PRESCRIPTION



Prescription of actions 
- Following the principles of subrogation, the insurer only steps into the shoes of the insured and therefore, for purposes of prescription, inherits only the remaining period within which the insured may file an action against the wrongdoer; to be sure, the prescriptive period of the action that the insured may file against the wrongdoer begins at the time that the tort was committed and the loss/injury occurred against the insured; the indemnification of the insured by the insurer only allows it to be subrogated to the former's rights, and does not create a new reckoning point for the cause of action that the insured originally has against the wrongdoer. (Filcon Ready Mixed, Inc., et al. vs. UCPB General Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. 229877, July 15, 2020)



In Henson, the Court came up with guidelines relative to the application of Vector and its Decision vis-a-vis the prescriptive period in cases where the insurer is subrogated to the rights of the insured against the wrongdoer based on a quasi-delict. (Filcon Ready Mixed, Inc., et al. vs. UCPB General Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. 229877, July 15, 2020)



Pursuant to Article 1155 of the Civil Code, respondent's demand letter and petitioners' receipt thereof had the effect of interrupting the four (4)-year prescriptive period and gave respondent a whole fresh period of four (4) years from petitioners' receipt of the demand letter within which to file the action for sum of money. (Filcon Ready Mixed, Inc., et al. vs. UCPB General Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. 229877, July 15, 2020)



#### PRESUMPTIONS



Conclusive presumptions 
- The lessee is barred from questioning the lessor‘s ownership of the leased premises where there is proof that a lessor-lessee relationship exists; the mere existence of a lease agreement is not enough to prove the presence of a lessor-lessee relationship. (Eupena vs. Bobier, G.R. 211078, July 8, 2020)



Presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties 
- It is a settled rule that in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, credence is given to prosecution witnesses who are police officers for they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary suggesting ill motive on the part of the police officers or deviation from the regular performance of their duties. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



It is important to note that while the police officers are presumed to have regularly performed their duty, the presumption only applies when there is nothing to suggest that the police officers deviated from the standard conduct of official duty required by law; this presumption is inapplicable to the present case because the record is replete with evidence showing the arresting officers‘ failure to strictly comply with the mandatory language of Section 21, Article II of R.A. 9165. (People vs. Manansala, G.R. 228825, July 28, 2020)



The presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty arises only when the records do not indicate any irregularity or flaw in the performance of official duty; applied to dangerous drugs cases, the prosecution cannot rely on the presumption when there is a clear showing that the apprehending officers unjustifiably failed to comply with the requirements laid down in Section 21 of

R.A. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations; in any case, the presumption of regularity cannot be stronger than the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



#### PROPERTY REGISTRATION DECREE (P.D. NO. 1529)



Application of 
- The applicant for registration and confirmation of title has the burden to prove that the land has been classified as alienable and disposable land of
public domain. (Ususan Development Corporation, represented by Atty. Roel A. Pacio vs. Republic, G.R. 209462, July 15, 2020)



#### PUBLIC LAND ACT (C.A. NO. 141)



Homestead grant 
- Section 119 of the Public Land Act gives the homesteader and his or her heirs the right to repurchase the land awarded him or her; the only condition is that the right to repurchase be exercised within five (5) years from conveyance. (Spouses Duadua Sr., substituted by their heirs Gliceria Duadua Tomboc, et al. vs. R.T. Dino Development Corporation represented by its President Rolando T. Dino, et al., G.R. 247816, July 15, 2020)



Section 119 of the Public Land Act is to give the homesteader or patentee every chance to preserve and keep in the family the land that the State has gratuitously given him or her as a reward for his or her labor in cleaning, developing, and cultivating it; the homestead grant was never intended to be used to serve the business interest of corporations or other artificial persons. (Spouses Duadua Sr., substituted by their heirs Gliceria Duadua Tomboc, et al. vs. R.T. Dino Development Corporation represented by its President Rolando T. Dino, et al.,

G.R. 247816, July 15, 2020)



When the law grants a homestead holder of the right to repurchase the land awarded him or her, the State intends that the holder and his or her family keep the land as their home and their source of livelihood at the same time; the State recognizes not only the social and economic value of this small piece of land to the beneficiaries but in fact demands of them to give utmost importance to this grant that is meant precisely to give them quality life, to uphold their dignity, and to even out the gross inequalities in our society. (Spouses Duadua Sr., substituted by their heirs Gliceria Duadua Tomboc, et al. vs. R.T. Dino Development Corporation represented by its President Rolando T. Dino, et al., G.R. 247816, July 15, 2020)



#### PUBLIC OFFICERS



Grave misconduct 
- Corruption, as an element of grave misconduct, consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his station or character to procure some benefit for himself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



Misconduct refers to transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer; the misconduct is grave if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law or to disregard established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence; otherwise, the misconduct is only simple. (Villa-Ignacio vs. Chua, G.R. 220535, July 8, 2020)



Liability of 
- A public officer shall be held liable for the disallowed amounts when there is negligence or bad faith on her part. (Henson vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 230185, July 7, 2020)



Mistakes committed by public officers 
- Not every mistake committed by a public officer is actionable absent any clear showing that it is motivated by malice or gross negligence amounting to bad faith. (Linsangan vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 234260, July 1, 2020)



#### QUALIFIED RAPE



Commission of 
- Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, states that rape is qualified when the victim is under 18 years old, "and the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim"; the victim's minority and relationship with the perpetrator must both be alleged in the Information. (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)



Pursuant to Article 266-B, paragraph 1, the rape is qualified when the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age and the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law-spouse of the parent of the victim. (People vs. AAA, G.R. 248777, July 7, 2020)



Elements 
- The elements of qualified rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman;
(3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under eighteen (18) years of age at the time of the rape; and (5) the offender is a parent (whether legitimate, illegitimate or adopted) or is an ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or is the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020)



(People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



#### QUALIFIED THEFT



Elements 
- The essential elements of qualified theft are as follows: (1) there was a taking of personal property; (2) the said property belongs to another; (3) the taking was done without the consent of the owner; (4) the taking was done with intent to gain; (5) the taking was accomplished without violence or intimidation against person, or force upon things; and (6) the taking was done under any of the circumstances enumerated in Article 310 of the RPC, i.e., with grave abuse of confidence. (Reside vs. People, G.R. 210318, July 28, 2020)



#### QUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCE



Treachery 
- To properly appreciate treachery, two elements must be present: (1) at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to defend himself; and (2) the accused consciously and deliberately adopted the particular means, methods, or forms of attack employed by him. (People vs. Silvederio III, G.R. 239777, July 8, 2020)



Treachery is the direct employment of means, methods, or forms in the execution of the crime against persons which tends directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to the offender arising from the defense which the offended party might make; the essence of treachery is that the attack is deliberate and without warning, done in a swift and unexpected way, affording the hapless, unarmed, and unsuspecting victim no chance to resist or escape. (People vs. Silvederio III, G.R. 239777, July 8, 2020)



#### QUASI-DELICT


Principle of 
- Case law nevertheless clarifies that a claim specifically grounded on the employer's negligence to provide a safe, healthy and workable environment for its employees is no longer a labor issue, but rather, is a case for quasi-delict which is under the jurisdiction of the regular courts. (The Heirs of Reynaldo A. Andag, namely Veneranda B. Andag, et al. vs. DMC Construction Equipment Resources Inc., et al., G.R. 244361, July 13, 2020)



#### RAPE



Commission of 
- A medico-legal report is not indispensable to the prosecution of the rape case, it being merely corroborative in nature. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



A victim‘s failure to resist another person‘s vigorous advances does not equate to consenting to sexual abuse. (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)



Article 266-A(1) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, enumerates the elements of rape by sexual intercourse: Article 266-A. Rape; When and How Committed; rape is committed 1) By a man who shall have carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances: a) Through force, threat, or intimidation; b) When the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; and d) When the offended party is under twelve (12) years of age or is demented, even though none of the circumstances mentioned above be present; 2) By any person who, under any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof, shall commit an act of sexual assault by inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice, or any instrument or object, into the genital or anal orifice of another person. (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)

In any case, survivors of such cruelty in the hands of their relatives or any person for that matter must not be blamed for any action, or lack thereof, that they take when suddenly forced to respond to a threat; people differ in how they address danger; there is no blueprint on how a victim should act when violated; there is no certainty as to how one would react; what is certain, however, is that a person who forces sexual congress on another is a rapist; rapists' acts must never be attributed to their victims. (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)



It is a well-entrenched principle that "the force used in the commission of rape need not be overpowering or absolutely irresistible"; "tenacious resistance against rape is not required; neither is a determined or a persistent physical struggle on the part of the victim necessary"; after all, resistance is not an element of rape. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



To sustain a conviction for rape through sexual intercourse, the prosecution must prove the following elements beyond reasonable doubt: (i) that the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim; and (ii) that said act was accomplished (a) through the use of force or intimidation, or (b) when the victim is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious, or (c) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority, or (d) when the victim is under 12 years of age or is demented. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



Guiding principles in determining the innocence or guilt of accused 
- To determine the innocence or guilt of the accused in rape cases, the courts are guided by three well-entrenched principles: (1) an accusation of rape can be made with facility and while the accusation is difficult to prove, it is even more difficult for the accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) considering that in the nature of things, only two persons are usually involved in the crime of rape, the testimony of the complainant should be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense. (People vs. AAA, G.R. 248777, July 7, 2020)



#### RES JUDICATA


Concept 
- Petitioner's acquittal in the case for violation of Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 9262 is not res judicata on the action for damages under Article 33 of the Civil Code; one of the elements of res judicata is the identity of causes of action, with "cause of action" being the "act or omission by which a party violates a right of another"; while the criminal action and the action for damages arise from the same act or omission, the alleged physical violence committed by petitioner against respondent; these actions violate two (2) different rights of respondent: (1) her right not to be physically harmed by an intimate partner under Republic Act No. 9262; and (2) her right to recover damages for bodily injury under Article 33 of the Civil Code. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)

Res judicata is defined as a matter adjudged; a thing judicially acted upon or decided; a thing or matter settled by judgment; under this rule, a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies, in all later suits and on all points and matters determined in the previous suit. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Elements 
- To invoke res judicata, the elements that should be present are: (a) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (b) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (c) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (d) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



#### REVERSION



Action for 
- Any action for reversion to lands of public domain should be instituted before the proper courts, and any objection to the application or concession may be filed before the proper government administrative offices in observance with the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



#### REVISED ADMINISTRATIVE CODE OF 1917 (ACT NO. 2711)



Section 246 
- Section 246 of the same Code mandates the submission of each month's entries in the notarial register to the Clerk of Court of the First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of the province within the first ten (10) days of the following month. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



#### 2009 REVISED RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT (RRPC)



Appeal 
- Under Section 4, Rule V of the 2009 Revised Rules of Procedure of the Commission on Audit (RRPC), an appeal to the Director must be filed within six
(6) months after receipt of the decision appealed from; however, this must be read in conjunction with Section 3 of Rule VII of the RRPC which is emphatic that an appeal with the Commission Proper should be filed within the time remaining of the six month reglementary period. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



#### REVISED RULES ON ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE (RRACCS)



Issuance of formal charge 
- The Officer-in-Charge (OIC) was not entirely unauthorized to issue and sign the formal charge, as he was presumed to be acting under the cloak of the authority of the Department of Justice and under the
supervision of the commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration. (Venadas vs.

Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



The Officer-in-charge‘s (OIC) lack of discretion in the appointment and discipline of employees, does not render the formal charge which he issued against an employee an absolute nullity, but a defect that is susceptible to waiver and estoppel. (Venadas vs. Bureau of Immigration, G.R. 222471, July 7, 2020)



#### ROBBERY WITH RAPE



Commission of 
- Robbery with Rape is a special complex crime that contemplates a situation where the accused‘s original intent was to take, with intent to gain, personal property belonging to another and rape is committed on the occasion thereof or as an accompanying crime. (People vs. Yumol, G.R. 225600, July 7, 2020)



Elements 
- Intent to gain, or animus lucrandi, as an element of the crime of robbery, is an internal act, hence, presumed from the unlawful taking of things. (People vs. Yumol, G.R. 225600, July 7, 2020)



It requires the following elements: (1) the taking of personal property is committed with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking is characterized by intent to gain or animus lucrandi; and (4) the robbery is accompanied by rape. (People vs. Yumol, G.R. 225600, July 7, 2020)



#### RULES OF PROCEDURE



Computation of time 
- Section 1, Rule 22 of the Rules of Court provides: SECTION 1. How to compute time. 
- In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these Rules, or by order of the court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of performance included. If the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls on a Saturday a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day. (Castañeda, et al. vs. People, G.R. 241729, July 8, 2020)



#### 2017 RULES ON ADMINISTRATIVE CASES IN THE CIVIL SERVICE (2017 RACCS)



Application of 
- Section 50, Rule 10 of the 2017 Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service (2017 RACCS) provides for the classification of offenses; administrative offenses with corresponding penalties are classified into grave, less grave, and light, depending on their gravity or depravity and effects on the government service; Section 50(B)(5), Rule 10 of the 2017 RACCS categorizes Frequent Unauthorized Absences (Habitual Absenteeism) as a grave offense and shall be punishable by suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1)
year for the first offense and dismissal from service for the second offense. (Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness and Undertime in the First Semester of 2017, A.M. No. 2017-11-SC. July 27, 2020)




- Section 53 of the RACCS grants the disciplining authority the discretion to consider mitigating and aggravating circumstances in the imposition of the proper penalty. (Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness and Undertime in the First Semester of 2017, A.M. No. 2017-11-SC. July 27, 2020)



Habitual tardiness 
- Under Section 50(F), Rule 10 of the 2017 RACCS, Habitual Tardiness is considered as a light offense; it is penalized as follows: a. First Offense – Reprimand; b. Second Offense – Suspension for one (1) to thirty (30) days; and c. Third Offense – Dismissal from the service. (Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness and Undertime in the First Semester of 2017, A.M. No. 2017-11-SC. July 27, 2020)


Simple misconduct 
- Under Section 50 (D)(2), Rule 10 of the 2017 RACCS, simple misconduct is categorized as a less grave offense; less grave offenses are punishable by suspension for one (1) month and one (1) day to six (6) months for the first offense and dismissal from the service for the second offense. (Re: Employees Incurring Habitual Tardiness and Undertime in the First Semester of 2017, A.M. No. 2017-11-SC. July 27, 2020)


#### 2004 RULES ON NOTARIAL PRACTICE



Application of 
- Aside from the physical presence of the affiant during the notarization of a document, the Notarial Rules also requires the presentation of a competent evidence of the affiant‘s identity if he or she is not personally known to the notary public; ―competent evidence of identity‖ is defined under Section 12, Rule II of the Notarial Rules. (Leano vs. Salatan, A.C. No. 12551, July 8, 2020)



Competent evidence of identity 
- A CTC cannot be considered competent evidence of identity as it does not bear the photograph and signature of its owner. (Lopez vs. Mata, et al., A.C. No. 9334, July 28, 2020)



Duties 
- A Notary Public is prohibited from performing a notarial act in the absence of the signatories to the instrument; the notarization of a document in the absence of the parties is a breach of duty; this is clear from Rule IV, Section 2(b) of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. (Heirs of Odylon Unite Torrices, represented by Sole Heir Miguel B. Torrices vs. Galano, A.C. No. 11870, July 7, 2020)



The 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice (2004 Notarial Rules) impose on duly- commissioned notaries public the duty and obligation of ensuring the sanctity of notarized documents by, inter alia: (a) performing a notarial act only if the person involved as signatory to the document or instrument is in his/her personal presence at the time of notarization; and (b) requiring the person having said

document or instrument notarized to produce a competent evidence of identity to ensure that he/she is indeed the one who executed the same; the purpose of these requirements is to enable the notary public to verify the genuineness of the signature of the acknowledging party and to ascertain that the document is the party‘s free act and deed. (De Guzman vs. Venzon, et al., A.C. No. 8559, July 27, 2020)



Effect of notarization 
- It is settled that notarization is not an empty, meaningless routinary act, but one invested with substantive public interest; notarization converts a private document into a public document, making it admissible in evidence without further proof of its authenticity; a notarized document is, by law, entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. (De Guzman vs. Venzon, et al., A.C. No. 8559, July 27, 2020)



Notarial certificate 
- Section 5(b), Rule IV of the same Rules provides that a notary public shall not affix his official signature or seal on a notarial certificate that is incomplete; by definition, a notarial certificate pertains to ―the part of, or attachment to, a notarized instrument or document that is completed by the notary public, bears the notary‘s signature and seat, and states the facts attested to by the notary public in a particular notarization as provided for by these Rules.‖ (Leano vs. Salatan, A.C. No. 12551, July 8, 2020)



Notarial register 
- It is settled that ―a notary public is personally accountable for all entries in his notarial register‖; delegation of his notarial function of recording entries in his notarial register to his office clerk is in itself a clear violation of the Notarial Rules, as well as Rule 9.01, Canon 9 of the CPR. (Leano vs. Salatan, A.C. No. 12551, July 8, 2020)



#### SALES



Contract of 
- The elements of a valid contract of sale are: (1) consent or meeting of the minds; (2) determinate subject matter; and (3) price certain in money or its equivalent; absent any of the elements, the sale is fictitious or otherwise void. (Spouses Viovicente vs. Spouses Viovicente, et al., G.R. 219074, July 28, 2020)



#### SANDIGANBAYAN



Jurisdiction 
- Garcia v. Sandiganbayan requires this action from the Sandiganbayan: from the filing of information, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court, which becomes the sole judge on what to do with the case before it; pursuant to said authority, the court takes full authority over the case, including the manner of the conduct of litigation and resort to processes that will ensure the preservation of its jurisdiction. (People vs. The Honorable Fourth Division, Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 233061-62, July 28, 2020)



The jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan is outlined in Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606, as amended by Section 2 of R.A. 10660; prior to its amendment, Section 4 of

P.D. No. 1606 did not set a threshold amount of damage or damages allegedly suffered by the government which would vest the Sandiganbayan with jurisdiction over the offense; the amendment was introduced in R.A. 10660 which took effect on May 5, 2015. (People vs. Bacaltos, G.R. 248701, July 28, 2020)



#### SEARCH WARRANT



Valid search warrant 
- "A search warrant issued must particularly describe the place to be searched and persons or things to be seized in order for it to be valid, otherwise, it is considered as a general warrant which is proscribed by both jurisprudence and the 1987 Constitution"; the particularity of the place described is essential in the issuance of search warrants to avoid the exercise by the enforcing officers of discretion to decide on their own where to search and whom and what to seize. (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



It has been held that the requirement of particularity as to the things to be seized does not require technical accuracy in the description of the property to be seized, and that a search warrant may be said to particularly describe the things to be seized when the description therein is as specific as the circumstances will ordinarily allow it to be described. (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



It is well-entrenched in our jurisprudence that a description of a place to be searched is sufficient if the officer with the warrant can ascertain and identify with reasonable effort the place intended, and distinguish it from other places in the community; a designation that points out the place to be searched to the exclusion of all others, and on inquiry unerringly leads the peace officers to it, satisfies the constitutional requirement of definiteness. (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



The requirements of a valid search warrant are laid down in Article III, Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution and in Rule 126, Section 4 of the Rules Court, viz.: "(1) probable cause is present; (2) such probable cause must be determined personally by the judge; (3) the judge must examine, in writing and under oath or affirmation, the complainant and the witnesses he or she may produce; (4) the applicant and the witnesses testify on the facts personally known to them; and (5) the warrant specifically describes the place to be searched and the things to be seized." (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



The requisite of particularity is related to the probable cause requirement in that, at least under some circumstances, the lack of a more specific description will make it apparent that there has not been a sufficient showing to the court that the

described items are to be found in a particular place. (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



The search warrant did not indicate that the place to be searched contained five rooms which were separately occupied by petitioner and her sibling is inconsequential and does not affect the validity of the warrant. (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



The test of whether the requirement of definiteness or particularity has been met is whether the description of the place to be searched under the warrant is sufficient and descriptive enough to prevent a search of other premises located within the surrounding area or community; a "place" may refer to a single building or structure, or a house or residence. (Diaz vs. People, G.R. 213875, July 15, 2020)



#### SEARCHES AND SEIZURES



Constitutionality of 
- The inviolability of a person's right against unreasonable searches and seizures finds its mooring in Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution; the general rule is that a judicial warrant is needed before a search and seizure may be carried out; without it, the search and seizure would violate the Constitution and any evidence gathered from it "shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding." (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



Warrantless arrest 
- For valid warrantless arrests under both Section 5(a) and (b), it is imperative that the arresting officer had personal knowledge of the offense; the primary difference between the two subsections is that with Section 5(a), the arresting officer personally witnessed the crime, while under Section 5(b), the arresting officer had reason to believe that the person to be arrested committed an offense. Either way, the lawful arrest generally precedes or is substantially contemporaneous with the search. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



Warrantless searches and seizures 
- In Manibog v. People, this Court, citing Justice Lucas Bersamin's dissent in Esquillo v. People, cautioned against warrantless searches based on a single suspicious circumstance; it stressed that there should be "more than one seemingly innocent activity, which, taken together, warranted a reasonable inference of criminal activity" for a valid stop and frisk search; for this Court to uphold the validity of a stop and frisk search, the arresting officer must have had personal knowledge of facts that would have aroused a reasonable degree of suspicion of an illicit act. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



The constitutional prohibition only encompasses unreasonable searches and seizures; this Court has recognized several instances of reasonable warrantless searches and seizures: 1. Warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest

recognized under Section 12, Rule 126 of the Rules of Court and by prevailing jurisprudence; 2. Seizure of evidence in "plain view," the elements of which are:

(a) a prior valid intrusion based on the valid warrantless arrest in which the police are legally present in the pursuit of their official duties; (b) the evidence was inadvertently discovered by the police who had the right to be where they are; (c) the evidence must be immediately apparent, and (d) "plain view" justified mere seizure of evidence without further search; 3. Search of a moving vehicle; highly regulated by the government, the vehicle's inherent mobility reduces expectation of privacy especially when its transit in public thoroughfares furnishes a highly reasonable suspicion amounting to probable cause that the occupant committed a criminal activity; 4. Consented warrantless search; 5. Customs search; 6. Stop and Frisk; and 7. Exigent and Emergency Circumstances. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



Warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest and stop and risk search, distinguished

- The exceptions of a warrantless search incidental to a lawful arrest and a "stop and frisk" search are often confused; in Malacat v. Court of Appeals, this Court explained that those two exceptions "differ in terms of the requisite quantum of proof before they may be validly effected and in their allowable scope"; for the first instance to operate, the arrest, as the name suggests, must be established to have been lawful; for an arrest to be deemed lawful, a court of law must have issued a warrant of arrest; otherwise, the arrest must have fallen within the purview of a lawful warrantless arrest in Rule 113, Section 5 of the Rules of Court. (Palencia vs. People, G.R. 219560, July 1, 2020)



#### SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)



Powers 
- In Securities and Exchange Commission v. GMA Network, Inc., the Court likened the SEC's authority to prescribe rates to the rate-fixing power of administrative agencies and held that the only applicable standard to gauge the validity thereof is that the rate prescribed be reasonable, just, and proportionate to the service for which the fee is being collected. (First Philippine Holdings Corporation vs. Securities and Exchange Commission, G.R. 206673, July 28, 2020)



Section 139 of the Corporation Code authorized the SEC to "collect and receive fees as authorized by law or by rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission; B.P. Blg. 68 impliedly repealed the specific fees prescribed under

R.A. 944 and R.A. 3531 for incorporating corporations and other related fees by delegating to the SEC the power to promulgate rules prescribing different rates to be collected. (First Philippine Holdings Corporation vs. Securities and Exchange Commission, G.R. 206673, July 28, 2020)



The SEC, the national government regulatory agency charged with supervision over the corporate sector, has been authorized to promulgate rules and regulations reasonably necessary to enable it to perform its duties and mandates; its power to

prescribe fees, and the reasonableness of the amount, must therefore be read in light of this regulatory function. (First Philippine Holdings Corporation vs. Securities and Exchange Commission, G.R. 206673, July 28, 2020)



#### SEPARATION OF POWERS



Principle of 
- The principle of separation of powers has in the main wisely allocated the respective authority of each department and confined its jurisdiction to such a sphere; there would then be intrusion not allowable under the Constitution if on a matter left to the discretion of a coordinate branch, the judiciary would substitute its own. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



#### SEXUAL HARASSMENT



Commission of 
- We must change the notion that injuries refer to only the physical kind; injuries can come in many forms, physical, emotional, or psychological; it is high-time that we recognize sexual harassment on board vessels as a risk faced by our seafarers; we also cannot disregard the possibility that Toliongco felt shame over what had happened; victims of sexual abuse usually take time before reporting to the proper authorities; more so if they are male as society has made it hard for male victims of sexual harassment to come out and report. (Toliongco vs. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 231748, July 8, 2020)



#### SOCIAL SECURITY ACT OF 2018 (R.A. 11199)



Compulsory coverage of overseas Filipino workers 
- Before a managing head, director or partner is penalized, their association, partnership, corporation or any other institution must first commit a criminal act under R.A. 11199; the officers shall only have criminal liability for their organization's own acts; there is no ipso jure criminal liability of the officers of manning agencies because some other separate entity, such as a foreign principal employer, committed a crime entirely unrelated to such manning agency. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



The manning agencies are mere agents of their principals and they are only treated as employers for the exclusive purpose of enforcing their solidary liability with the foreign principal employer in favor of the seafarers, including claims arising from the Social Security System coverage. (Joint Ship Manning Group, Inc., et al. vs. Social Security System, et al., G.R. 247471, July 7, 2020)



#### SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONE ACT OF 1995 (R.A. 7916), AS AMENDED BY R.A. 8748



Application of 
- Prior concurrence of the local government unit is not required before respondent can avail itself of the exemption under the law; having been registered
with the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), respondent is exempt from the payment of national and local taxes including real property tax on the subject properties. (Provincial Government of Cavite, et al. vs. CQM Management, Inc. [as successor-in-interest of the Philippine Investment One (SPV-AMC), Inc.],

G.R. 248033, July 15, 2020)



#### SPECIAL PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AGAINST CHILD ABUSE, EXPLOITATION AND DISCRIMINATION ACT (R.A. 7610)



Application of 
- Accused-appellant‘s repeated physical, verbal and emotional abuse on the victim, which started when he was young, constitute violations of Section 5
and (i) of R.A. 9262. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020



The Court equally holds that all the elements of Sexual Assault are present in the instant case; contrary to petitioner's argument, it should be noted that the relationship between petitioner and his victim is sufficient for petitioner to exert "influence" upon AAA, in addition to the latter's minority; the foregoing notwithstanding, pursuant to People v. Tulagan, the nomenclature of the crime should be modified to Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC, in relation to Section 5 (b), Article III of R.A. 7610 otherwise known as the Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, considering AAA was only 10 years old when the crime was committed against her. (ABC vs. People, G.R. 241591, July 8, 2020)



Civil liability of the accused 
- Section 31(f) of R.A. 7610 imposes a fine upon the perpetrator, which jurisprudence pegs in the amount of P15,000.00; as to the damages, accused-appellant is ordered to pay the victim civil indemnity, moral damages, and exemplary damages in the amount of P75,000.00 each. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



Lascivious conduct 
- The acts of touching and fondling of CCC's breasts and touching of her vagina undeniably amounted to "lascivious conducts"; there is a need to modify the nomenclature of the crime charged to "Lascivious Conduct under Section 5 (b) of R.A. 7610." (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020



The case of People v. Caoili is instructive on the proper designation of the offense in case lascivious conduct is committed, thus: accordingly, for the guidance of public prosecutors and the courts, the Court takes this opportunity to prescribe the following guidelines in designating or charging the proper offense in case lascivious conduct is committed under Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610, and in determining the imposable penalty: 1. The age of the victim is taken into consideration in designating or charging the offense, and in determining the imposable penalty; 2. If the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the nomenclature of the crime should be "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of

the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. 7610." (People

vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020



Sexual abuse 
- A change in the nomenclature of the offense charged against accused- appellant is in order; in People v. Tulagan, the Court prescribes the guidelines in the proper designation or nomenclature of acts constituting sexual assault and the penalty to be imposed depending on the age of the victim, viz.: Considering the development of the crime of sexual assault from a mere ―crime against chastity‖ in the form of acts of lasciviousness to a ―crime against persons‖ akin to rape. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



In Dimakuta and Caoili, We hold that if the acts constituting sexual assault are committed against a victim under 12 years of age or is demented, the nomenclature of the offense should now be ―Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. 7610‖ and no longer ―Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5

of R.A. 7610,‖ because sexual assault as a form of acts of lasciviousness is no longer covered by Article 336 but by Article 266-A (2) of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



The elements of sexual abuse under Section 5, Article III of RA 7610 are: (1) the accused commits the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other sexual abuse; and (3) the child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



#### STARE DECISIS


Principle of 
- The principle of stare decisis et non quieta movera ("to adhere to precedents and not to unsettle things which are established") is a bar to any attempt to re-litigate the same issue where the same questions relating to the same event have been put forward by parties similarly situated as in a previous case litigated and decided by a competent court. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Federation of Golf Clubs of the Philippines, Inc., G.R. 226449, July 28, 2020)



#### STATE



Immunity from suit 
- The doctrine of state immunity is not absolute; the State may waive its cloak of immunity and the waiver may be made expressly or by implication; the doctrine may be shelved when its stubborn observance will lead to the subversion of the ends of justice. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



The State may not be sued without its consent; this fundamental doctrine stems from the principle that there can be no legal right against the authority which

makes the law on which the right depends. (Philippine Navy Golf Club, Inc., et al. vs. Abaya, et al., G.R. 235619, July 13, 2020)



#### STATUTES



Application of laws 
- "All statutes, including those of local application and private laws, shall be published as a condition for their effectivity"; however, the Court clarified that "interpretative regulations and those merely internal in nature, that is, regulating only the personnel of the administrative agency and not the public" and "letters of instruction issued by administrative superiors relative to guidelines to be followed by their subordinates in the performance of their duties" need not be published. (Villafuerte, Governor of the Province of Camarines Sur, et al. vs. Cordial, Jr., Mayor of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, et al., G.R. 222450, July 7, 2020)



Construction 
- It has been held that if a rigid application of the rules of procedure will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice in light of the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. (Barayuga vs. People, G.R. 248382, July 28, 2020)



The principle of liberal construction of procedural rules has been allowed by this Court in the following cases: (a) where a rigid application will result in manifest failure or miscarriage of justice, especially if a party successfully shows that the alleged defect in the questioned final and executory judgment is not apparent on its face or from the recitals contained therein; (b) where the interest of substantial justice will be served; (c) where the resolution of the motion is addressed solely to the sound and judicious discretion of the court; and (d) where the injustice to the adverse party is not commensurate with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure prescribed; in addition, jurisprudence also teaches us that, aside from matters of life, liberty, honor or property which would warrant the suspension of the Rules of the most mandatory character and an examination and review by the appellate court of the lower courts findings of fact, the other elements that should be considered are the following: (a) the existence of special or compelling circumstances; (b) the merits of the case; (c) a cause not entirely attributable to the fault or negligence of the party favored by the suspension of the rules; (d) a lack of any showing that the review sought is merely frivolous and dilatory; and (e) the other party will not be unjustly prejudiced thereby. (Denila vs. Republic, et al., G.R. 206077, July 15, 2020)



Procedural rules 
- As declared in Alonso v. Villamor, ―technicality, when it deserts its proper office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy, deserves scant consideration from courts; there should be no vested rights in technicalities‖; litigants cannot relish in their legal winnings which they are clearly underserving of under the law by scoring undue advantage over the

procedural mistakes of the opponent. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



Case law instructs that ―it is a more prudent course of action for the court to excuse a technical lapse and afford the parties a review of the case on appeal rather than dispose of the case on technicality and cause a grave injustice to the parties, giving a false impression of speedy disposal of cases while actually resulting in more delay, if not miscarriage of justice." (Tamboa vs. People, G.R. 248264, July 27, 2020)



From time to time, however, we have recognized exceptions to the rules but only for the most compelling reasons, where stubborn obedience to the rules would defeat rather than serve the ends of justice; every plea for a liberal construction of the rules must at least be accompanied by an explanation of why the party-litigant failed to comply with the rules and by a justification for the requested liberal construction; where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, we may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its legal jurisdiction. (Abpi vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 252367, July 14, 2020)



It should be observed that "if a rigid application of the rules of procedure will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice in light of the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. (Tamboa vs. People, G.R. 248264, July 27, 2020)



Substantial justice trumps over procedural rigidities; if a strict application of the rules of procedure will frustrate rather than serve the broader interests of justice under the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition, the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction. (Ganancial vs. Cabugao, G.R. 203348, July 6, 2020)



The Court deems it proper to relax the technical rules of procedure in order to afford petitioner the fullest opportunity to establish the merits of her appeal. (Tamboa vs. People, G.R. 248264, July 27, 2020)



The Court has allowed several cases to proceed in the broader interest of justice despite procedural defects and lapses; this is in keeping with the principle that rules of procedure are mere tools designed to facilitate the attainment of justice. (Spouses Cordero vs. Octaviano, G.R. 241385, July 7, 2020)



The petition must show when notice of the assailed judgment or order or resolution was received; when the motion for reconsideration was filed; and, when notice of its denial was received; however, this Court may relax strict

observance of the rules to advance substantial justice. (Spouses Cordero vs.

Octaviano, G.R. 241385, July 7, 2020)



#### STATUTORY RAPE



Commission of 
- Accused-appellant cannot be convicted of statutory rape where the victim‘s correct age was not properly alleged in the information; otherwise, accused-appellant would be deprived of his right to be informed of the charge lodged against him; accused-appellant should be convicted of qualified rape, as it was not only alleged in the information but also proven during the trial that the victim was under eighteen years old at the commission of the crime, and the daughter of accused-appellant. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020)



In statutory rape, it is enough that the age of the victim is proven and that there was sexual intercourse; it is not necessary to prove that the victim was intimidated or that force was used against her, because in statutory rape the law presumes that the victim, on account of her tender age, does not and cannot have a will of her own. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



Sexual intercourse with a woman who is below 12 years of age constitutes statutory rape; as a qualification, Article 266-B of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, provides that the death penalty shall be imposed "when the victim is a child below seven (7) years old"; the age of the victim (four [4] years old) was sufficiently alleged in the Information and proved by the prosecution. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



Elements 
- Statutory rape is committed when: (1) the offended party is under twelve
(12) years of age; and (2) the accused has carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation, whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness, or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



#### SUPREME COURT



Judicial review from the CA's Rule 65 Decision on a labor case 
- In the case of Manggagawa ng Komunikasyon sa Pilipinas v. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., Inc., this Court reiterated the adoption of particular parameters of judicial review from the CA's Rule 65 Decision on a labor case, to wit: in a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. (Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc./Tiwi Consolidated Union (APRI-TCU) on Behalf of Fe

R. Rubio, et al. vs. Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc., et al., G.R. 237036, July 8, 2020)



Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision; in ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the

same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. (Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc./Tiwi Consolidated Union (APRI-TCU) on Behalf of Fe R. Rubio, et al. vs. Aboitiz Power Renewables, Inc., et al., G.R. 237036, July 8, 2020)



#### TAXATION



Claim for tax credit or refund of creditable input taxes 
- The Court clarifies that the above disquisition only finds application to those claims for refund made prior to June 11, 2014 (i.e., the date that RMC No. 54-2014 was issued); under this new circular, the taxpayer is now required to submit complete documents upon its filing of an administrative claim for VAT refund/tax credit, as no other documents shall be accepted thereafter; for this purpose, the taxpayer shall also execute a statement under oath attesting to the completeness of said documents which shall also be submitted upon such filing. (Zuellig-Pharma Asia Pacific Ltd. Phils. ROHQ vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), G.R. 244154, July 15, 2020)



The Court held that the 120-day period should be reckoned from the time the taxpayer had deemed itself to have submitted the complete documents in support of its administrative claim, without prejudice to the BIR's request for additional documents which did not obtain in this case; thus, with the 120 days having lapsed therefrom, the taxpayer may then, within thirty (30) days, accordingly, file its judicial claim for refund, as was done by the taxpayer in Pilipinas Total Gas. (Zuellig-Pharma Asia Pacific Ltd. Phils. ROHQ vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), G.R. 244154, July 15, 2020)



There is no requirement in the Tax Code or in RMC No. 49-2003 that the taxing authority's request for additional documents should be made in a specific form; nowhere in the law does it require that the request for additional documents must always and absolutely be made in written form; while written requests would be preferred because it would be easier for the BIR to keep track of the documents submitted by the taxpayer in response thereto, the law does not explicitly prohibit verbal requests for additional documents as long as they are duly made by authorized BIR officials. (Zuellig-Pharma Asia Pacific Ltd. Phils. ROHQ vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), G.R. 244154, July 15, 2020)



Under Section 112 (C) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 (Tax Code), the CIR has a period of 120 days from the date of submission of complete documents within which to evaluate an administrative claim for tax credit or refund of creditable input taxes (120-day period); if the CIR denies the administrative claim, or if it remains unacted upon the expiration of the said period which is essentially considered a "denial due to inaction," the taxpayer

may, within thirty (30) days from such denial or expiration, avail of the further remedy of filing a judicial claim before the CTA. (Zuellig-Pharma Asia Pacific Ltd. Phils. ROHQ vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), G.R. 244154, July 15, 2020)



Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
- The power of the CIR to enter into compromise agreements for deficiency taxes is explicit in Section 204(A) of the 1997 National Internal Revenue Code, as amended (1997 NIRC); the CIR may compromise an assessment when a reasonable doubt as to the validity of the claim against the taxpayer exists, or the financial position of the taxpayer demonstrates a clear inability to pay the tax. (Kepco Philippines Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. Nos. 225750-51, July 28, 2020)



Local business taxes 
- The rules on tax allocation in relation to tax situs under Sec. 150 of R.A. 7160 come into play when a business subject to it does not operate a branch or sales office outside of its principal office where all sales are recorded, but has a factory, project office, plant, or plantation situated in different localities, whether or not sales are made in these localities. (People vs. Yumol, G.R. 225600, July 7, 2020)



(The City of Makati vs. The Municipality of Bakun, et al., G.R. 225226, July 7, 2020)



National Internal Revenue Code 
- For purposes of zero-rating under Section 108(B)(2) of the Tax Code, the claimant must establish the two components of a client's NRFC status, viz.: (1) that their client was established under the laws of a country not the Philippines or, simply, is not a domestic corporation; and (2) that it is not engaged in trade or business in the Philippines; to be sure, there must, be sufficient proof of both of these components: showing not only that the clients are foreign corporations, but also are not doing business in the Philippines. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Deutsche Knowledge Services Pte. Ltd., G.R. 234445, July 15, 2020)



In Pilipinas Total Gas, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Court emphasized that the law accords the claimant sufficient latitude to determine the completeness of his submission for the purpose of ascertaining the date of completion from which the 120-day period shall be reckoned. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Deutsche Knowledge Services Pte. Ltd., G.R. 234445, July 15, 2020)



Revenue Memorandum Circular No. 42-03 
- RMC 49-03 explicitly empowers the tax authorities to request for additional documents that will aid them in verifying the claim; if its supporting documents were incomplete, the BIR was duty-bound to notify DKS of its deficiencies and require them to make further submissions, as necessary. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Deutsche Knowledge Services Pte. Ltd., G.R. 234445, July 15, 2020)



Taxability of membership fees 
- Income is defined as "an amount of money coming to a person or corporation within a specified time, whether as payment for services, interest or profit from investment" while capital is the "fund" or "wealth"; based on the foregoing, the Court considered membership fees and the like as "capital", as they are intended for the upkeep of the facilities and operations of the recreational clubs, and not to generate revenue; it is only the recreational club's income which should be subject to taxation, as "the State cannot impose tax on capital as it constitutes an unconstitutional confiscation of property." (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Federation of Golf Clubs of the Philippines, Inc., G.R. 226449, July 28, 2020)



Section 105 of the 1997 N1RC specified the taxability of only those which deal with the "sale, barter or exchange of goods or properties, or sale of service"; in collecting such fees from their members, recreational clubs are not selling any kind of service, in the same way that the members are not procuring service from them; "there could be no sale, barter or exchange of goods or properties, or sale of a service to speak of, which would then be subject to VAT under the 1997 NIRC". (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Federation of Golf Clubs of the Philippines, Inc., G.R. 226449, July 28, 2020)



Value added tax 
- Sales of "other services," such as those qualifying services rendered by DKS to its foreign affiliates-clients, shall be zero-rated pursuant to Section 108(B)(2)53 of the Tax Code if the following conditions are met: first, the seller is VAT-registered; second, the services are rendered "to a person engaged in business conducted outside the Philippines or to a nonresident person not engaged in business who is outside the Philippines when the services are performed"; third, services are "paid for in acceptable foreign currency and accounted in accordance with BSP rules and regulations." (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Deutsche Knowledge Services Pte. Ltd., G.R. 234445, July 15, 2020)



Under Section 4.112-1(a) of Revenue Regulations No. (RR) 16-05, otherwise known as the Consolidated VAT Regulations of 2005, in relation to Section 112 of the Tax Code, a claimant's entitlement to a tax refund or credit of excess input VAT attributable to zero-rated sales hinges upon the following requisites: "(1) the taxpayer must be VAT-registered; (2) the taxpayer must be engaged in sales which are zero-rated or effectively zero-rated; (3) the claim must be filed within two years after the close of the taxable quarter when such sales were made; and (4) the creditable input tax due or paid must be attributable to such sales, except the transitional input tax, to the extent that such input tax has not been applied against the output tax." (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Deutsche Knowledge Services Pte. Ltd., G.R. 234445, July 15, 2020)



#### TRUST

Implied trust 
- The Civil Code provides that a trust is created when a property is sold to one party but paid for by another for the purpose of having beneficial interest in said property. (Spouses Devisfruto vs. Greenfell, G.R. 227725, July 1, 2020)



#### UNJUST ENRICHMENT



Principle of 
- Article 22 of the Civil Code provides: Article 22. Every person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or comes into possession of something at the expense of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return the same to him. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



#### UNLAWFUL DETAINER



Action for 
- An action for unlawful detainer is filed only for the purpose of recovering physical possession or possession de facto; when the defendant raises the defense of ownership and the question of possession cannot be resolved without passing upon the issue of ownership, a determination of ownership should be made but only to determine the issue of possession; any pronouncement made by the court over the issue of ownership in such cases is merely provisional. (Eupena vs. Bobier, G.R. 211078, July 8, 2020)



In all actions for unlawful detainer, the fact of permission or tolerance serves as a key jurisdictional element; for the action to prosper, the claimant must allege and prove that: (i) initially, possession of property by the defendant was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff; (ii) eventually, such possession became illegal upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination of the latter's right of possession; (iii) thereafter, the defendant remained in possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of the enjoyment thereof; and (iv) within one year from the last demand on defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted the complaint for ejectment. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



In an action for unlawful detainer, the complainant must prove through a preponderance of evidence that he/she consented to the possession of the property through positive acts; where there the property, and who granted them permission to enter. (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



In Dr. Carbonilla v. Abiera, et al. and Javelosa, "tolerance always carries with it 'permission' and not merely silence or inaction for silence or inaction is negligence, not tolerance"; in Javelosa v. Tapus, the Court emphasized that tolerance cannot be confused with indifference or neglect to file an action in court; this doctrine was further reinforced in Lozano v. Fernandez, where the Court characterized "tolerance as more than mere passivity," and clarified that "inaction should not be confused with tolerance as the latter transcends silence

and connotes permission to possess the property subject of an unlawful detainer case." (Dayandayan, et al. vs. Spouses Rojas, G.R. 227411, July 15, 2020)



The Court has held that for an unlawful detainer suit to prosper, the plaintiff- lessor must show that: first, initially, the defendant-lessee legally possessed the leased premises by virtue of a subsisting lease contract; second, such possession eventually became illegal, either due to the latter's violation of the provisions of the said lease contract or the termination thereof; third, the defendant-lessee remained in possession of the leased premises, thus, effectively depriving the plaintiff-lessor enjoyment thereof; and fourth, there must be a demand both to pay or to comply and vacate and that the suit is brought within one (1) year from the last demand. (Brig. General Collao, Jr., in his capacity as Commanding General, Headquarters and Headquarters Support Group, Philippine Army vs. Albania,

G.R. 228905, July 15, 2020)



The restitution of the money received as downpayment for the sale of a property that did not push through, is a subject matter beyond the jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court (MTC) to resolve and a relief more than what the same may award in an ejectment case. (Reburiano vs. De Vera, G.R. 243896, July 15, 2020)



The sending of notices to vacate, coupled with the filing of the ejectment suit, constitute categorical acts on the part of the lessor showing that it is no longer amenable to another renewal of the lease contract. (Brig. General Collao, Jr., in his capacity as Commanding General, Headquarters and Headquarters Support Group, Philippine Army vs. Albania, G.R. 228905, July 15, 2020)



Where the lessor‘s ownership over the leased property is invalid, the lease agreement upon which the unlawful detainer complaint is based, is void. (Eupena vs. Bobier, G.R. 211078, July 8, 2020)



#### VENUE



Rule on 
- Venue is "the place where the case is to be heard or tried"; under our Rules, the venue of an action generally depends on whether it is a real or personal action; real actions are those affecting the title or possession of a real property, or interest therein, to be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated; all other actions, called personal actions, may be commenced and tried where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs reside, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants reside, at the election of the plaintiff. (Kane vs. Roggenkamp, G.R. 214326, July 6, 2020)



#### VERIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION AGAINST FORUM SHOPPING

Rule on 
- The rule on verification of a pleading is a formal, not jurisdictional, requirement; non-compliance with the verification requirement does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective, as it is substantially complied with when signed by one who has ample knowledge of the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct; certification, not signed by a duly authorized person, meanwhile, renders the petition subject to dismissal; but there are cases when this Court acts with leniency due to the presence of special circumstances or compelling reasons. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al., G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



When the counsel who signed the certification was given a special power of attorney by the client, there is substantial compliance with the rules on verification and certification against forum shopping; consistent with the Court's vow to render and dispense justice, we will not hesitate in relaxing procedural rules, if needed, so as not to unjustly deprive a litigant the chance to present his or her case on the merits. (Eagle Clarc Shipping Philippines, Inc., et al. vs. National Labor Relations Commission (Fourth Division), et al., G.R. 245370, July 13, 2020)



#### WITNESSES



Credibility of 
- A rape victim cannot be expected to mechanically keep and then give an accurate account of the traumatic and horrifying experience she had undergone; inaccuracies and inconsistencies in her testimony are generally expected; such fact, alone cannot automatically result in an accused‘s acquittal. (People vs. AAA, G.R. 248777, July 7, 2020)



A young girl‘s revelation that she had been raped coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity cannot be so easily dismissed as a mere concoction. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



Although the conduct of the victim immediately following the alleged sexual assault is of utmost importance in establishing the truth or falsity of the charge, it is not correct to expect a typical reaction or norm of behavior from rape victims; the workings of the human mind when placed under emotional stress are unpredictable. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)




- Family resentment, revenge or feuds have never swayed us from giving full credence to the testimony of a complainant for rape, especially a minor who remained steadfast and unyielding throughout the direct and cross-examination that she was sexually abused. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020)

In rape cases, conviction or acquittal may solely depend on the private complainants' credibility, as only they can testify on its occurrence. (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)



In resolving rape cases, the primary consideration is almost always given to the credibility of AAA‘s testimony; when the latter‘s testimony is credible, it may be the sole basis for the accused person‘s conviction since, owing to the nature of the offense, in many cases, the only evidence that can be given regarding the matter is the testimony of the offended party. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



It is a settled rule that the lower court's appreciation of the witnesses' testimony deserves the highest respect because it "is best equipped to make the assessment of the witnesses' credibility and demeanor on the witness stand"; absent any showing of clear misappreciation, the trial court's findings are generally not disturbed by this Court. (Aleson Shipping Lines vs. CGU International Ins. PLC., et al., G.R. 217311, July 15, 2020)



It is elementary that the assessment of a trial court in matters pertaining to the credibility of witnesses, especially when already affirmed by an appellate court on appeal, are accorded great respect if not binding significance on further appeal to this Court; the rationale of this rule is the recognition of the trial court's unique and distinctive position to be able to observe, first hand, the demeanor, conduct and attitude of the witness whose credibility has been put in issue. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



It is settled that "factual findings of the trial court and its evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal, unless the trial court is shown to have overlooked, misapprehended, or misapplied any fact or circumstance of weight and substance." (People vs. Ibañez, G.R. 231984, July 6, 2020)



Settled is the rule that delay in reporting the incident does not weaken AAA‘s testimony; delay in revealing the commission of a crime such as rape does not necessarily render such charge unworthy of belief; this is because the victim may choose to keep quiet rather than expose her defilement to the harsh glare of public scrutiny; only when the delay is unreasonable or unexplained may it work to discredit the complainant. (People vs. AAA, G.R. 248777, July 7, 2020)



Settled is the rule that the trial court's evaluation and conclusion on the credibility of witnesses in rape cases are generally accorded great weight and respect, and at times even finality, and that its findings are binding and conclusive on the appellate court, unless there is a clear showing that they were reached arbitrarily or it appears from the records that certain facts or circumstances of weight, substance or value were overlooked, misapprehended or misappreciated by the

lower court and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case. (People vs. ZZZ, G.R. 232500, July 28, 2020)



Suffice it to state that the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies is a matter best undertaken by the trial court because of its unique opportunity to observe the witnesses firsthand and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under grueling examination. (People vs. Yumol, G.R. 225600, July 7, 2020)



The alleged inconsistency on the place where the crime happened is a minor inconsistency which should generally be given liberal appreciation considering that the place of the commission of the crime in rape cases is after all not an essential element thereof. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



The assessment of the credibility of witnesses lies within the province and competence of trial courts; a trial court judge is in the best position to weigh the testimonies of witnesses in the light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct, and attitude during trial, and is therefore placed in a more competent position to discriminate between truth and falsehood. (People vs. Lopez, G.R. 234157, July 15, 2020)



The Court explained in People v. Pareja that the assessment of the witness' credibility is best left to the trial court judge in view of his/her unique opportunity to observe the witness' deportment and demeanor on the stand; this vantage point is not available to the appellate courts; the findings of the trial court, when affirmed by the CA, are generally binding and conclusive upon this Court. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



The Court has consistently ruled that when a rape victim‘s straightforward and truthful testimony conforms with the medical findings of the examining doctor, the same is sufficient to support a conviction for rape. (People vs. Yumol, G.R. 225600, July 7, 2020)



The rule is settled that when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are accorded finality, unless the records show facts or circumstances of material weight and substance that the lower court overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated, and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of the case. (People vs. AAA, G.R. 248777, July 7, 2020)



The rule that is applicable in the present case is that the trial court's assignment of probative value to witnesses' testimonies will not be disturbed except when significant matters were overlooked, because it has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness on the stand; the trial courts findings acquire even greater weight once affirmed on appeal; in light of the foregoing, the Court finds

no reason to depart from the factual findings of the RTC, as affirmed by the CA, as there is no indication that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case. (People vs. Oledan, G.R. 240692, July 15, 2020)



The straightforward and categorical testimony of the victim and her positive identification of the accused must prevail over the uncorroborated and self- serving denial of the latter; a young girl's revelation that she had been raped or sexually assaulted, coupled with her voluntary submission to medical examination and willingness to undergo public trial where she could be compelled to give out the details of an assault on her dignity, cannot be so easily dismissed as mere concoction. (ABC vs. People, G.R. 241591, July 8, 2020)



The victim‘s conduct after the sexual molestation and her inability to report the incident are also not enough to discredit her; victims of a crime as heinous as rape, cannot be expected to act within reason or in accordance with society‘s expectations. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 230981, July 15, 2020)



This Court has ruled that "inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses which refer to minor and insignificant details cannot destroy their credibility; such minor inconsistencies even guarantee truthfulness and candor"; it is well settled that immaterial and insignificant details do not discredit a testimony on the very material and significant point bearing on the very act of accused-appellants; as long as the testimonies of the witnesses corroborate one another on material points, minor inconsistencies therein cannot destroy their credibility. Inconsistencies on minor details do not undermine the integrity of a prosecution witness. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



This Court has ruled that since human memory is fickle and prone to the stresses of emotions, accuracy in a testimonial account has never been used as a standard in testing the credibility of a witness; this is especially true when the testimony is given by child victims who were exposed to extremely traumatic situations at a very tender age. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



Time and again, this Court has held that when the offended parties are young and immature girls, as in this case, courts are inclined to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability, but also the shame and embarrassment to which they would be exposed if the matter about which they testified were not true. (People vs. Fetalco, G.R. 241249, July 28, 2020)



Utmost credence is generally given to the factual findings and assessment of the credibility of witnesses made by the trial court, especially when upheld by the court of appeals, because it is the trial court which had the opportunity to observe the deportment of witnesses on the stand. (People vs. Alcala, et al., G.R. 233319, July 7, 2020)



Victims may not be expected to act with reason or conformably with the usual expectation of mankind; the failure of the victim to run, shout or seek help does not negate rape. (People vs. Tamano, G.R. 227866, July 8, 2020)



Well-entrenched is the rule that the matter of assigning values to declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the trial judge who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimonies in light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and position to discriminate between truth and falsehood; this is especially true when the trial court's findings have been affirmed by the appellate court, because said findings are generally conclusive and binding upon this Court, unless it be manifestly shown that the lower courts had overlooked or disregarded arbitrarily the facts and circumstances of significance in the case. (People vs. Siu Ming Tat, et al., G.R. 246577, July 13, 2020)



When the issues involve matters of credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies, and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said findings, are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect. (People vs. Silvederio III, G.R. 239777, July 8, 2020)

## 2020 E


#### AUGUST 2020

#### ACCION PUBLICIANA

Civil action for 
- Accion publiciana is an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession of realty independent of title; it refers to an ejectment suit filed after the expiration of one year from the accrual of the cause of action or from the unlawful withholding of possession of the realty; it is an ordinary civil proceeding to determine the better right of possession of realty independently of title. (Heirs of Eutiquio Elliot, represented by Meriquita Elliot, et al. vs. Corcuera, G.R. 233767, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### ACTIONS

Action for reconveyance 
- In an action for reconveyance, the decree is not sought to be set aside, as the same is respected as incontrovertible and no longer open to review; what is being sought is the transfer or reconveyance of the land from the registered owner to the rightful owner. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

- In Heirs of Kionisala v. Heirs of Dacut, the Court distinguished between an action for nullity or cancellation of free patents, an action for reversion and an action for reconveyance, thus: an ordinary civil action for declaration of nullity of free patents and certificates of title is not the same as an action for reversion; the difference between them lies in the allegations as to the character of ownership of the realty whose title is sought to be nullified. (Esguerra, substituted by her Heirs vs. Spouses Ignacio, et al., G.R. 216597, Aug. 26, 2020)

- With respect to the purported cause of action for reconveyance, it is settled that in this kind of action the free patent and the certificate of title are respected as incontrovertible; what is sought instead is the transfer of the property, in this case the title thereof, which has been wrongfully or erroneously registered in the defendant's name; all that must be alleged in the complaint are two (2) facts which admitting them to be true would entitle the plaintiff to recover title to the disputed land, namely, (1) that the plaintiff was the owner of the land and, (2) that the defendant had illegally dispossessed him of the same. (Esguerra, substituted by her Heirs vs. Spouses Ignacio, et al., G.R. 216597, Aug. 26, 2020)

Actions for nullity or cancellation of free patents, for reversion, and for reconveyance 
- In an action for reversion, the pertinent allegations in the complaint would admit State ownership of the disputed land; on the other hand, a cause of action for declaration of nullity of free patent and certificate of title would require allegations of the plaintiff's ownership of the contested lot prior to the issuance of such free patent and certificate of title as well as the defendant's fraud or mistake; as the case may be, in successfully obtaining these documents of title over the parcel of land claimed by plaintiffs, the real party-in-interest is not the State but the plaintiff who alleges a pre-existing right of ownership over the parcel of land in question even before the grant of title to the defendant. (Esguerra, substituted by her Heirs vs. Spouses Ignacio, et al., G.R. 216597, Aug. 26, 2020)

Moot and academic cases 
- A case becomes moot and academic when it "ceases to present a justiciable controversy because of supervening events so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value." (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- In Land Bank of the Philippines v. Fastech Synergy Philippines. Inc., this Court reiterated the exceptions to this rule: In Timbol v. Commission on Elections: A case is moot and academic if it "ceases to present a justiciable controversy because of supervening events so that a declaration thereon would be of no practical use or value." (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- There is no actual substantial relief which a petitioner would be entitled to, and which would be negated by the dismissal of the petition; courts generally decline jurisdiction over such case or dismiss it on the ground of mootness; this is because the judgment will not serve any useful purpose or have any practical legal effect because, in the nature of things, it cannot be enforced." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- To expound, "a case or issue is considered moot and academic when it ceases to present a justiciable controversy by virtue of supervening events, so that an adjudication of the case or a declaration on the issue would be of no practical value or use." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- When a case is moot and academic, this court generally declines jurisdiction over it; there are recognized exceptions to this rule; this court has taken cognizance of moot and academic cases when: (1) there was a grave violation of the Constitution; (2) the case involved a situation of exceptional character and was of paramount public interest; (3) the issues raised required the formulation of controlling principles to guide the Bench, the Bar and the public; and (4) the case was capable of repetition yet evading review. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

Doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies 
- In questioning the validity or constitutionality of a rule or regulation issued by an administrative agency, a party need not exhaust administrative remedies before going to court, as this principle applies only when the act of the administrative agency concerned was performed pursuant to its quasi-judicial function, and not when the assailed act pertained to its rule-making or quasi-legislative power; doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, not applicable to question the validity of Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC) Department Order No. 2007-28, as the same was enacted pursuant to the DOTC's exercise of its delegated legislative power. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

Office of the Solicitor General 
- In any criminal case or proceeding, only the OSG may bring or defend actions on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, or represent the People or State before the Supreme Court and the CA; this is explicitly provided under Section 35(1), Chapter 12, Title III, Book III of the 1987 Administrative Code of the Philippines, thus: (1) Represent the Government in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals in all criminal proceedings; represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and all other courts or tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in which the Government or any officer thereof in his official capacity is a party. (JCLV Realty & Development Corporation vs. Mangali, G.R. 236618, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### ALIBI

Defense of 
- Jurisprudentially, while his alibi can be considered as a valid defense, the following elements must be alleged and proven for it to be entitled merit: (a) that he was present at another place at the time of the perpetration of the crime, and (b) that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime during its commission. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Physical impossibility refers to distance and the facility of access between the crime scene and the location of the accused when the crime was committed; he must demonstrate that he was so far away and could not have been physically present at the crime scene and its immediate vicinity when the crime was committed. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### AN ACT ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT OR THE VALUE OF PROPERTY AND DAMAGE ON WHICH A PENALTY IS BASED AND THE FINES IMPOSED UNDER THE REVISED PENAL CODE (R.A. 10951)

Application of 
- On August 29, 2017, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed into law R.A. 10951 that sought, among others, to help indigent prisoners and individuals accused of committing petty crimes; it also increased the fines for treason and the publication of false news; and likewise increased the baseline amounts and values of property and damage to make them commensurate to the penalties meted on the offenses committed in relation to them. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Pursuant to Section 81 of R.A. 10951, any person found guilty of theft under Article 309 of the RPC, as amended, shall be punished by arresto mayor to its full extent, if the value of the thing stolen is over P500.00 but does not exceed P5,000.00. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### APPEALS

Appeal in criminal cases 
- In criminal cases, an appeal throws the entire case wide open for review and the reviewing tribunal can correct errors, though unassigned in the appealed judgment, or even reverse the trial court's decision based on grounds other than those that the parties raised as errors; the appeal confers the appellate court full jurisdiction over the case and renders such court competent to examine records, revise the judgment appealed from, increase the penalty, and cite the proper provision of the penal law. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

Appeal in rape cases 
- In this jurisdiction, the Court is guided by the well-established principles laid down in the disposition and review of rape cases, to wit: (1) the prosecution has to show the guilt of the accused by proof beyond reasonable doubt or that degree of proof that, to an unprejudiced mind, produces conviction; (2) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and cannot draw strength from the weakness of the evidence of the defense; (3) unless there are special reasons, the findings of trial courts, especially regarding the credibility of witnesses, are entitled to great respect and will not be disturbed on appeal; (4) an accusation for rape can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove; and (5) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 239906, Aug. 26, 2020)

Factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies 
- As a rule, factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies such as the NLRC are generally accorded not only respect but also finality because of the special knowledge and expertise gained by these agencies from handling matters under their specialized jurisdiction. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

Factual findings of the Court of Tax Appeals 
- It has been the long-standing policy and practice of the Court to respect the conclusions of quasi-judicial agencies such as the CTA, a highly specialized body specifically created for the purpose of reviewing tax cases; in the absence of any clear and convincing proof that the findings of the CTA are not supported by substantial evidence or that there is a showing that it committed a gross error or abuse, the Court must presume that the CTA rendered a decision which is valid in every respect. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

- "It is doctrinal that the Court will not lightly set aside the conclusions reached by the CTA which, by the very nature of its functions, has accordingly developed an exclusive expertise on the resolution unless there has been an abuse or improvident exercise of authority." (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The Court recognizes that the CTA's findings can only be disturbed on appeal if they are not supported by substantial evidence, or there is a showing of gross error or abuse on the part of the tax court. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

Factual findings of the trial courts 
- Factual findings of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court has overlooked or ignored some fact or circumstance of sufficient weight or significance, which, if considered, would alter the result of the case. (Esguerra, substituted by her Heirs vs. Spouses Ignacio, et al., G.R. 216597, Aug. 26, 2020)

- It should be noted that the trial court was in the best position to assess and determine the credibility of the witnesses presented by both parties; since there is no indication that the said court overlooked, misunderstood, or misapplied the surrounding facts and circumstances of the case, the Court finds no reason to deviate from its factual findings. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

- When affirmed by the CA, are generally binding on this Court; subject to recognized exceptions, it is not the function of the Court to review, analyze and weigh all over again evidence already considered in the proceedings below. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

Petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 
- A petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court should raise only questions of law which must be distinctly set forth; a question is one of law when the appellate court can determine the issue raised without reviewing or evaluating the evidence; otherwise, it is a question of fact. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

- As a rule, only questions of law are entertained in Petition for Review under Rule 45, and only in exceptional circumstances has the Court entertained questions of facts. (Magalona vs. People, G.R. 229332, Aug. 27, 2020)

- At the outset, it bears stressing that a review of appeals filed before this Court is "not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion." (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Even if the question be considered as one of fact, this case falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the general rule that this Court is not a trier of facts considering that the findings of the CA are contrary to those of the RTC. (Heirs of Isabelo Cudal, Sr., Represented by Libertad Cudal, et al. vs. Spouses Suguitan, Jr., G.R. 244405, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Factual issues are beyond the ambit of the court's jurisdiction in a petition for review on certiorari, as it is not the court's task to go over the proofs presented below to ascertain if they were appreciated and weighed correctly, most especially when the trial court and the appellate court speak as one in their findings and conclusions. (The Commoner Lending Corporation, represented by Ma. Nory Alcala vs. Spouses Villanueva, G.R. 235260, Aug. 27, 2020)

- It is long-settled that questions of fact have no place in petitions for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

- It may resolve the case on the merits instead of remanding the case to the Court of Appeals in order to prevent further delay in its disposition and for purposes of economy and expediency; it is within the plenary power of the Supreme Court to review matters even those not raised on appeal if it finds that their consideration is necessary in arriving at a just disposition of the case. (Mascariñas vs. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc., G.R. 228138, Aug, 27, 2020)

- The Court may review factual issues if any of the following is present: (1) when the findings are grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) when there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) when in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) when the findings are contrary to the trial court; (8) when the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) when the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) when the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; and (11) when the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. (Magalona vs. People, G.R. 229332, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The general rule in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is that only questions of law shall be raised; in Republic v. Heirs of Santiago, the Court enumerated that one of the exceptions to the general rule is when the CA's findings are contrary to those of the trial court. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

(Bayview Management Consultants, Inc., et al. vs. Pre, G.R. 220170, Aug. 19, 2020)

- While the existence of an employer-employee relationship is a factual matter generally beyond the purview of a Rule 45 petition, the Court finds that three (3) of the recognized exceptions to the rule obtain in this case, viz.: (1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and (10) The finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on records. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020)

Question of fact 
- A question of fact exists when "the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or falsehood of facts or when the query invites calibration of the whole evidence considering mainly the credibility of the witnesses, the existence and relevance of specific surrounding circumstances, as well as their relation to each other and to the whole, and the probability of the situation." (Magalona vs. People, G.R. 229332, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### ARSON LAW (P.D. NO. 1613)

Elements 
- The elements of the crime are: (a) there is intentional burning; and (b) what is intentionally burned is an inhabited house or dwelling; in People v. Gil, appellant therein was convicted of the crime of arson with homicide for willfully setting fire to a residential house by pouring kerosene on a mattress and igniting it with a lighter, directly and immediately causing the death of the person occupying the same. (People vs. Soria, G.R. 248372, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### ATTORNEYS

Disbarment 
- The penalty of disbarment should be imposed with great caution for clear cases of misconduct that seriously affects the standing and character of an officer of the court. (Ignacio vs. Atty. Ignacio, A.C. No. 9426 [CBD Case No. 13-3819], Aug. 25, 2020)

Gross immorality 
- A lawyer's culpability for gross immorality is not dependent on whether the other party knowingly engaged in an immoral relationship with him. (Ignacio vs. Atty. Ignacio, A.C. No. 9426 [CBD Case No. 13-3819], Aug. 25, 2020)

- Canon 1, Rule 1.01 and Canon 7, Rule 7.03 of the Code of Professional Responsibility mandate all lawyers to possess good moral character at the time of their application for admission to the Bar and require them to maintain such character until their retirement from the practice of law; a lawyer may be removed or suspended from the practice of law for grossly immoral conduct. (Ignacio vs. Atty. Ignacio, A.C. No. 9426 [CBD Case No. 13-3819], Aug. 25, 2020)

#### BAIL

Grant of 
- Applying to petitioner's bail application the foregoing law of the case as defined in Napoles v. Sandiganbayan is quite different from denying petitioner's bail application because, as held in Napoles v. Sandiganbayan, the prosecution had presented strong evidence against Napoles and, by extension, her co-conspirators. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- As bail applications pertain to a collateral issue, and the proceedings thereon are summary in nature and "avoid unnecessary thoroughness," the resolution denying or granting bail need not be detailed or exhaustive. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The resolution denying or granting bail need not be detailed or exhaustive, as the same is considered sufficient if it informs the applicant and oppositor of the facts and the law that form the basis of the denial or grant of bail; resolution of the Sandiganbayan on petitioner's bail applications, found sufficient. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### CERTIORARI

Petition for 
- In labor cases, the Court of Appeals is empowered to evaluate the materiality and significance of the evidence alleged to have been capriciously, whimsically, or arbitrarily disregarded by the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in relation to all other evidence on record; the Supreme Court is not precluded from reviewing the factual issues when there are conflicting findings by the Court of Appeals, the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter. (Maryville Manila, Inc. vs. Espinosa, G.R. 229372, Aug. 27, 2020)

- In Madrigal Transport, Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corporation, we had the occasion to state that a petition for certiorari, not being a substitute for a lost appeal, cannot prosper if an appeal is available even when the ground is grave abuse of discretion. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- In Thenamaris Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, the Court clarified that while a petition for certiorari must be filed strictly within sixty (60) days from notice of judgment or from the order denying a motion for reconsideration, the period may be extended subject to the court's sound discretion; for this purpose, one should be able to provide a reasonable or meritorious explanation for his or her failure to comply with the sixty-day period. (Mascariñas vs. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc., G.R. 228138, Aug, 27, 2020)

- The Court will not review any errors allegedly committed by the COA in its decisions, unless tainted with grave abuse of discretion; the Constitution itself, as well as the Rules of Court, provide the remedy of a petition for certiorari under Rule 64 in relation to Rule 65 in order to restrict the scope of inquiry to errors of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction committed by the COA. (Ablong, et al. vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 233308, Aug. 18, 2020)

- The issue of whether grave abuse of discretion is committed or not is a question of law which the Supreme Court may properly resolve in a petition therefor. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The proper procedure to assail the Ombudsman's dismissal of an administrative case or the administrative aspect of its decision, is via a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, ascribing grave abuse of discretion, to be filed with the CA. (Eleazar, et al. vs. Office of the Ombudsman, et al., G.R. 224399, Aug. 24, 2020)

- While a judgment of acquittal may be assailed by the People through a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 without placing the accused in double jeopardy, however, it must be established that the court a quo acted without jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess or lack of jurisdiction; the People must show that the prosecution was denied the opportunity to present its case or where the trial was a sham, thus, rendering the assailed judgment void. (People vs. Arcega, G.R. 237489, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### CERTIORARI AND PROHIBITION

Writ of 
- In Araullo v. Aquino III, it was held that petitions for certiorari and prohibition filed before the Court "are the remedies by which the grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government may be determined under the Constitution." (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- It is also settled that petitions for certiorari and prohibition are proper remedies to correct acts tainted with grave abuse of discretion. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- It was explained that "with respect to the Court, the remedies of certiorari and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the writ of certiorari or prohibition may be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions, but also to set right, undo, and restrain any act of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the Government, even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### COMMISSION ON AUDIT (COA)

COA Circular No. 2009-006 
- Section 10.2 of COA Circular No. 2009-006 which categorically requires service of the ND to all the persons liable, viz.: 10.2 The ND shall be addressed to the agency head and the accountant; served on the persons liable; and shall indicate the transactions and amount disallowed, reasons for the disallowance, the laws/rules/regulations violated, and persons liable; it shall be signed by both the Audit Team Leader and the Supervising Auditor. (Ablong, et al. vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 233308, Aug. 18, 2020)

#### COMMUNITY SERVICE ACT (R.A. 11362)

Application of 
- Under R.A. 11362, also known as the Community Service Act, the Court may, in its discretion, and lieu of service in jail, require that the penalties of arresto menor and arresto mayor be served by the defendant by rendering community service in the place where the crime was committed, and under such terms as the court shall determine, taking into consideration the gravity of the offense and the circumstances of the case. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### COMPREHENSIVE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 2002 (R.A. 9165)

Chain of custody 
- As may be gleaned from the explicit wording of [Section 13, Article II, R.A. 9165], nowhere does the law qualify that the above-stated instances must have been intended for the purpose of using illegal drugs; in fact, under Section 13, Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of RA 9165, the phrase "company of at least two (2) persons" was defined to "mean the accused or suspect plus at least two (2) others, who may or may not be in possession of any dangerous drug"; this means that the only qualification for the provision to trigger is that the accused or suspect possessed illegal drugs in the proximate company of such persons who may or may not be in possession of any dangerous drugs. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

- As part of the chain of custody procedure, the apprehending team is mandated, immediately after seizure and confiscation, to conduct a physical inventory and to photograph the seized items in the presence of the accused or the person from whom the items were seized, or his representative or counsel, as well as certain required witnesses, namely: (a) if prior to the amendment of R.A. 9165 by R.A. 10640, a representative from the media AND the Department of Justice (DOJ), AND any elected public official; or (b) if after the amendment of R.A. 9165 by R.A. 10640, an elected public official AND a representative of the National Prosecution Service OR the media. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The Court has held that the presence of the required number of witnesses at the time of the apprehension and inventory, is mandatory, and that their presence serves an essential purpose. (People vs. Arellaga, G.R. 231796, Aug. 24, 2020)

- To establish the identity of the dangerous drug with moral certainty, the prosecution must be able to account for each link of the chain of custody from the moment the drugs are seized up to their presentation in court as evidence of the crime. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

Illegal possession of dangerous drugs 
- In cases for illegal possession of dangerous drugs under R.A. 9165, it is essential that the identity of the dangerous drug be established with moral certainty, considering that the dangerous drug itself forms an integral part of the corpus delicti of the crime; failing to prove the integrity of the corpus delicti renders the evidence for the State insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt which therefore warrants an acquittal. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

- To convict an accused for illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the necessary elements thereof, to wit: (a) the accused was in possession of an item or object identified as a prohibited drug; (b) such possession was not authorized by law; and (c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the said drug. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

- To qualify possession of illegal drugs as warranting the imposition of stiffer penalties pursuant to Section 13, Article II of R.A. 9165, with which petitioners were charged, such possession must have occurred: (a) during a party; or (b) at a social gathering or meeting; or (c) in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons. (Plan, Jr., @ "Jun", et al. vs. People, G.R. 247589, Aug. 24, 2020)

Illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs 
- To secure a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs under Section 5, Article II of R.A. 9165, the prosecution must establish the following elements: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the sale and its consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor. (People vs. Arellaga, G.R. 231796, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### CONJUGAL PARTNERSHIP OF GAINS

Property regime of 
- Article 116 of the Family Code is explicit as to who has the burden to prove that property acquired during the marriage is not conjugal; a rebuttable presumption is established in Article 116 and the party who invokes that presumption must first establish that the property was acquired during the marriage because the proof of acquisition during the marriage is a condition sine qua non for the operation of the presumption in favor of the conjugal partnership. (Spouses Anastacio, Sr. vs. Heirs of the Late Spouses Juan F. Coloma and Juliana Parazo, G.R. 224572, Aug. 27, 2020)


- It is not necessary to prove that the property was acquired with conjugal funds and the presumption still applies even when the manner in which the property was acquired does not appear; once the condition sine qua non is established, then the presumption that all properties acquired during the marriage, whether the acquisition appears to have been made, contracted or registered in the name of one spouse or both spouses, are conjugal, remains until the contrary is proved. (Spouses Anastacio, Sr. vs. Heirs of the Late Spouses Juan F. Coloma and Juliana Parazo, G.R. 224572, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### CONSPIRACY

Existence of 
- Conspiracy is present when there is unity in purpose and intention in the commission of a crime; it does not require a previous plan or agreement to commit assault as it is sufficient that at the time of such aggression, all the accused manifested by their acts a common intent or desire to attack. (PO1 Delos Santos vs. People, et al., G.R. 231765, Aug. 24, 2020)

- It does not need to be proven by direct evidence and may be inferred from the conduct before, during, and after the commission of the crime indicative of a joint purpose, concerted action, and concurrence of sentiments as in conspiracy. (PO1 Delos Santos vs. People, et al., G.R. 231765, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Mere presence at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission is not, by itself, sufficient to establish conspiracy in the absence of evidence of actual cooperation rather than mere cognizance or approval of an illegal act is required; although direct proof is not essential to establish conspiracy, there must be positive and conclusive evidence which must satisfy the same degree of proof necessary to establish the crime to support a finding of the presence of a criminal conspiracy. (PO1 Delos Santos vs. People, et al., G.R. 231765, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### CONTRACTS

Acceleration clause 
- Acceleration clauses in loans for a fixed term give creditors a choice to: (1) defer collection of any unpaid amounts until the period ends; or (2) invoke the clause and collect the entire demandable amount immediately; this right to choose is meaningless if the obligation is made demandable only when the term expires. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

- An acceleration clause is a provision in a contract wherein, should the debtor default, the entire obligation shall become due and demandable; this Court has held that acceleration clauses are valid and produce legal effect. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

Compromise agreement 
- As provided by the law on contracts, a valid compromise must have the following elements: (1) the consent of the parties to the compromise, (2) an object certain that is the subject matter of the compromise, and (3) the cause of the obligation that is established. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

- In Magbanua v. Uy, the Court explained thus: The issue involving the validity of a compromise agreement notwithstanding a final judgment is not novel; Jesalva v. Bautista upheld a compromise agreement that covered cases pending trial, on appeal, and with final judgment; the Court noted that Article 2040 (of the Civil Code) impliedly allowed such agreements; there was no limitation as to when these should be entered into. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The rule of long standing is that rights may be waived or modified through a compromise agreement even after a final judgment has already settled the rights of the contracting parties; the compromise, to be binding, must be shown to have been voluntarily, freely and intelligently executed by the parties, who had full knowledge of the judgment. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

Consent 
- Under Article 1323 of the Civil Code, an offer becomes ineffective upon the death, civil interdiction, insanity, or insolvency of either party before acceptance is conveyed. (Spouses Anastacio, Sr. vs. Heirs of the Late Spouses Juan F. Coloma and Juliana Parazo, G.R. 224572, Aug. 27, 2020)

Effect of 
- Obligations arising from contracts have the force of law between the parties and should be complied with in good faith; respondents who freely signed the real estate mortgage contract cannot be allowed to renege on their obligation, as the validity or compliance of a contract cannot be left to the will of one of the parties. (The Commoner Lending Corporation, represented by Ma. Nory Alcala vs. Spouses Villanueva, G.R. 235260, Aug. 27, 2020)

Interpretation of 
- It is settled that the literal meaning shall govern when the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt as to the intention of the parties; the courts have no authority to alter the agreement or to make a new contract for the parties; their duty is confined to the interpretation of the terms and conditions which the parties have made for themselves without regard to their wisdom or folly. (The Commoner Lending Corporation, represented by Ma. Nory Alcala vs. Spouses Villanueva, G.R. 235260, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The courts cannot supply material stipulations or read into the contract words which it does not contain; it is only when the contract is vague and ambiguous that the courts are permitted to interpret the agreement and determine the intention of the parties. (The Commoner Lending Corporation, represented by Ma. Nory Alcala vs. Spouses Villanueva, G.R. 235260, Aug. 27, 2020)

Rescission of 
- Rescission unmakes a contract; the rights and obligations emanating from a rescinded contract are extinguished; being a mode of nullifying contracts and their correlative rights and obligations, rescission thus must be conveyed in an unequivocal manner and couched in unmistakable terms. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### COURT PERSONNEL

Dishonesty 
- Dishonesty means "a disposition to lie, cheat, deceive or defraud; untrustworthiness; lack of integrity, lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; lack of fairness and straightforwardness; disposition to defraud, deceive or betray." (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

Dishonesty, falsification of public documents, and misconduct 
- Making handwritten entries on the DTR of another who consented to it amounts to serious dishonesty, falsification of public documents, and misconduct. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

Duties 
- In Arabani, Jr. v. Arabani, the Court held that office hours should be devoted to the performance of official functions; Section 1, Canon IV of the CCCP provides that court personnel shall at all times perform official duties properly and with diligence; they shall commit themselves exclusively to the business and responsibilities of their office during working hours. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

- In Samonte v. Roden, the Court held that court employees must reflect their true arrival and departure times in the DTR, and must do so personally. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

Incompetence 
- A stenographer who already forgot stenography without doing anything to regain her skill is guilty of incompetence. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

Liability of 
- Violation of Section 3, Canon IV of the CCCP, which states that court personnel shall not alter, falsify, destroy or mutilate any record within their control; this includes the DTR. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

Misconduct 
- Misconduct is a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public officer; it is intentional wrongdoing or deliberate violation of a rule of law or standard of behavior and to constitute an administrative offense, the misconduct should relate to or be connected with the performance of the official functions and duties of a public officer. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

Primary employment 
- Section 5, Canon III of the Code of Conduct for Court Personnel (CCCP) which provides: SEC. 5. The full-time position in the Judiciary of every court personnel shall be the personnel's primary employment; for purposes of this Code, ‘primary employment' means the position that consumes the entire normal working hours of the court personnel and requires the personnel's exclusive attention in performing official duties. (Anonymous Complaint Against Clerk of Court V Atty. Zenalfie M. Cuenco, et al., A.M. No. P-10-2812 [formerly OCA IPI No. 10-420-P], Aug. 18, 2020)

#### COURTS

Hierarchy of courts 
- Direct resort to the Court in violation of the doctrine of hierarchy of courts is a sufficient cause for dismissal of the complaint; while it is true that in The Diocese of Bacolod v. Commission on Elections we have recognized exceptions to this doctrine, we have clarified in Gios Samar, Inc. v. Department of Transportation and Communications that it is not the presence of one or more of the so-called "special and important reasons," but the nature of the question raised by the parties in those "exceptions," which is "the decisive factor considered by the Court in deciding whether to permit the invocation, at the first instance, of its original jurisdiction over the issuance of extraordinary writs." (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals, and should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for petitions for the extraordinary writs; a becoming regard for that judicial hierarchy most certainly indicates that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level ("inferior") courts should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and those against the latter, with the Court of Appeals; a direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue these writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

Demurrer to evidence 
- A demurrer to evidence is defined as an objection by one of the parties in an action, to the effect that the evidence which his adversary produced is insufficient in point of law, whether true or not, to make out a case or sustain the issue; the party demurring challenges the sufficiency of the whole evidence to sustain a verdict. (JCLV Realty & Development Corporation vs. Mangali, G.R. 236618, Aug. 27, 2020)

Double jeopardy 
- It attaches when the following elements concur: (1) the accused is charged under a complaint or information sufficient in form and substance to sustain their conviction; (2) the court has jurisdiction; (3) the accused has been arraigned and has pleaded; and (4) the accused is convicted or acquitted, or the case is dismissed without his/her consent; here, all the elements are present. (JCLV Realty & Development Corporation vs. Mangali, G.R. 236618, Aug. 27, 2020)

Information 
- Qualifying circumstances must be properly pleaded in the indictment; if the same are not pleaded but proved, they shall be considered only as aggravating circumstances since the latter admit of proof even if not pleaded; it would be a denial of the right of the accused to be informed of the charges against him and consequently, a denial of due process, if he is charged with simple rape and convicted of its qualified form, although the attendant circumstance qualifying the offense and resulting in the capital punishment was not alleged in the indictment on which he was arraigned. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The rules require the qualifying circumstances to be specifically alleged in the Information in order to comply with the constitutional right of the accused to be properly informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him; the purpose is to allow the accused to prepare fully for his defense to prevent surprises during the trial. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

Prosecution of offenses 
- Date of commission of the offense; not essential to be alleged in the information with ultimate precision; convicting an accused of an offense committed outside the period alleged in the information is a violation of the accused's constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of accusation against him. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Section 8, Rule 110 of the Rules expressly require that: Section 8. Designation of the offense. - The complaint or information shall state the designation of the offense given by the statute, aver the acts or omissions constituting the offense, and specify its qualifying and aggravating circumstances; if there is no designation of the offense, reference shall be made to the section or subsection of the statute punishing it. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### DAMAGES

Attorney's fees 
- Article 111 of the Labor Code states that attorney's fees equivalent to 10 percent  of the amount of wages recovered may be assessed on the culpable party. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

- Attorney's fees awarded because exemplary damages were awarded and due to the length of the proceedings. (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

Exemplary Damages 
- Article 2232 of the Civil Code provides that in a contractual or quasi-contractual relationship, exemplary damages may be awarded only if the defendant had acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner; Article 2234 of the Civil Code further requires that, to be entitled to exemplary damages, the claimant must show that he is entitled to moral, temperate, or compensatory damages. (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Exemplary damages are recoverable when the dismissal was done in a wanton, oppressive, or malevolent manner. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

Moral damages 
- Moral damages are recoverable when the dismissal of an employee is attended by bad faith or fraud or constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

#### DENIAL AND ALIBI

Defenses of 
- Denial is inherently a weak defense which cannot outweigh positive testimony; a categorical statement that has the earmarks of truth prevails over a bare denial which can easily be fabricated and is inherently unreliable; for the defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove that he was at some other place at the time of the commission of the crime and it was physically impossible for him to be at the locus delicti or within its immediate vicinity. (People vs. Manlolo, G.R. 227841, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Disinterested witnesses must corroborate the defense of alibi, otherwise, it is fatal to the accused; relatives can hardly be categorized as disinterested witnesses; the defense of alibi may not prosper if it is established mainly by the appellant himself and his relatives, and not by credible persons. (People vs. Manlolo, G.R. 227841, Aug. 19, 2020)

- If found credible, the defenses of denial and alibi may, and should, be considered complete and legitimate defenses; the burden of proof does not shift by the mere invocation of said defenses; the presumption of innocence remains in favor of the accused. (People vs. Agaton, G.R. 251631, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Petitioner's defense of denial cannot be given more weight over the positive identification of eyewitnesses; for the defense of alibi to prosper, the appellant (petitioner) must prove that he was somewhere else when the offense was committed and that he was so far away that it was not possible for him to have been physically present at the place of the crime or at its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Since the prosecution was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused-appellant committed the crime, the latter's denial and alibi cannot be considered by this Court, especially in light of the positive identification of AAA; denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which can easily be concocted and fabricated. (People vs. Evardone, G.R. 248204, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The Court has constantly decreed that both denial and alibi are inherently weak defenses which cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witness that the accused committed the crime; between a categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a mere denial on the other, the former is generally held to prevail. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT OF 1990 (R.A. 6975)

Application of 
- According to the Philippine National Police, reasonableness of the force employed depends on the following criteria: the reasonableness of the force employed will depend upon the number of aggressors, nature and characteristic of the weapon used, physical condition, size and other circumstances to include the place and occasion of the assault; the police officer is given the sound discretion to consider these factors in employing reasonable force; the use of firearms by police is more strictly regulated; the danger of death or injury to the police officer or other persons must be imminent to justify resort to firearms. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Armed by the government and given the authority to use firearms, police officers are taught "schemes, strategies and plans on how to approach danger"; depending on the situation, police officers may be authorized to use force to enforce laws, as long as the force used is necessary and not excessive; when there is a confrontation between law enforcement and a suspect, the police's use of force should be reasonable and proportionate to the threat as perceived by the officers at that time. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### DUE PROCESS

Violation of 
- Considering the non-observance of petitioners' right to due process, the same should be set aside; it is settled that "violation of due process rights is a jurisdictional defect" and that "a decision or judgment is fatally defective if rendered in violation of a party-litigant's right to due process." (Ablong, et al. vs. Commission on Audit, G.R. 233308, Aug. 18, 2020)

#### EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP

Power of control 
- In labor law, one who exercises the power of control over the means, methods, and manner of performing an employee's work is considered as the employer; the power of the employer to control the work of the employee is considered the most significant determinant of the existence of an employer-employee relationship. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

- This test is premised on whether the person for whom the services are performed reserves the right to control both the end achieved and the manner and means used to achieve that end. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

#### EMPLOYMENT, TERMINATION OF

Computation of backwages and separation pay —In computing for backwages and separation pay, we follow Genuino Agro-Industrial Development Corp. v. Romano; under Article 279 (now Article 294) of the Labor Code, backwages is computed from the time of dismissal until the employee's reinstatement; however, when separation pay is ordered in lieu of reinstatement, backwages is computed from the time of dismissal until the finality of the decision ordering separation pay. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

Illegal dismissal 
- Established when the dismissal was without just or authorized cause and due process was not observed. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

- Law and jurisprudence laid down the monetary awards that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to: first, the renumbered Article 294 of the Labor Code formerly Article 279, states that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to backwages from the time compensation was withheld. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

- Law and jurisprudence laid down the monetary awards that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to: first, the renumbered Article 294 of the Labor Code, formerly Article 279, states that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to backwages; second, separation pay is warranted when the cause for termination is not attributable to the employee's fault, such as those provided in Articles 298 to 299 of the Labor Code, as well as in cases of illegal dismissal where reinstatement is no longer feasible. (Bayview Management Consultants, Inc., et al. vs. Pre, G.R. 220170, Aug. 19, 2020)

Loss of trust and confidence 
- In Cadavas v. Court of Appeals, We have emphasized that "loss of trust and confidence to be a valid cause for dismissal must be based on a willful breach of trust and founded on clearly established facts; such breach is willful if it is done intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse as distinguished from an act done carelessly, thoughtlessly, heedlessly or inadvertently." (San Miguel Corporation vs. Gomez, G.R. 200815, Aug. 24, 2020)

- In Matis v. Manila Electric Co., We have pointed out that "loss of confidence as a ground for dismissal has never been intended to afford an occasion for abuse by the employer of its prerogative, as it can easily be subject to abuse because of its subjective nature." (San Miguel Corporation vs. Gomez, G.R. 200815, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The loss of confidence must be genuine and cannot be used as a "subterfuge for causes which are improper, illegal or unjustified." (San Miguel Corporation vs. Gomez, G.R. 200815, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The requisites for dismissal on the ground of loss of trust and confidence are: "1) the employee concerned must be holding a position of trust and confidence; (2) there must be an act that would justify the loss of trust and confidence; and (3) such loss of trust relates to the employee's performance of duties." (San Miguel Corporation vs. Gomez, G.R. 200815, Aug. 24, 2020)

- What constitutes a "position of trust and confidence": loss of confidence should ideally apply only to cases involving employees occupying positions of trust and confidence or to those situations where the employee is routinely charged with the care and custody of the employer's money or property; to the first class belong managerial employees, i.e., those vested with the powers or prerogatives to lay down management policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline employees or effectively recommend such managerial actions; and to the second class belong cashiers, auditors, property custodians, etc., or those who, in the normal and routine exercise of their functions, regularly handle significant amounts of money or property. (San Miguel Corporation vs. Gomez, G.R. 200815, Aug. 24, 2020)

Separation pay 
- Anent the computation of separation pay, the same shall be equivalent to one month salary for every year of service and should not go beyond the date an employee was deemed to have been actually separated from employment, or beyond the date when reinstatement was rendered impossible. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

- Separation pay is warranted when the cause for termination is not attributable to the employee's fault, such as those provided in Articles 298 to 299 of the renumbered Labor Code, as well as in cases of illegal dismissal where reinstatement is no longer feasible. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

#### EMPLOYMENT, TYPES OF

Regular employment 
- Employees who perform tasks that are desirable and necessary to the business of the employer are regular employees. (Inocentes, Jr., et al. vs. R. Syjuco Construction, Inc. (RSCI), et al., G.R. 240549, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### EQUITY

Principle of 
- We have often ruled, equity, which has been aptly described as "justice outside legality," is only applied in the absence of, and never against statutory law or judicial rules of procedure. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### ESTOPPEL

Principle of 
- Pursuant to Article 1431 of the Civil Code, through estoppel an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon the party making it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person relying thereon"; Article 1433, in turn, classifies estoppel as either in pais (by conduct) or by deed; the classification is based on the common classification of estoppels into equitable and technical estoppel. (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al., G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### EVIDENCE

Admission of 
- The entry in the birth certificate that accused-appellant was the father of private complainant is not conclusive and evidence may be presented to disprove the same; the evidence here came in the form of a judicial admission which conclusively binds the party making it; he cannot thereafter take a position contradictory to, or inconsistent with his pleadings; acts or facts admitted do not require proof and cannot be contradicted unless it is shown that the admission was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was made. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

Affidavits of desistance 
- It is well-settled that the Court frowns upon affidavits of desistance or recantation made after conviction of the accused; these affidavits deserve scant consideration. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 239906, Aug. 26, 2020)

Allegations of forgery 
- It is well-settled that allegations of forgery, like all other allegations, must be proved by clear, positive, and convincing evidence by the party alleging it; it should not be presumed but must be established by comparing the alleged forged signature with the genuine signatures. (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

Burden of proof 
- By strong evidence of guilt, the law contemplates more than evidence that engenders a belief that a crime has probably been committed and that it has been committed by the accused; however, it is less than evidence beyond reasonable doubt, but rather evident guilt or a great presumption of guilt such as would lead a dispassionate judge to conclude that the offense has been committed as charged, that accused is the guilty agent, and that accused will probably be meted the capital punishment. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- In all civil litigations, the burden of proof lies in the party who asserts, not in the party who denies because the latter, by the nature of things, cannot produce any proof of the assertion denied; party making an allegation has the burden of proving the allegation by preponderance of evidence. (Esguerra, substituted by her Heirs vs. Spouses Ignacio, et al., G.R. 216597, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The rule on burden of proof in illegal dismissal cases cannot be unduly applied in proving whether a seafarer was repatriated for medical reasons; the nature of things is that one who denies a fact cannot produce any proof of it. (Maryville Manila, Inc. vs. Espinosa, G.R. 229372, Aug. 27, 2020)

Circumstantial evidence 
- Direct evidence is not the sole means of establishing guilt beyond reasonable doubt because circumstantial evidence, if sufficient, can supplant the absence of direct evidence. (People vs. Soria, G.R. 248372, Aug. 27, 2020)

- For circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to support a conviction, all the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is innocent, and with every other rational hypothesis except that of guilt. (People vs. Soria, G.R. 248372, Aug. 27, 2020)

- To sustain a conviction based on circumstantial evidence, three requisites must be established: first, there is more than one circumstance; second, the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and third, the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt. (People vs. Soria, G.R. 248372, Aug. 27, 2020)

Extrajudicial confession 
- In People v. Domantay, where the accused was also interviewed while inside a jail cell, this Court held that such circumstance alone does not taint the extrajudicial confession of the accused, especially since the same was given freely and spontaneously; following this Court's ruling in People v. Jerez, the details surrounding the commission of the crime, which could be supplied only by the accused, and the spontaneity and coherence exhibited by him during his interviews, belie any insinuation of duress that would render his confession inadmissible. (People vs. Soria, G.R. 248372, Aug. 27, 2020)

Preponderance of evidence 
- Preponderance of evidence is the weight, credit, and value of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually considered to be synonymous with the term "greater weight of evidence" or "greater weight of credible evidence." (Esguerra, substituted by her Heirs vs. Spouses Ignacio, et al., G.R. 216597, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### FORECLOSURE

Extrajudicial foreclosure 
- In extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage, a special power to sell the property is required which must be either inserted in or attached to the deed of mortgage; apropos is Section 1 of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, thus: Section 1. When a sale is made under a special power inserted in or attached to any real estate mortgage hereafter made as security for the payment of money or the fulfillment of any other obligation, the provisions of the following section shall govern as to the manner in which the sale and redemption shall be effected, whether or not provision for the same is made in the power. (The Commoner Lending Corporation, represented by Ma. Nory Alcala vs. Spouses Villanueva, G.R. 235260, Aug. 27, 2020)

- While a power of sale will not be recognized as contained in mortgage unless it is given by express grant and in clear and explicit terms, and that there can be no implied power of sale where a mortgage holds by a deed absolute in form, it is generally held that no particular formality is required in the creation of the power of sale, as any words are sufficient which evince an intention that the sale may be made upon default or other contingency. (The Commoner Lending Corporation, represented by Ma. Nory Alcala vs. Spouses Villanueva, G.R. 235260, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### FORUM SHOPPING

Existence of 
- It exists when, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion in another, or when he institutes two or more actions or proceedings grounded on the same cause, on the gamble that one or the other court would make a favorable disposition. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The act of deliberate and willful forum shopping warrants the summary dismissal with prejudice of the instant Petition and all other cases pending in the lower courts, if any; by abusing court processes, forum shopping constitutes direct contempt of this Court. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### HOUSING AND LAND USE REGULATORY BOARD (HLURB)

Jurisdiction 
- Its precursor, the National Housing Authority (NHA), was vested under P.D. No. 957 with exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the real estate trade and business; the NHA's jurisdiction was expanded under Section 1 of P.D. No. 1344 to include adjudication of the following cases: (a) unsound real estate business practices; (b) claims involving refund and any other claims filed by subdivision lot or condominium unit buyer against the project owner, developer, dealer, broker or salesman; and (c) cases involving specific performance of contractual and statutory obligations filed by buyers of subdivision lot or condominium unit against the owner, developer, broker or salesman. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The cases before the HLURB must involve a subdivision project, subdivision lot, condominium project or condominium unit, and its jurisdiction is limited to those cases filed by the buyer or owner of a subdivision or condominium based on any of the causes enumerated under the law. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Unsound real estate business practices; the policy of the law is to curb the unscrupulous practices of the subdivision owner and developer in real estate trade and business that will prejudice the buyers, and one who is found guilty of unsound real estate business practices is liable to pay fines and damages; the policy of P.D. No. 1344 is to curb the unscrupulous practices of the subdivision owner and developer in real estate trade and business that will prejudice the buyers. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ACT OF 1997 (R.A. 8371)

National Commission on Indigenous People (NCIP) 
- A careful review of Section 66 shows that the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/IPs only when they arise between or among parties belonging to the same ICC/IP. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Certification shall be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that the same has not been resolved, which certification shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP; the qualifying provision requires two conditions before such disputes may be brought before the NCIP, namely: (1) exhaustion of remedies under customary laws of the parties, and (2) compliance with condition precedent through the said certification by the Council of Elders/Leaders. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- In Unduran v. Aberasturi, it was held that the jurisdiction of the NCIP under Section 66 of the IPRA over claims and disputes involving rights of indigenous cultural communities (ICCs) and indigenous peoples (IPs) arises only when such claims or disputes are between or among parties who belong to the same ICC/IP. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The NCIP has primary jurisdiction over cases where one of the parties is not a ICC/IPs or the parties are from different ICCs/IP under the following provisions of the IPRA: (1) Section 52(h) of the IPRA anent the power of the NCIP Ancestral Domain Office (ADO) to deny application for Certificate of Ancestral Domain Titles (CADTs), in relation to Section 62, regarding the power of the NCIP to hear and decide unresolved adverse claims; (2) Section 53 on the NCIP-ADO's power to deny applications for Certificate CALTs and on the NCIP's power to grant meritorious claims and resolve conflicting claims; and (3) Section 54 as to the power of the NCIP to resolve fraudulent claims over ancestral domains and lands. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### INSURANCE

Contract of 
- A contract of insurance is defined as an agreement whereby one undertakes for a consideration to indemnify another against loss, damage, or liability arising from an unknown or contingent event. (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

- An insurance contract exists where the following elements concur: (1) the insured has an insurable interest; (2) the insured is subject to a risk of loss by the happening of the designated peril; (3) the insurer assumes the risk; (4) such assumption of risk is part of a general scheme to distribute actual losses among a large group of persons bearing a similar risk; and (5) in consideration of the insurer's promise, the insured pays a premium. (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Contracts of insurance must be construed according to the sense and meaning of the terms which the parties themselves have used; if the provisions are clear and unambiguous, they must be taken and understood in their plain, ordinary and popular sense; this is consistent with the cardinal rule of interpretation that "if the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control." (Integrated Micro Electronics, Inc. vs. Standard Insurance Co., Inc., G.R. 210302, Aug. 27, 2020)

- In the case of Perez v. Court of Appeals, the Court held that assent is given when the insurer issues a corresponding policy to the applicant; the Court declared that "it is only when the applicant pays the premium and receives and accepts the policy while he is in good health that the contract of insurance is deemed to have been perfected." (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### INTEREST

Award of 
- Applying the guidelines in Nacar to the present case, 12 percent  interest rate per annum shall be imposed on the principal amount due from the time of judicial demand, i.e., from the time of the filing of the complaint, until June 30, 2013; from July 1, 2013, until full satisfaction of the monetary award, the interest rate shall be 6 percent  per annum. (Loyola Life Plans Incorporated (now Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc.), et al. vs. ATR Professional life Assurance Corporation (now Asian Life and General Assurance Corporation), G.R. 228402, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### INTERVENTION

Complaint for 
- In general, an independent controversy cannot be injected into a suit by intervention, hence, such intervention will not be allowed where it would enlarge the issues in the action and expand the scope of the remedies; it is not proper where there are certain facts giving the intervenor's case an aspect peculiar to himself and differentiating it clearly from that of the original parties; the proper course is for the would-be intervenor to litigate his claim in a separate suit. (Tirol vs. Nolasco, G.R. 230103, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Intervention is not intended to change the nature and character of the action itself, or to stop or delay the placid operation of the machinery of the trial; the remedy of intervention is not proper where it will have the effect of retarding the principal suit or delaying the trial of the action. (Tirol vs. Nolasco, G.R. 230103, Aug. 27, 2020)


- It can be readily seen that intervention is not a matter of right, but is left to the trial court's sound discretion; the trial court must not only determine if the requisite legal interest is present, but also take into consideration the delay and the consequent prejudice to the original parties that the intervention will cause. 

- The Court in Ongco v. Dalisay described intervention as a remedy, as follows: Intervention is a remedy by which a third party, not originally impleaded in the proceedings, becomes a litigant therein for a certain purpose: to enable the third party to protect or preserve a right or interest that may be affected by those proceedings. (Tirol vs. Nolasco, G.R. 230103, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### JUDGMENTS

Compromise judgments 
- A compromise judgment is a decision rendered by a court sanctioning the agreement between the parties concerning the determination of the controversy at hand; it is a contract, stamped with judicial imprimatur, between two or more persons, who, for preventing or putting an end to a lawsuit, adjust their difficulties by mutual consent in the manner which they agree on, and which each of them prefers in the hope of gaining, balanced by the danger of losing. (Unirock Corporation, as represented by Edison U. Ojerio vs. Carpio, et al., G.R. 213421, Aug. 24, 2020)

- A final judgment based on compromise agreement has the same force and effect of a final judgment on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction, and is, thus, subject to the same prevailing principles on compromise agreements after final judgment. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

- A judgment based on compromise is not appealable; it should not be disturbed except upon a showing of vitiated consent or forgery; the reason for the rule is that when both parties enter into an agreement to end a pending litigation and request that a decision be rendered approving said agreement, it is only natural to presume that such action constitutes an implicit, as undeniable as an express, waiver of the right to appeal against said decision. (Unirock Corporation, as represented by Edison U. Ojerio vs. Carpio, et al., G.R. 213421, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Decision on a compromise agreement is final and executory, and is conclusive between the parties; upon court approval of a compromise agreement, it transcends its identity as a mere contract binding only upon the parties thereto, as it becomes a judgment that is subject to execution in accordance with Rule 39 of the Rules of Court; it should not be disturbed except upon a showing of vitiated consent or forgery. (Unirock Corporation, as represented by Edison U. Ojerio vs. Carpio, et al., G.R. 213421, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The inability of petitioner to enforce its ownership rights as against the respondent, which had unduly exploited petitioner's properties, but failed to pay the corresponding royalties as agreed upon, would result in unjustness and inequity. (Unirock Corporation, as represented by Edison U. Ojerio vs. Carpio, et al., G.R. 213421, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Upon court approval of a compromise agreement, it transcends its identity as a mere contract binding only upon the parties thereto, as it becomes a judgment that is subject to execution in accordance with Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. (Unirock Corporation, as represented by Edison U. Ojerio vs. Carpio, et al., G.R. 213421, Aug. 24, 2020)

Dispositive portion 
- It is settled that where there is a conflict between the dispositive part and the opinion of the court contained in the text or body of the decision, the former must prevail over the latter on the theory that the dispositive portion is the final order, while the opinion is merely a statement ordering nothing. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Light Rail Transit Authority v. Court of Appeals declares that "it is the dispositive part of the judgment that actually settles and declares the rights and obligations of the parties, finally, definitively, and authoritatively, notwithstanding the existence of inconsistent statements in the body that may tend to confuse"; it must be borne in mind "that execution must conform to that ordained or decreed in the dispositive part of the decision; consequently, where the order of execution is not in harmony with and exceeds the judgment which gives it life, the order has pro-tanto no validity." (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

- While the body of the decision, order or resolution might create some ambiguity in the manner the court's reasoning preponderates, it is the dispositive portion thereof that finally invests rights upon the parties, sets conditions for the exercise of those rights, and imposes the corresponding duties or obligations. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

Execution of 
- A writ of execution may be stayed or quashed when "facts and circumstances transpire" after judgment has been rendered that would make "execution impossible or unjust"; another exception is when the writ of execution alters or varies the judgment; a writ of execution derives its validity from the judgment it seeks to enforce. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

- In Chiquita Brands, Inc. v. Omelio, the execution of a final judgment may be stayed or set aside in certain cases; "courts have jurisdiction to entertain motions to quash previously issued writs of execution"; they "have the inherent power, for the advancement of justice, to correct the errors of their ministerial officers and to control their own processes." (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

Judgment in criminal case 
- Time and again, the Court has invariably held that although the judge who rendered judgment in a criminal case was not the same judge who heard the case, there is nothing to preclude the former from ascertaining complainant's credibility based on the case records. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

Judgment of acquittal 
- A judgment of acquittal, whether ordered by the trial or the appellate court, is final, unappealable, and immediately executory upon its promulgation. (People vs. Arcega, G.R. 237489, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The case of People v. Hon. Velasco provides the reason for such rule, to wit: The fundamental philosophy highlighting the finality of an acquittal by the trial court cuts deep into "the humanity of the laws and in a jealous watchfulness over the rights of the citizen, when brought in unequal contest with the State." (People vs. Arcega, G.R. 237489, Aug. 27, 2020)

Judgments of lower courts 
- Decisions of lower courts or other divisions of the same court are not binding on others; no grave abuse of discretion is committed when a judge sets aside an earlier ruling rendered by the previous judge in the same trial court branch for the same case, especially when, as in this case, a reversible error had been committed. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT

Judicial review 
- An actual case or controversy is "one which involves a conflict of legal rights, an assertion of opposite legal claims susceptible of judicial resolution"; a case is justiciable if the issues presented are "definite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests"; the conflict must be ripe for judicial determination, not conjectural or anticipatory; otherwise, this Court's decision will amount to an advisory opinion concerning legislative or executive action. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Determining whether the act under review is quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial is necessary in determining when judicial remedies may properly be availed of; rules issued in the exercise of an administrative agency's quasi-legislative power may be taken cognizance of by courts on the first instance as part of their judicial power. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- In David v. Arroyo, this Court summarized the requirements where taxpayers and concerned citizens have the legal standing to sue: (1) the cases involve constitutional issues; (2) for taxpayers, there must be a claim of illegal disbursement of public funds or that the tax measure is unconstitutional; (3) for voters, there must be a showing of obvious interest in the validity of the election law in question; (4) for concerned citizens, there must be a showing that the issues raised are of transcendental importance which must be settled early; and (5) for legislators, there must be a claim that the social action complained of infringes upon their prerogatives as legislators. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- In Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. DOLE: As a rule, "the constitutionality of a statute will be passed on only if and to the extent that, it is directly and necessarily involved in a justiciable controversy and is essential to the protection of the rights of the parties concerned"; a controversy is said to be justiciable if: first, there is an actual case or controversy involving legal rights that are capable of judicial determination; second, the parties raising the issue must have standing or locus standi to raise the constitutional issue; third, the constitutionality must be raised at the earliest opportunity; and fourth, resolving the constitutionality must be essential to the disposition of the case. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- In Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines (PBOAP) v. DOLE, this Court laid out the distinction between quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative acts and the requirements of judicial review for each one: administrative actions reviewable by this Court, therefore, may either be quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial; quasi-legislative or rule-making power is the power of an administrative agency to make rules and regulations that have the force and effect of law so long as they are issued "within the confines of the granting statute"; quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory power is "the power to hear and determine questions of fact to which the legislative policy is to apply and to decide in accordance with the standards laid down by the law itself in enforcing and administering the same law"; the constitutional permissibility of the grant of quasi-judicial powers to administrative agencies has been likewise recognized by this Court. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- It is settled that courts have the jurisdiction to resolve actual cases or controversies involving administrative actions done in the exercise of their quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative functions. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

- This Court held that in order for an association to have legal standing, it must establish the identity of its members, and present proof of its authority to bring the suit for and on behalf of its members. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### JURISDICTION

Concurrent jurisdiction 
- Although the Supreme Court, the CA, and the RTCs have concurrent original jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, and habeas corpus, parties are directed, as a rule, to file their petitions before the lower-ranked court. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

Jurisdiction over the subject matter 
- It is axiomatic that jurisdiction over the subject matter is conferred by law and not by the consent or acquiescence of any or all of the parties or by erroneous belief of the court that it exists; when a court or tribunal has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the only power it has is to dismiss the action. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Jurisdiction is defined as the power and authority to hear, try, and decide a case; in order for the court or an adjudicative body to have authority to dispose of the case on the merits, it must acquire jurisdiction over the subject matter. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Prior to Tijam, this Court already came up with an edifying rule in People v. Casiano on when jurisdiction by estoppel applies and when it does not: the operation of the principle of estoppel on the question of jurisdiction seemingly depends upon whether the lower court actually had jurisdiction or not; if it had no jurisdiction, but the case was tried and decided upon the theory that it had jurisdiction, the parties are not barred, on appeal, from assailing such jurisdiction, for the same "must exist as a matter of law, and may not be conferred by consent of the parties or by estoppel"; however, if the lower court had jurisdiction, and the case was heard and decided upon a given theory, such, for instance, as that the court had no jurisdiction, the party who induced it to adopt such theory will not be permitted, on appeal, to assume an inconsistent position, that the lower court had jurisdiction. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The cases of Spouses Martinez v. De la Merced, Marquez v. Secretary of Labor, Ducat v. Court of Appeals, Bayoca v. Nogales, Spouses Jimenez v. Patricia Inc., and Centeno v. Centeno all adhered to the doctrine that a party's active participation in the actual proceedings before a court without jurisdiction will bar him from assailing such lack of jurisdiction; on the other hand, the cases of Dy v. National Labor Relations Commission, De Rossi v. National Labor Relations Commission and Union Motors Corp. v. National Labor Relations Commission buttressed the rule that jurisdiction is conferred by law and lack of jurisdiction may be questioned at any time even on appeal. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The Court is guided by the following principle in determining the jurisdiction of the NCIP: jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case is conferred by law and determined by the allegations in the complaint which comprise a concise statement of the ultimate facts constituting the plaintiff's cause of action; the nature of an action, as well as which court or body has jurisdiction over it, is determined based on the allegations contained in the complaint of the plaintiff, irrespective of whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to recover upon all or some of the claims asserted therein. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The defense of lack of jurisdiction may be waived by estoppel but considering that the law apportioned the jurisdiction of courts and tribunals for the orderly administration of justice, the doctrine of estoppel must be applied with great care and only when strong equitable considerations are present. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The notion that the defense of lack of jurisdiction may be waived by estoppel on the party invoking it most prominently emerged in Tijam v. Sibonghanoy where the Supreme Court held that a party cannot invoke the jurisdiction of a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same jurisdiction. (Velasquez, Jr. vs. Lisondra Land Incorporated, Represented by Edwin L. Lisondra, G.R. 231290, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### JUVENILE JUSTICE AND WELFARE ACT OF 2006 (R.A. 9344)

Application of 
- Section 40 of R.A. 9344 provides that the same extends only until the child in conflict with the law reaches the maximum age of twenty-one (21) years old; in extending the application of R.A. 9344 to give meaning to the legislative intent of the said law, we ruled in People v. Jacinto, as cited in People v. Ancajas, that the promotion of the welfare of a child in conflict with the law should extend even to one who has exceeded the age limit of twenty-one (21) years, so long as he/she committed the crime when he/she was still a child. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### LABOR-ONLY CONTRACTING

Elements 
- Section 5 of DOLE Order No. 18-02 prohibits labor-only contracting and defines it as an arrangement where the contractor or subcontractor merely recruits, supplies or places workers to perform a job, work or service for a principal, and any of the following elements are present: 1) The contractor or subcontractor does not have substantial capital or investment which relates to the job, work or service to be performed and the employees recruited, supplied or placed by such contractor or subcontractor are performing activities which are directly related to the main business of the principal; or 2) the contractor does not exercise the right to control over the performance of the work of the contractual employee. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

#### LABOR RELATIONS

Constructive dismissal 
- The standard for constructive dismissal is "whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to give up his employment under the circumstances"; the unreasonably harsh conditions that compel resignation on the part of an employee must be way beyond the occasional discomforts brought about by the misunderstandings between the employer and employee. (Bayview Management Consultants, Inc., et al. vs. Pre, G.R. 220170, Aug. 19, 2020)

- There is constructive dismissal when an employer's act of clear discrimination, insensibility or disdain becomes so unbearable on the part of the employee so as to foreclose any choice on his part except to resign from such employment. (Bayview Management Consultants, Inc., et al. vs. Pre, G.R. 220170, Aug. 19, 2020)

Employer-employee relationship 
- The Court has consistently ruled that there is no hard and fast rule designed to establish the elements of an employer-employee relationship; some forms of evidence that have accepted to establish the elements include, but are not limited to, identification cards, cash vouchers, social security registration, appointment letters or employment contracts, payroll, organization charts, and personnel lists, among others. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020) 

- The elements are: 1) the selection and engagement of the employees; 2) the payment of wages; 3) the power of dismissal; and 4) the power to control the employee's conduct. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### LABOR STANDARDS

Benefits 
- Entitlement to benefits must be substantiated by the employees as a long established tradition or regular practice on the part of the employer, otherwise, they cannot be awarded. (Monsanto Philippines, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., G.R. Nos. 230609-10, Aug, 27, 2020)

Diminution of benefits 
- Generally, employees have a vested right over existing benefits that the employer voluntarily granted them; these benefits cannot be reduced, diminished, discontinued or eliminated consistent with the constitutional mandate to protect the rights of workers and promote their welfare. (Home Credit Mutual Building and Loan Association and/or Ronnie B. Alcantara vs. Prudente, G.R. 200010, Aug. 27, 2020)

- In labor cases, however, benefits which were voluntarily given by the employer, and which have ripened into company practice, are considered as rights and are subject to the non-diminution rule; to be considered a company practice, the benefit must be consistently and deliberately granted by the employer over a long period of time; it requires an indubitable showing that the employer agreed to continue giving the benefit knowing fully well that the employee is not covered by any provision of law or agreement for its payment; the burden to establish that the benefit has ripened into a company practice rests with the employee. (Home Credit Mutual Building and Loan Association and/or Ronnie B. Alcantara vs. Prudente, G.R. 200010, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The non-diminution rule applies only if the benefit is based on an express policy, a written contract, or has ripened into a practice; "practice" or "custom" is not a source of a legally demandable or enforceable right. (Home Credit Mutual Building and Loan Association and/or Ronnie B. Alcantara vs. Prudente, G.R. 200010, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### LACHES

Elements 
- The elements of laches are as follows: (1) conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom claims, giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made an[d] for which the complaint seeks a remedy; (2) delay in asserting the complainant's rights, the complainant having had knowledge or notice of the defendant's conduct and having been afforded an opportunity to institute a suit; (3) lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the complainant would assert the right on which he bases his suit; and (4) injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant, or the suit is not held to be barred. (Heirs of Isabelo Cudal, Sr., Represented by Libertad Cudal, et al. vs. Spouses Suguitan, Jr., G.R. 244405, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The four elements of the equitable defense of laches as held by the Court in Go Chi Gun v. Co Cho are: (1) conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made and for which the complaint seeks a remedy; (2) delay in asserting the complainant's rights, the complainant having had knowledge or notice of the defendant's conduct and having been afforded an opportunity to institute a suit; (3) lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the complainant would assert the right on which he bases his suit; and (4) injury or prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant, or the suit is not held to be barred. (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al, G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

Principle of 
- In a general sense, laches is the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier. (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al, G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

- In Republic v. Court of Appeals, where the title of an innocent purchaser for value who relied on the clean certificates of the title was sought to be cancelled and the excess land to be reverted to the Government, we ruled that "it is only fair and reasonable to apply the equitable principle of estoppel by laches against the government to avoid an injustice to innocent purchasers for value." (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al, G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

- It is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it; the doctrine of laches or of "stale demands" is based upon grounds of public policy which requires, for the peace of society, the discouragement of stale claims, and is not a mere question of time but is principally a question of the inequity or unfairness of permitting a right or claim to be enforced or asserted. (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al., G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

- There is laches when a party was negligent or has failed to assert a right within a reasonable time, thus giving rise to the presumption that he or she has abandoned it; laches has set in when it is already inequitable or unfair to allow the party to assert the right. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### LAND REGISTRATION

Torrens system 
- The party who seeks the protection of the Torrens system has the obligation to prove his good faith as a purchaser for value; this requirement should be applied without exception because only the IPV is insulated from any fraud perpetrated upon the registered owner which results in the latter being divested of his title (i.e., he loses ownership) to the contested property and recognizing the same in the name of the IPV. (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al, G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

Torrens title 
- It is basic that a certificate of title is merely an evidence of ownership, it cannot be used to protect a usurper from the true owner; nor can it be used as a shield for the commission of fraud, and its issuance in favor of a particular person does not foreclose the possibility that the real property may be owned by another person. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

- It is settled that a Torrens title cannot be altered, modified or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance with law; a direct proceeding is an action specifically to annul or set aside such judgment or enjoin its enforcement. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT

Delegation of legislative power 
- The enabling law must be complete, with sufficient standards to guide the administrative agency in exercising its rule-making power; as an exception to the rule on non-delegation of legislative power, administrative rules and regulations must be "germane to the objects and purposes of the law, and be not in contradiction to, but in conformity with, the standards prescribed by law." (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

Legislative franchise 
- At the onset, it is imperative to point out that based on our Constitution and laws, a legislative franchise is both a pre-requisite and a continuing requirement for broadcasting entities to broadcast their programs through television and radio stations in the country. (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- Broadly speaking, "a franchise is defined to be a special privilege to do certain things conferred by government on an individual or corporation, and which does not belong to citizens generally of common right." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- Insofar as the great powers of government are concerned, "a franchise is basically a legislative grant of a special privilege to a person"; in Associated Communications & Wireless Services v. NTC (Associated Communications), the Court defined a "franchise as the privilege granted by the State through its legislative body subject to regulation by the State itself by virtue of its police power through its administrative agencies." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution further states that "for the operation of a public utility," no "such franchise or right shall be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

#### LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 (R.A. 7160)

Barangay conciliation 
- Administrative Circular No. 14-93 enumerated the cases which are not covered by the mandatory barangay conciliation; subject to the said exemptions, a party's failure to comply with the requirement of prior barangay conciliation before filing a case in court would render his complaint dismissible on the ground of failure to comply with a condition precedent, pursuant to Section 1 (j), Rule 16 of the Rules of Court. (Ngo vs. Gabelo, et al., G.R. 207707, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, provides that barangay conciliation proceedings is a pre-condition to filing a complaint in court between persons actually residing in the same barangay to explore possible amicable settlement; the relevant provisions of R.A. 7160 in the conduct of barangay conciliation are provided under Article 409 on Venue and Article 412 on Conciliation. (Ngo vs. Gabelo, et al., G.R. 207707, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### MARRIAGES

Psychological incapacity 
- Although not an absolute and indispensable requirement, expert findings on psychological incapacity deserve great weight especially when corroborated by other pieces of evidence. (Calma vs. Santos-Calma, G.R. 242070, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Consistent with how the totality of evidence should ultimately inform any determination of whether a marriage should be declared void pursuant to Article 36 of the Family Code, as well as with judicial wisdom expressed in contemporary jurisprudence that has more keenly and openly understood the myriad manifestations of psychological incapacity, this Court finds that petitioner successfully discharged his burden of demonstrating respondent's psychological incapacity. (Calma vs. Santos-Calma, G.R. 242070, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Her lack of interest in social relationships though not as grave as the degree manifested in schizophrenia prevents her from developing strong attachments and from staying in relationships; her maladaptive behavioral patterns affect her impulse control and makes her susceptible to mood changes; this "invariably strains" her relationships and results in her lacking empathy and concern. (Calma vs. Santos-Calma, G.R. 242070, Aug. 24, 2020)

- "Psychological incapacity" should refer to no less than a mental (not physical) incapacity that causes a party to be truly incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage which, as so expressed by Article 68 of the Family Code, include their mutual obligations to live together, observe love, respect and fidelity and render help and support. (Calma vs. Santos-Calma, G.R. 242070, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The abandonment of one's family, extramarital affair, squandering of financial support, imploring for more money, indifference, and dejection are manifestations of a grave pyschological disorder and inability to fulfill essential marital obligations. (Calma vs. Santos-Calma, G.R. 242070, Aug. 24, 2020)

- There is hardly any doubt that the intendment of the law has been to confine the meaning of ''psychological incapacity" to the most serious cases of personality disorders clearly demonstrative of an utter insensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the marriage. (Calma vs. Santos-Calma, G.R. 242070, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### MOTIONS

Motion for reconsideration 
- A motion for reconsideration is among the remedies an aggrieved party may avail of against an adverse judgment or final order as provided for in Rule 37, Section 1 of the Rules of Court. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The purpose of a motion for reconsideration is for the moving party to point to purported errors in the assailed judgment or final order which that party views as unsupported by law or evidence; it "grants an opportunity for the court to correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by re-examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the case." (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

Motion to quash 
- As the Court explained in Limpin, Jr. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, although, as a general rule, no appeal lies from an order denying a motion to quash writ of execution, there are exceptions to this rule: 1) the writ of execution varies the judgment; 2) there has been a change in the situation of the parties making execution inequitable or unjust; 3) execution is sought to be enforced against property exempt from execution; 4) it appears that the controversy has never been submitted to the judgment of the court; 5) the terms of the judgment are not clear enough and there remains room for interpretation thereof; or, 6) it appears that the writ of execution has been improvidently issued, or that it is defective in substance, or is issued against the wrong party, or that the judgment debt has been paid or otherwise satisfied, or the writ was issued without authority. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

- From the denial of petitioners' first motion to quash, the proper remedy was not to file a second motion to quash, but to seek recourse to a higher court either by appeal (writ of error or certiorari) or by a special civil action of certiorari, prohibition, or mandamus, if warranted under exceptional circumstances established by jurisprudence and upon compliance with any prerequisite (e.g., filing of a motion for reconsideration) required by the Rules. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020) 

Omnibus motion rule 
- The spirit or rationale of the Omnibus Motion Rule under Section 8, Rule 15 of the Revised Rules of Civil Procedure is to require the movant to raise all available grounds for relief in a single opportunity in order to avoid multiple and piece-meal objections. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (NTC)

Certificate of public convenience 
- In Divinagracia v. Consolidated Broadcasting System, Inc. (Divinagracia), citing Associated Communications, this Court ruled that the legislative franchise requirement under Act No. 3846, as amended, was not repealed by the additional requirement imposed in P.D. No. 576-A; they co-exist. (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- In Divinagracia, it was explained that: Broadcast and television stations are required to obtain a legislative franchise, a requirement imposed by the Radio Control Act and affirmed by our ruling in Associated Broadcasting; after securing their legislative franchises, stations are required to obtain CPCs from the NTC before they can operate their radio or television broadcasting systems. Such requirement while traceable also to the Radio Control Act, currently find its basis in E.O. No. 546, the law establishing the NTC. (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- It has also been clarified in Associated Communications that a congressional franchise is required to operate radio, as well as television stations, in light of the subsequent issuance of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 576-A; Section 6 of P.D. No. 576-A further imposes, as an additional requirement to operate a radio or television station, an "authority" coming from "the Board of Communications and the Secretary of Public Works and Communications or their successors [(i.e., the NTC)] who have the right and authority to assign to qualified parties frequencies, channels or other means of identifying broadcasting systems." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

- With respect to the broadcast industry, Section 1 of Act No. 3846, as amended, clearly provides that "no person, firm, company, association or corporation shall construct, install, establish, or operate a radio station within the Philippine Islands without having first obtained a franchise therefor from the Philippine Legislature." (ABS-CBN Corporation vs. National Telecommunications Commission, G.R. 252119, Aug. 25, 2020)

#### NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS LAW

Crossed check 
- A crossed check is one where two parallel lines are drawn across its face or across its corner, and carries with it the following effects: (a) the check may not be encashed but only deposited in the bank; (b) the check may be negotiated only once to the one who has an account with the bank; and (c) the act of crossing the check serves as a warning to the holder that the check has been issued for a definite purpose and he must inquire if he received the check pursuant to this purpose; otherwise, he is not a holder in due course. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

Liability of the drawee bank in unauthorized payment of checks 
- It is settled that the collecting bank which reimbursed the drawee bank may in turn seek reimbursement from the persons who caused the checks to be deposited and received the unauthorized payments. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The drawee bank, or the bank on which a check is drawn, is bound by its contractual obligation to its client, the drawer, to pay the check only to the payee or to the payee's order; the drawee bank is duty-bound to follow strictly the instructions of its client, which is reflected on the face of, and by the terms of, the check. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The drawee bank, which merely relied upon the guarantee of the collecting bank, may seek reimbursement from the latter; a collecting bank is an endorser that assumes all the warranties under Section 66 of the Negotiable Intruments Law; the collecting bank, being the last endorser, is liable even if the previous endorsements were forged. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

- When the drawee bank pays a person other than the named payee on the check, the drawee bank violates its contractual obligation to its client; it shall be held liable for the amount charged to the drawer's account. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

Warranty of an indorser 
- A collecting bank where a check is deposited, and which endorses the check upon presentment with the drawee bank, is an endorser; under Section 66 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, an endorser warrants: (1) that the instrument is genuine and in all respects what it purports to be; (2) that the endorser has good title to it; (3) that all prior parties had capacity to contract; and (4) that the instrument is, at the time of the indorsement, valid and subsisting. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

- When a collecting bank presents a check to the drawee bank for payment, the former thereby assumes the same warranties assumed by an endorser of a negotiable instrument and if any of these warranties turn out to be false, the collecting bank becomes liable to the drawee bank for the payments made under these false warranties. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Co. vs. Junnel's Marketing Corporation, et al., G.R. 232044, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### NOTARIES PUBLIC

Duties 
- Settled is the rule that a notary public must not notarize a document unless the persons who signed it are the very same persons who executed the same, and personally appeared before him to attest to the truth of the contents thereof. (Jayme vs. Jayme, et al., G.R. 248827, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### OBLIGATIONS

Extinguishment of 
- In Allandale Sportsline, Inc., et al. v. The Good Dev't. Corp., we held: Tender of payment, without more, produces no effect; rather, tender of payment must be followed by a valid consignation in order to produce the effect of payment and extinguish an obligation; tender of payment is but a preparatory act to consignation. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

- It is the manifestation by the debtor of a desire to comply with or pay an obligation; if refused without just cause, the tender of payment will discharge the debtor of the obligation to pay but only after a valid consignation of the sum due shall have been made with the proper court. (Spouses Garcia vs. Spouses Soriano, G.R. 219431, Aug. 24, 2020)

Fraud 
- In its general sense, fraud is deemed to comprise anything calculated to deceive, including all acts and omissions and concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty, trust, or confidence justly reposed, resulting in damage to another, or by which an undue and unconscientious advantage is taken of another. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### PAROLE

Eligibility for parole 
- In A.M. No. 15-08-02-SC, this Court set the guidelines for the use of the phrase "without eligibility for parole" to remove any confusion, to wit: 1. In cases where the death penalty is not warranted, there is no need to use the phrase "without eligibility of parole'" to qualify the penalty of reclusion perpetua; it is understood that convicted persons penalized with an indivisible penalty are not eligible for parole; and 2. When circumstances are present warranting the imposition of the death penalty, but this penalty is not imposed because of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9346, the qualification of ''without eligibility of parole" shall be used to qualify reclusion perpetua in order to emphasize that the accused should have been sentenced to suffer the death penalty had it not been for R.A. 9346. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 243988, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### PARTIES

Real parties-in-interest 
- The allegations in their complaint that they and their predecessors-in-interest had always owned and possessed Lot 1324 clearly make them real parties-in-interest who have a cause of action against petitioners' predecessor-in-interest who wrongfully included a portion thereof in his title; interest within the meaning of the Rules of Court means material interest or an interest in issue to be affected by the decree or judgment of the case. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The rule is that the answer should be admitted when it is filed before a declaration of default provided there is no showing that defendant intends to delay the proceedings and no prejudice is caused to the plaintiff. (Vitarich Corporation vs. Dagmil, G.R. 217138, Aug. 27, 2020)

- We have enunciated in Sablas v. Sablas the principle that it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to permit the defendant to file his answer and to be heard on the merits even after the reglementary period for filing the responsive pleading expires. (Vitarich Corporation vs. Dagmil, G.R. 217138, Aug. 27, 2020)

Caption 
- The error within the title's caption in the resolution dismissing petitioners' motion for reconsideration is not equivalent to a misapprehension of facts; the inclusion of the names of parties in the caption of a pleading is only a formal requirement, for what is controlling are the allegations contained within. (Alliance of Non-Life Insurance Workers of the Philippines, Represented by Jubert Maun as President, et al. vs. Hon. Leandro R. Mendoza, as Secretary, Department of Transportation and Communications, et al., G.R. 206159, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### PHILIPPINE NURSING LAW (R.A. 877)

Application of 
- Under Section 16 of R.A. 877 as amended, any person who practices nursing in the Philippines, unless exempt, must possess a valid certificate of registration; violation of this provision amounts to illegal practice of the nursing profession. (Civil Service Commission vs. Rodriguez, G.R. 248255, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION – STANDARD EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT (POEA-SEC)

Disability benefits 
- If the seafarer suffers from an illness or injury during the term of the contract, the process in Section 20(A) applies; the employer is obliged to continue to pay the seafarer's wages, and to cover the cost of treatment and medical repatriation, if needed; after medical repatriation, the seafarer has the duty to report to the company-designated physician within three days upon his return; the employer shall then pay sickness allowance while the seafarer is being treated. (Maryville Manila, Inc. vs. Espinosa, G.R. 229372, Aug. 27, 2020)

- In resolving claims for disability benefits, it is imperative to integrate the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration-Standard Employment Contract (POEA-SEC) with every agreement between a seafarer and his employer; in Ventis Maritime Corporation v. Salenga, we clarified that Section 20-A of the POEA-SEC is irrelevant if the seafarer did not suffer an illness or injury during the term of his contract; rather, it is Section 32-A of the POEA-SEC which will apply if the illness manifests or is discovered after the term of the seafarer's contract. (Maryville Manila, Inc. vs. Espinosa, G.R. 229372, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The award of compensation and disability benefits cannot rest on speculations, presumptions and conjectures; although labor contracts are impressed with public interest and the provisions of the POEA-SEC must be construed logically and liberally in favor of Filipino seamen in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels, still the rule is that justice is in every case for the deserving, to be dispensed with in the light of established facts, the applicable law, and existing jurisprudence. (Maryville Manila, Inc. vs. Espinosa, G.R. 229372, Aug. 27, 2020)

Work-related illness 
- A final, conclusive and definite assessment must clearly state whether the seafarer is fit to work or the exact disability rating, or whether such illness is work-related, and without any further condition or treatment; it should no longer require any further action on the part of the company-designated physician and it is issued by the company-designated physician after he or she has exhausted all possible treatment options within the periods mandated by law. (Corcoro, Jr. vs. Magsaysay Mol Marine, Inc., et al., G.R. 226779, Aug. 24, 2020)

- It is settled that when it is shown that the seafarer's work may have contributed to the establishment or, at the very least, aggravation of any pre-existing disease, the condition/illness suffered by the seafarer shall be compensable. (Corcoro, Jr. vs. Magsaysay Mol Marine, Inc., et al., G.R. 226779, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The POEA-SEC defines a work-related illness as any sickness resulting from an occupational disease under the non-exhaustive list in Section 32-A. (Corcoro, Jr. vs. Magsaysay Mol Marine, Inc., et al., G.R. 226779, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Under Section 20(A) of the POEA-SEC, an employer shall be liable for a seafarer's illness or injury when it is proven that: (1) the injury or illness is work-related; and (2) the work-related injury or illness existed during the term of the seafarer's employment contract. (Corcoro, Jr. vs. Magsaysay Mol Marine, Inc., et al., G.R. 226779, Aug. 24, 2020)

- We emphasize the importance of compliance by the company and the company-designated physician in issuing a final and definitive assessment within the 12/240 day mandated periods; for only with said assessment can the seafarer then seek the opinion of his or her personal physician; the periods are mandatory to prevent the seafarer from endlessly waiting for a declaration of fitness to work or disability grading from the company and the company-designated physician. (Corcoro, Jr. vs. Magsaysay Mol Marine, Inc., et al., G.R. 226779, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### PRESCRIPTION

Prescription of actions for reconveyance 
- An action for reconveyance may be barred by prescription; an exception is when the property in dispute is in actual possession of the plaintiff; such plaintiff has a right to wait until his or her possession is disturbed or his or her title is questioned before initiating an action to vindicate his or her right. (Heirs of Pedro Hernando and Pacita Ronquillo, represented by Belen B. Ortiz, et al. vs. Spouses Gamboa, G.R. 233055, Aug. 19, 2020)

Prescription of ownership and other real rights; acquisitive prescription 
- Open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession of the subject lot for more than thirty years. (Heirs of Eutiquio Elliot, represented by Meriquita Elliot, et al. vs. Corcuera, G.R. 233767, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### PRESUMPTIONS

Presumption of regularity in the performance of duties 
- Police officers are generally presumed to have regularly performed their duties and their testimonies in criminal cases are given credence; their extensive training and the gravity of their sworn duty to protect the peace give weight to their observations in the field; the presumption, however, can be overturned when there is evidence to the contrary. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### PUBLIC LAND ACT (C.A. NO. 141)

Free patent application 
- In Republic v. Roasa, We clarified that a possessor or occupant of property may be a possessor in the concept of an owner prior to the determination that the property is alienable and disposable agricultural land; the computation of the period of possession may include the period of adverse possession prior to the declaration that the land is alienable and disposable. (Valdez, et al. vs. Heirs of Antero Catabas, G.R. 201655, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Under Section 11 of C.A. No. 141, there are two modes of disposing public lands through confirmation of imperfect or incomplete titles: (1) by judicial confirmation; and (2) by administrative legalization, otherwise known as the grant of free patents. (Valdez, et al. vs. Heirs of Antero Catabas, G.R. 201655, Aug. 24, 2020)

Reversion cases 
- The Republic's interest in reversion cases is statutorily recognized; Section 101 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, or the Public Land Act provides: "All actions for the reversion to the Government of lands of the public domain or improvements thereon shall be instituted by the Solicitor-General or the officer acting in his stead, in the proper courts, in the name of the Commonwealth of the Philippines." (Republic vs. Sundiam, et al., G.R. 236381, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND EMPLOYEES

Conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service 
- While there is no concrete definition under civil service laws of conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, the following acts or omissions have been treated as such: misappropriation of public funds; abandonment of office; failure to report back to work without prior notice; failure to safekeep public records and property; making false entries in public documents (i.e. PDS); falsification of court orders; a judge's act of brandishing a gun, and threatening the complainants during a traffic altercation, among others. (Civil Service Commission vs. Rodriguez, G.R. 248255, Aug. 27, 2020)

Dishonesty 
- Dishonesty is defined as "intentionally making a false statement on any material fact, or practicing or attempting to practice any deception or fraud in securing his examination, appointment, or registration; it is a serious offense which reflects a person's character and exposes the moral decay which virtually destroys his honor, virtue, and integrity." (Civil Service Commission vs. Rodriguez, G.R. 248255, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Dishonesty need not be committed in the course of the performance of duty by the person charged; the rationale is that if a government officer or employee is dishonest or is guilty of oppression or grave misconduct, even if said defects of character are not connected with his or her office, they affect his or her right to continue public service. (Civil Service Commission vs. Rodriguez, G.R. 248255, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### QUALIFIED RAPE

Elements 
- Jurisprudence has been clear in laying down the elements of qualified rape, especially incestuous rape; these elements are: (a) the victim is a female over 12 years but under 18 years of age; (b) the offender is a parent, ascendant, stepparent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim; and (c) the offender has carnal knowledge of the victim either through force, threat, or intimidation. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The elements of qualified rape are: (1) sexual congress; (2) with a woman; (3) done by force and without consent; (4) the victim is under 18 years of age at the time of the rape; (5) the offender is a parent, ascendant, step-parent, guardian, relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree, or the common-law spouse of the parent of the victim." (People vs. Manlolo, G.R. 227841, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### RAPE

Commission of 
- The Court has recognized that many incidents of rape were not always committed in secluded places; as aptly stated by the Court, "lust is no respecter of time or place, and rape defies constraints of time and space." (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The following are the elements of the offense: (a) the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman; and (b) he accomplished this act under the circumstances mentioned in the provision, e.g., through force, threat or intimidation; the gravamen of rape is sexual intercourse with a woman against her will. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The lack of resistance of AAA cannot be taken as evidence that rape was not committed; physical resistance to a rape need not be established where it is shown that the rape victim was threatened or intimidated into submission by the assailant. (People vs. Evardone, G.R. 248204, Aug. 24, 2020)

- In People v. Niebres, the fact that the accused did not dispute the victim's mental retardation during trial is insufficient to qualify the crime of Rape; this does not necessarily create moral certainty that the accused knew of the victim's disability. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 243988, Aug. 27, 2020)

Sweetheart theory 
- A "love affair" neither justifies rape nor serves as license, for lust; in addition, the filing of criminal charges are not acts of a woman savoring a consensual coitus but that of a maiden seeking retribution for the outrage committed against her. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 243988, Aug. 27, 2020)

- As an affirmative defense, the "sweetheart" theory must be supported by convincing evidence, such as mementos, love letters, notes, and photographs. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 243988, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### RAPE BY SEXUAL ASSAULT

Elements 
- People v. Bagsic enumerated the elements of rape by sexual assault, viz.: (1) The offender commits an act of sexual assault; (2) The act of sexual assault is committed by any of the following means: (a) By inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice; or (b) By inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; (3) That the act of sexual assault is accomplished under any of the following circumstances: (a) By using force and intimidation; (b) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; or (d) When the woman is under 12 years of age or demented. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The following are the elements of Rape by Sexual Assault under Article 266-A(2) of the RPC: (1) That the offender commits an act of sexual assault; (2) That the act of sexual assault is committed by any of the following means: (a) By inserting his penis into another person's mouth or anal orifice; or (b) By inserting any instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another person; (3) That the act of sexual assault is accomplished under any of the following circumstances: (a) By using force and intimidation; (b) When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; or (c) By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority; or (d) When the woman is under 12 years of age or demented. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### REALTY INSTALLMENT BUYER PROTECTION ACT (R.A. 6552)

Application of 
- The Realty Installment Buyer Protection Act, otherwise known as R.A. 6552 or the Maceda Law, protects "buyers of real estate on installment payments against onerous and oppressive conditions"; one of the legal features of R.A. 6552 is Section 4 thereof, which provides for the remedies of a defaulting buyer that has paid less than two years of installment amortizations for a purchase of real property. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

Conditions before a seller may cancel a contract 
- Section 4 of R.A. 6552 requires four (4) conditions before the seller may actually cancel the contract thereunder: first, the defaulting buyer has paid less than two (2) years of installments; second, the seller must give such defaulting buyer a sixty (60)-day grace period, reckoned from the date the installment became due; third, if the buyer fails to pay the installments due at the expiration of the said grace period, the seller must give the buyer a notice of cancellation and/or a demand for rescission by notarial act; and fourth, the seller may actually cancel the contract only after the lapse of thirty (30) days from the buyer's receipt of the said notice of cancellation and/or demand for rescission by notarial act. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

Deed of rescission 
- Rescission is an act or a deed, directly or impliedly done, where a contract is cancelled, annulled, or abrogated by the parties, one of them, or by the court; an act or a deed of rescission is distinct and separate from an allegation of rescission, an allegation being an assertion, declaration, or statement of a party to an action, contained generally in an affidavit or a legal pleading, setting out what is yet to be proven. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

Notarial rescission 
- A notarial rescission contemplated under R.A. 6552 is a unilateral cancellation by a seller of a perfected contract thereunder acknowledged by a notary public and accompanied by competent evidence of identity; this notarial notice of rescission has peculiar technical requirements. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

Remedies of the defaulting buyer 
- We point out that a defaulting buyer of real property on installments, whether or not she or he has paid two (2) years of installments, has three (3) common legal remedies in the absence of a valid rescission, granted by Section 6 of R.A. 6552 and jurisprudence: (a) Pay in advance any installment at any time, necessarily without interest; (b) Pay the full unpaid balance of the purchase price at any time without interest, and to have such full payment of the purchase price annotated in the certificate of title covering the real property subject of the transaction under R.A. 9552; or (c) Claim an equitable refund of prior payments and/or deposits made by the defaulting buyer to the seller pertinent to their transaction under R.A. 9552, if any. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### RES JUDICATA

Bar by prior judgment 
- A bar by prior judgment exists when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. (ASB Realty Corporation, represented by Elena F. Felipe vs. Espenesin, Registrar, Register of Deeds of Pasig City, G.R. 207059, Aug. 19, 2020)

Conclusiveness of judgment 
- Conclusiveness of judgment under Section 47(c) operates under the same element, except that there is identity only of issues and parties, but not of causes of action; for this reason, except in those instances allowed under the law or rules of court, a former final judgment rendered by a competent court in another action between the same parties based on a different claim or cause of action will not bar a second case; however, as said former final judgment is conclusive, "any right, fact, or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein, and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same." (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- There is conclusiveness of judgment when there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. (ASB Realty Corporation, represented by Elena F. Felipe vs. Espenesin, Registrar, Register of Deeds of Pasig City, G.R. 207059, Aug. 19, 2020)

- There is res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment when all the following elements are present: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, but not identity of causes of action. (Heirs of Eutiquio Elliot, represented by Meriquita Elliot, et al. vs. Corcuera, G.R. 233767, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Unlike res judicata by prior judgment, where there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action, there is only identity of parties and subject matter in res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment; since there is no identity of cause of action, the judgment in the first case is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined. (Heirs of Eutiquio Elliot, represented by Meriquita Elliot, et al. vs. Corcuera, G.R. 233767, Aug. 27, 2020)

Principle of 
- A final judgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies; respondent is barred, either by operation of res judicata or through its express recognition in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), from asserting any misrepresentation on the part of petitioner with respect to the ownership issue which had already been conclusively settled through a final judgment. (Unirock Corporation, as represented by Edison U. Ojerio vs. Carpio, et al., G.R. 213421, Aug. 24, 2020)

- A re-litigation of the facts and issues would violate the res judicata rule, which is rooted on public policy; and the purpose is to avoid multiplicity of suits; Section 47(b) and Section 47(c) of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court embody the doctrine of res judicata, that is, bar by prior judgment and conclusiveness of judgment, respectively. (ASB Realty Corporation, represented by Elena F. Felipe vs. Espenesin, Registrar, Register of Deeds of Pasig City, G.R. 207059, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The doctrine of res judicata under Section 47(b), Rule 39, Rules of Court bars a second case on the basis of a former final judgment if the following elements are present: there is a former final judgment that was rendered on the merits; the court in the former judgment had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and there is identity of parties, subject matter and cause of action between the first and second cases. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

Two concepts 
- There are two concepts of res judicata: 1) res judicata by bar by prior judgment; and 2) res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment; res judicata by bar by prior judgment precludes the filing of a second case when it has the same parties, same subject, and same cause of action, or otherwise prays for the same relief as the first case; res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment precludes the questioning of a fact or issue in a second case if the fact or issue has already been judicially determined in the first case between the same parties. (Heirs of Eutiquio Elliot, represented by Meriquita Elliot, et al. vs. Corcuera, G.R. 233767, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### REVISED GUIDELINES FOR CONTINUOUS TRIAL OF CRIMINAL CASES (A.M. NO. 15-06-10-SC)

Application of 
- A delay either during the preliminary investigation stage, the trial of the case, or the resolution of a mere incidental or interlocutory matter, in a way that is oppressive, capricious and vexatious, constitutes a violation of the right of a party to speedy trial or disposition, warranting the ouster of the court of jurisdiction and the dismissal of the case. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Delay in one segment of the proceedings which does not stall the main proceedings in the entire case does not give rise to a violation of the right of a party to speedy trial or disposition of his or her case; much less, when the delay in one segment can be attributed to the conduct of said party of swarming the court with other incidental motions and petitions that can sap its time and attention; bail proceedings need not be comprehensive or detailed, for all that is required is a mere summary treatment of a limited question of whether there is strong evidence against the bail applicant. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Even if the delay occurred in only one segment of the proceedings or on the resolution of an interlocutory matter, the delay amounts to the violation of the party's right to speedy trial or disposition which will lead to the dismissal of the entire case, where there is evidence that the segment delay stalled the entire proceedings in a way that is vexatious, capricious and oppressive; the delay in resolving petitioner's application for bail was not oppressive and vexatious, as the delay was due to the numerous and simultaneous incidents initiated by the petitioner and her co-accused which the Sandiganbayan had to resolve, in addition to the main case. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### ROBBERY

Simple robbery 
- The "intimate connection" essential for a robbery with homicide was ill-established; even accused-appellant's alleged act of reaching into the laptop bag, which could be construed as a threat, occurred after Sigua had been shot tending to show that he had not performed any act that directly led to or caused Sigua's death; the homicide on the occasion of this robbery, which would make the crime robbery with homicide, was not proved beyond reasonable doubt; thus, accused-appellant may only be convicted of simple robbery under Article 294(5) of the Revised Penal Code. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE

Commission of 
- In robbery with homicide, the original criminal design of the malefactor is to commit robbery, with homicide perpetrated on the occasion or by reason of the robbery; the intent to commit robbery must precede the taking of human life; the homicide may take place before, during or after the robbery; it is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes or modes or persons intervening in the commission of the crime that has to be taken into consideration. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Not all deaths on the occasion of a robbery have been considered by this Court as one of robbery with homicide; for one, if the robbery was committed by a band, and the accused was proven to have attempted to prevent the assaults committed by their co-robbers during the robbery, they shall not be punished as a principal in any of the assaults the band committed pursuant to Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

- One who participated in a robbery, by reason or on occasion of which a homicide occurs even if the person did not take part in the killing is guilty of robbery with homicide; each conspirator answers for all the acts of the others committed for this accomplishment of the common purpose. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Robbery with homicide is committed when the robbers kill their victims, or bystanders who attempt to thwart the robbery, or responding police officers; this Court reasoned that, in robbery with homicide, the victim of the robbery did not need to be the victim of the homicide. (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

Elements 
- The elements of robbery with homicide are: "(1) the taking of personal property with violence or intimidation against persons; (2) the property taken belongs to another; (3) the taking was done with animo lucrandi; and (4) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, homicide was committed." (People vs. Daguman, alias "Mark," G.R. 219116, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### ROBBERY WITH RAPE

Commission of 
- Article 294, paragraph 1 of the RPC, states that the penalty of reclusion perpetua to death is to be imposed when on the occasion of the robbery, a rape was committed; Article 63 of the RPC provides that when the penalty is composed of two indivisible penalties and neither an aggravating nor mitigating circumstance is present, the lesser penalty is to be imposed. (People vs. Evardone, G.R. 248204, Aug. 24, 2020)

- By removing culpability for the complex crime from an accused who endeavors to prevent the rape, the law recognizes the less perverse state of his mind vis-á-vis that of the perpetrator of the rape and that of his co-accused who did not even attempt to prevent the same despite an opportunity to do so. (People vs. Agaton, G.R. 251631, Aug. 27, 2020)

- It is a settled rule that when conspiracy is established between several accused in the commission of the crime of robbery, they would all be equally culpable for the rape committed by anyone of them on the occasion of the robbery, unless anyone of them proves that he endeavored to prevent the others from committing rape. (People vs. Agaton, G.R. 251631, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The long line of jurisprudence on the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape requires that the accused be aware of the sexual act in order for him to have the opportunity to attempt to prevent the same, without which he cannot be faulted for his inaction. (People vs. Agaton, G.R. 251631, Aug. 27, 2020)

- To be convicted of the special complex crime of Robbery with Rape, the original intent of the accused was to take, with intent to gain, the personal property of the victim, and rape was just committed on the occasion thereof. (People vs. Evardone, G.R. 248204, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### 2004 RULES ON NOTARIAL PRACTICE

Application of 
- Community tax certificates or cedulas are impermissible proof of identity for their established unreliability and the considerable ease in securing their issuance, thereby justifying their eventual exclusion from the list of competent evidence of identity that notaries public should use in ascertaining the identity of persons appearing before them. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

- Under notarial rules, acknowledgments cover written deeds and acts, whereas jurats confirm affidavits and pleadings; the foregoing thus defined, a deed of rescission notarized via acknowledgment is already a piece of evidence all on its own; on the other hand, an allegation of rescission contained in an affidavit or a pleading and confirmed by a notarial jurat still remains to be proved; it merely implies that the signatory thereof sets out to prove the fact of the rescission before a notary public. (Pryce Properties Corp. (now Pryce Corporation) vs. Nolasco, Jr., G.R. 203990, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### SALES

Buyers in good faith 
- In Spouses Bautista v. Silva: a holder of registered title may invoke the status of a buyer for value in good faith as a defense against any action questioning his title; such status, however, is never presumed but must be proven by the person invoking it; a buyer for value in good faith is one who buys property of another, without notice that some other person has a right to, or interest in, such property and pays the full and fair price for the same, at the time of such purchase, or before he has notice of the claim or interest of some other persons in the property. (Heirs of Isabelo Cudal, Sr., Represented by Libertad Cudal, et al. vs. Spouses Suguitan, Jr., G.R. 244405, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### SEARCHES AND SEIZURES

Exclusionary rule 
- Section 2, Article III of the Constitution ordains the right of the people against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government; fortifying such right is the exclusionary principle adopted in Section 3(b), Article III of the Constitution; the principle renders any evidence obtained through unreasonable search or seizure as inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding. (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

Plain view doctrine 
- In Miclat, Jr. v. People, we identified the three (3) requisites that must concur in order to validly invoke the doctrine, to wit: The "plain view" doctrine applies when the following requisites concur: (a) the law enforcement officer in search of the evidence has a prior justification for an intrusion or is in a position from which he can view a particular area; (b) the discovery of evidence in plain view is inadvertent; (c) it is immediately apparent to the officer that the item he observes may be evidence of a crime, contraband or otherwise subject to seizure. (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

- In order to satisfy the third requisite of the plain view doctrine, it must be established that the seized item on the basis of the attending facts and surrounding circumstances reasonably appeared, to the officer who made the seizure, as a contraband or an evidence of a crime. (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The first requisite of the plain view doctrine assumes that the law enforcement officer has "a prior justification for an intrusion or is in a position from which he can view a particular area"; this means that the officer who made the warrantless seizure must have been in a lawful position when he discovered the target contraband or evidence in plain view. (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Under the plain view doctrine, objects falling within the plain view of a law enforcement officer, who has a right to be in a position to have that view, may be validly seized by such officer without a warrant and, thus, may be introduced in evidence; an object is deemed in plain view when it is "open to eye and hand" or is "plainly exposed to sight." (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

Search warrant 
- The rule of thumb, as may be deduced from Section 2, Article III of the Constitution itself, is that searches and seizures which are undertaken by the government outside the auspices of a valid search warrant are considered unreasonable; to be regarded reasonable, government-led search and seizure must generally be sanctioned by a judicial warrant issued in accordance with requirements prescribed in the aforementioned constitutional provision. (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

Warrantless searches and seizures 
- Jurisprudence has recognized several, though very specific, instances where warrantless searches and seizures can be considered reasonable and, hence, not subject to the exclusionary principle; some of these instances, studied throughout our case law, are: 1. Consented searches; 2. Searches incidental to a lawful arrest; 3. Searches of a moving vehicle; 4. Seizures of evidence in plain view; 5. Searches incident of inspection, supervision and regulation sanctioned by the State in the exercise of its police power; 6. Customs searches; 7. Stop and Frisk searches; and 8. Searches under exigent and emergency circumstances. (Pilapil, Jr. vs. Co, G.R. 228608, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSONS

Actions by and against executors and administrators 
- Section 2, Rule 87 of the Rules of Court provides: "For the recovery or protection of the property or rights of the deceased, an executor or administrator may bring or defend, in the right of the deceased, actions for causes which survive. (Tirol vs. Nolasco, G.R. 230103, Aug. 27, 2020)

Jurisdiction 
- In the settlement of a deceased's estate, Section 1, Rule 73 of the Rules of Court provides: "The court first taking cognizance of the settlement of the estate of a decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts." (Tirol vs. Nolasco, G.R. 230103, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### SEXUAL ASSAULT

Article 266-A(2) of the Revised Penal Code in relation to Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610 
- In People v. Tulagan, the Court explained that: considering the development of the crime of sexual assault from a mere "crime against chastity" in the form of acts of lasciviousness to a "crime against persons" akin to rape, as well as the rulings in Dimakuta and Caoili, We hold that if the acts constituting sexual assault are committed against a victim under 12 years of age or is demented, the nomenclature of the offense should now be "Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. 7610" and no longer "Acts of Lasciviousness under Article 336 of the RPC in relation to Section 5 (b) of R.A. 7610," because sexual assault as a form of acts of lasciviousness is no longer covered by Article 336 but by Article 266-A (2) of the RPC, as amended by R.A. 8353; nevertheless, the imposable penalty is still reclusion temporal in its medium period, and not prision mayor. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020) 

#### SOCIAL SECURITY ACT OF 1954 (R.A. 1161), AS AMENDED

Application of 
- Failure to comply with the reportorial requirements does not result in the automatic cancellation of the membership of the covered employee. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020)

- R.A. 1161 did not expressly cover self-employed individuals; Section 11, however, allows a person previously employed to continue paying contributions in order to retain his or her benefits as a member; the eligibility requirements for retirement benefits are set forth under Section 12-B of the law, as amended; to be eligible for retirement benefits, it must be established that (a) she is a covered employee, (b) paid at least 120 contributions prior to the semester of her retirement, (c) has reached the age of 60, and (d) is not receiving monthly compensation of at least P300.00. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The cancellation of membership and retirement pension of a member before according her an opportunity to be heard on her eligibility is a deprivation of due process. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### SPECIAL PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AGAINST ABUSE, EXPLOITATION AND DISCRIMINATION ACT (R.A. 7610)

Application of 
- R.A. 7610 was enacted in order to protect children from abuse, exploitation, and discrimination by adults and not by persons who are also children themselves; Section 5 of RA 7610 expressly states that a child is deemed to be sexually abused when coerced or influenced by an adult, syndicate, or group. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

Children defined 
- R.A. 7610 defines "children" as persons below eighteen (18) years of age or those over but are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or condition. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### STARE DECISIS

Principle of 
- In De Mesa v. Pepsi Cola Products Phils., Inc.: The principle of stare decisis et non quieta movere is entrenched in Article 8 of the Civil Code; it enjoins adherence to judicial precedents; it requires our courts to follow a rule already established in a final decision of the Supreme Court; that decision becomes a judicial precedent to be followed in subsequent cases by all courts in the land. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The doctrine of stare decisis is based on the principle that once a question of law has been examined and decided, it should be deemed settled and closed to further argument. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The principle of stare decisis applies only to final decisions of this Court, because only this Court may create judicial precedents that other courts should follow. (Gotesco Properties, Inc. vs. International Exchange Bank (Now Union Bank of the Philippines), G.R. 212262, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### STATUTES

Effectivity of 
- Article 4 of the Civil Code provides that "laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided; correlatively, Article 8 of the same Code declares that "judicial decisions applying the laws or the Constitution shall form part of the legal system of the Philippines." (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

- As a rule, judicial interpretations form part of the law upon the date of effectivity of the said law, and the exception to this is when a doctrine of the Court overturns or reverses a previous doctrine and adopts a different view, in which case the new doctrine must be applied prospectively. (Ramos, et al. vs. National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP), et al., G.R. 192112, Aug. 19, 2020)

#### STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION

Penal statutes 
- It is a basic rule in statutory construction that penal statutes are construed against the State and in favor of the accused; the reason for this principle is the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals and the object is to establish a certain rule by conformity to which mankind would be safe, and the discretion of the court limited; the purpose of strict construction is not to enable a guilty person to escape punishment through a technicality but to provide a precise definition of forbidden acts. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

Rules of procedure 
- In De Guzman v. Sandiganbayan, we decreed: the Rules of Court was conceived and promulgated to set forth guidelines in the dispensation of justice but not to bind and chain the hand that dispenses it, for otherwise, courts will be mere slaves to or robots of technical rules, shorn of judicial discretion; that is precisely why courts in rendering real justice have always been, as they in fact ought to be, conscientiously guided by the norm that when on the balance, technicalities take a backseat against substantive rights, and not the other way around. (Mascariñas vs. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc., G.R. 228138, Aug, 27, 2020)

- Rules of procedure are mere tools designed to expedite the decision or resolution of cases and other matters pending in court and a strict and rigid application of rules that would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote substantial justice must be avoided. (PO1 Delos Santos vs. People, et al., G.R. 231765, Aug. 24, 2020)

- The relaxation of the strict application of the rules may only be allowed if it would accommodate the greater interest of justice in light of the prevailing circumstances of the case, such as where strong considerations of substantive justice are manifest in the petition. (Jayme vs. Jayme, et al., G.R. 248827, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Well-entrenched is the rule that the Court may relax the strict application of the rules of procedure in the exercise of its equity jurisdiction if its rigid application will tend to obstruct rather than serve the broader interests of justice; until then, the procedural rules are accorded utmost respect and due regard as they are designed to facilitate the adjudication of cases to remedy the worsening problem of delay in the resolution of rival claims and in the administration of justice. (Jayme vs. Jayme, et al., G.R. 248827, Aug. 27, 2020)

- When strict application of the rules would result in irreparable damage, if not grave injustice to a litigant, as in this case, the Court is compelled to relax the rules in the higher interest of substantial justice. (Mascariñas vs. BPI Family Savings Bank, Inc., G.R. 228138, Aug, 27, 2020)

Social legislation cases 
- Suffice it to state that in cases involving social legislation, doubts should be liberally construed in favor of the intended beneficiary of the law. (Salabe vs. Social Security Commission, et al., G.R. 223018, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### STATUTORY RAPE

Commission of 
- It is termed statutory rape as it departs from the usual modes of committing rape; the law presumes that the victim does not and cannot have a will of her own on account of her tender years; what the law punishes in Statutory Rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below 12 years old. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

- It must be remembered that statutory rape, as punished under Article 266-A of the Revised Penal Code and amended by Republic Act No. 8353, paragraph 1(d), is different compared to other forms of rape. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- What the law punishes in statutory rape is carnal knowledge of a woman below twelve (12) years old; thus, force, intimidation and physical evidence of injury are not relevant considerations; the only subject of inquiry is the age of the woman and whether carnal knowledge took place. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

Elements 
- Committed when: (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (2) the accused had carnal knowledge of her, regardless of whether there was force, threat or intimidation, whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness, or whether it was done through fraud or grave abuse of authority. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The crime of statutory rape is defined under Article 266-A, paragraph l(d) of the RPC; as amended by RA No. 8353, and has the following elements: (1) the offended party is under 12 years of age; and (2) the accused had carnal knowledge of the victim; it is committed regardless of whether there was force, threat, or intimidation; fraud or grave abuse of authority; and whether the victim was deprived of reason or consciousness; it is enough that the age of the victim is proven and that there was sexual intercourse. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 243988, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### SUMMONS

Service of 
- Rule 14, Section 11 of the 1997 Rules of Court provides the manner of serving summons to a corporation, thus Sec. 11. Service upon domestic private juridical entity, when the defendant is a corporation, partnership or association organized under the laws of the Philippines with a juridical personality, service may be made on the president, managing partner, general manager, corporate secretary, treasurer, or in-house counsel. (Integrated Micro Electronics, Inc. vs. Standard Insurance Co., Inc., G.R. 210302, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### SUPREME COURT

A.M. No. 00-2-14-SC (Re: Computation of time when the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday and a motion for extension filed on next working day is granted) 
- When the last day of the filing period falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the place where the court sits, the time shall not run until the next working day. (Inocentes, Jr., et al. vs. R. Syjuco Construction, Inc. (RSCI), et al., G.R. 240549, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### 2019 SUPREME COURT REVISED RULES ON CHILDREN IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW

Application of 
- The 2019 Supreme Court Revised Rules on Children in Conflict with the Law which took effect on July 7, 2019 ordains that the best interest of the child shall be taken into consideration in judging a minor offender, to wit: Section 44. Guiding Principles in Judging the Child - Subject to the provisions of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and other special laws, the judgment against a child in conflict with the law shall be guided by the following principles: (1) The judgment shall be in proportion to the gravity of the offense, and shall consider the circumstances and the best interest of the child, the rights of the victim, and the needs of society in line with the demands of balanced and restorative justice. (2) Restrictions on the personal liberty of the child shall be limited to the minimum. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### TAXATION

Final assessment notice 
- As held in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Fitness by Design, Inc.: a final assessment is a notice "to the effect that the amount therein stated is due as tax and a demand for payment thereof"; this demand for payment signals the time "when penalties and interests begin to accrue against the taxpayer and enabling the latter to determine his remedies; thus, it must be "sent to and received by the taxpayer, and must demand payment of the taxes described therein within a specific period."

- Even if the final assessment notice and assessment notices attached thereto were duly served on and received by the taxpayer, they are still void and without any legal consequence, where the same did not prescribe a definite period for the taxpayer to pay the assessed deficiency taxes. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) 
- Section 228 of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, requires the assessment to inform the taxpayer in writing of the law and the facts on which the assessment is made; otherwise, the assessment shall be void. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

Revenue Regulations (RR) 12-99 
- The deficiency income tax and value-added tax assessments are void where the taxpayer was not accorded due process in their issuance. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. T Shuttle Services, Inc., G.R. 240729, Aug. 24, 2020)

#### THEFT

Elements of 
- Under Article 308 of the RPC, the essential elements of theft are: (1) the taking of personal property; (2) the property belongs to another; (3) the taking away done with intent of gain; (4) the taking away was done without the consent of the owner; and (5) the taking away is accomplished without violence or intimidation against person or force upon things. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

#### USE OF FALSIFIED DOCUMENT IN ANY TRANSACTION (OTHER THAN AS EVIDENCE IN A JUDICIAL PROCEEDING)

Commission of 
- In the crime of use of falsified document, the person who used the forged document is different from the one who falsified it such that "if the one who used the falsified document is the same person who falsified it, the crime is only falsification and the use of the same is not a separate crime"; falsification of a public document and use of false document by the same person who falsified it constitute but a single crime of falsification. (Jayme vs. Jayme, et al., G.R. 248827, Aug. 27, 2020)

Elements of 

- The elements of the crime of use of falsified document in any transaction (other than as evidence in a judicial proceeding) are: (1) the offender knew that a document was falsified by another person; (2) the false document is embraced in Article 171 or in any of subdivision Nos. 1 and 2 of Article 172; (3) he used such document (not in judicial proceedings); and (4) the use of the false document caused damage to another or at least it was used with intent to cause such damage. (Jayme vs. Jayme, et al., G.R. 248827, Aug. 27, 2020)

#### WITNESSES

Credibility of 


- Absent evidence that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he/she was not so actuated and his/her testimony is entitled to full credence. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

- Based on jurisprudence, the testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, for when a woman or a girl-child says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was indeed committed." (People vs. Manlolo, G.R. 227841, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Inconsistencies on inconsequential matters that have nothing to do with the elements of the crime cannot result to the acquittal of the accused-appellant. (People vs. Evardone, G.R. 248204, Aug. 24, 2020)

- It is well-settled that minor inconsistencies in the testimony of the victim does not automatically discredit the credibility of the witness; it should be borne in mind that minor inconsistencies are to be expected when a victim recalls her harrowing and traumatic experience which are commonly too painful and agonizing to recount, especially in a courtroom setting. (People vs. Evardone, G.R. 248204, Aug. 24, 2020)

- No woman, least of all a child, would concoct a story of defloration, allow examination of her private parts and subject herself to public trial or ridicule if she has not, in truth, been a victim of rape and impelled to seek justice for the wrong done to her being; "when the offended party is of tender age and immature, courts are inclined to give credit to her account of what transpired, considering not only her relative vulnerability but also the shame to which she would be exposed if the matter to which she testified is not true." (People vs. Manlolo, G.R. 227841, Aug. 19, 2020)

- The determination by the trial court of the credibility of witnesses, when affirmed by the appellate court, is accorded full weight and credit as well as great respect, if not conclusive effect. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The trial court gave full credence to complainant's positive, clear, and straightforward testimony; surely, the credible testimony of the victim in rape cases is sufficient to sustain a verdict of conviction. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The trial court is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses since it has observed firsthand their demeanor, conduct and attitude under grilling examination; absent any showing of a fact or circumstance of weight and influence which would appear to have been overlooked and, if considered, could affect the outcome of the case, the factual findings and assessment on the credibility of a witness made by the trial court remain binding on an appellate tribunal. (People vs. Soria, G.R. 248372, Aug. 27, 2020)

- The trial court's evaluation of the credibility of witnesses is entitled to the highest respect and will not be disturbed on appeal considering that the trial court is in a better position to decide such question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The trial court's findings on the issue of credibility of witnesses and the consequent findings of fact must be given great weight and respect on appeal, unless certain facts of substance and value have been overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case. (People vs. XYZ, G.R. 244255, Aug. 26, 2020)

- The well-established rule is that findings of the trial courts which are factual in nature and which involve credibility are accorded respect when no glaring errors; gross misapprehension of facts; or speculative, arbitrary and unsupported conclusion can be gathered from such findings. (Realiza vs. People, G.R. 228745, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Though not binding, the findings and conclusions of this Court in Napoles v. Sandiganbayan regarding the strength of the evidence of the prosecution on the existence of conspiracy involving Napoles and her co-accused, and the commission of acts of plunder and corruption by Napoles, must be taken into account by the Sandiganbayan for purposes of a complete assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the reliability of their testimonies. (Reyes vs. The Honorable Sandiganbayan Third Division, et al., G.R. 243411, Aug. 19, 2020)

- Time and again, the Court has held that when the decision hinges on the credibility of witnesses and their respective testimonies, the trial court's observations and conclusions deserve great respect and are often accorded finality; the reason therefor is that the trial judge enjoys the peculiar advantage of observing first-hand the deportment of the witnesses while testifying and is, therefore, in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions on the basis thereof. (People vs. XXX, G.R. 239906, Aug. 26, 2020)

- When a rape victim's testimony is straightforward and candid, unshaken by rigid cross-examination and unflawed by inconsistencies or contradictions in its material points, the same must be given full faith and credit. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

Testimony of 
- It is settled that testimonies of child victims are given full weight and credit, because when a woman, more so if she is a minor, says that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that rape was committed; youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity. (People vs. HHH, G.R. 248245, Aug. 26, 2020)

- Settled is the rule that testimonies of child-victims are normally given full weight and credit; youth and immaturity are generally badges of truth and sincerity. (BBB vs. People, G.R. 249307, Aug. 27, 2020)
