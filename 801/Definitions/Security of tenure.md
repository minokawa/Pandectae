**Security of tenure**
> "One's employment, profession, trade or calling is a "property right" of which a worker may be deprived only upon compliance with due process requirements. 8 National Labor Union v. Court of Industrial Relations, 68 Phil 732 (1939).

> Security of tenure is a constitutionally guaranteed right. Employees may not be terminated from their regular employment except for just or authorized causes under the Labor Code and other pertinent laws. A mere change in the equity composition of a corporation is neither a just nor an authorized cause that would legally permit the dismissal of the corporation’s employees en masse. 

> They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.  -  Art. XIII, Sec. 3. p2 sentence 2 CONSTITUTION
