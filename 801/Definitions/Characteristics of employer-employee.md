Characteristics of employer-employee relationship
	The four-fold test, to wit: 
	(1) the selection and engagement of the employee; 
	(2) the payment of wages; 
	(3) the power of dismissal; and 
	(4) the power to control the employee's conduct, or the so-called "control test." 
	
To be clear, the test does not require that the employer actually supervises the performance of duties by the employee.
